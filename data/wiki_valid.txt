'''[[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]''' are two closely related [[Abrahamic religion]]s that are in some ways parallel to each other and in other ways fundamentally divergent in theology and practice. Whereas the article on the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition emphasizes continuities and convergences between the two religions, this article emphasizes that Judaism and Christianity each have widely diverging views of their respective relationship to the other, and of elements they have in common, such as the Bible and God. 

== Neither religion is monolithic ==

As with the article on the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, this article makes generalizations about Jewish and Christian beliefs and practices.  Nevertheless, it is very important to understand that neither religion is monolithic; there is no single &quot;Judaism&quot;, as there is no single &quot;Christianity&quot;.  Instead, there are wide variations on a theme concerning belief and practice both among ''individual'' Jews and Christians and between different Jewish and Christian ''groups''
(indeed, there exist some Christians and Jews who hold that other Christians and Jews are not in fact the same religion.)

== Raison d'être of the religion ==
Each religion has a [[mythos]], that is, an internal description of its [[raison d'être]].

That of Christianity is to provide all human beings with the only valid path to [[salvation]] (John 14:26, [[Great Commission]]).  Christians believe people are by [[original sin|nature sinful]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] was both the [[Son of God]] and [[Nicene Creed|God the Son]], [[God]] made [[incarnate]]; that Jesus' death by [[crucifixion]] was a [[Atonement|sacrifice to atone]] for all humanity's sins, and that acceptance of Jesus as the [[Christ]] saves one from [[sin]] ([[John 3:16]]). 

Judaism's raison d'être is to give concrete form to the [[covenant]] between [[God]] and the [[Jewish people]].  The Torah, both [[Torah|written]] and [[Rabbinic Judaism|oral]], both tell the story of this covenant, and provide Jews with the terms of the covenant.  The Torah (teaching) thus guides Jews to walk in God's ways (Deut 30:16), to help them learn how to live a holy life on earth, and to bring holiness into the world and into every part of life so that life may be elevated to a high level of sanctity (Lev 19:2). This will allow the Jewish people as a community to be a &quot;light unto the nations&quot; (Isa 42:6, 49:6, 60:3) over the course of history (ie, a [[role model]]) and part of the divine intent of bringing about an [[Kingdom of God#The Kingdom in Jewish thought|age of peace and sanctity]]. Judaism does not see the [[afterlife]] as a core part of this, or a major factor needed to justify why it is necessary. Ideally a faithful life and good deeds should be ends in themselves, not means.

== The nature of religion: national versus universal ==

[[Judaism]] does not characterize itself as a religion so much as a way of life (although one can speak of the Jewish religion and religious Jews).  The subject of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) is the history of the Children of [[Jacob|Israel]] (also called Hebrews), especially in terms of their relationship with [[God]]. Thus, Judaism has also been characterized as a culture or as a civilization. [[Rabbi]] [[Mordecai Kaplan]] defines Judaism as an evolving religious civilization. One crucial sign of this is that one need not believe, or even do, anything to be Jewish; the historic definition of 'Jewishness' requires only that one be born of a Jewish mother, or that one convert to Judaism in accord with [[halakha|Jewish law]]. (Today, [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Jews]] also include those born of Jewish fathers and Gentile mothers if the children are raised as Jews.) 

To religious [[Jew]]s, Jewish peoplehood is closely tied to their relationship with God, and thus has a strong theological component.  This relationship is encapsulated in the notion that Jews are a [[chosen people]].  Although many non-Jews have taken this as a sign of arrogance or exclusivity, Jewish scholars and theologians have emphasized that a special relationship between Jews and God does not in any way preclude other nations having their own relationship with God, and does not mean Jews are superior to members of other nations.  In this sense, &quot;chosen&quot; means chosen to undertake a duty, a responsibility or a role, rather than chosen as higher status or more deserving. For strictly observant Jews, being &quot;chosen&quot; fundamentally means that it was Gods wish that a group of people would exist in a [[covenant]] with Him, and would be bound to obey a certain set of laws (see [[Torah]] and [[halakha]]) as a duty of their covenant.  They view their divine purpose as being ideally a &quot;light upon the nations&quot; and a &quot;holy people&quot; (ie, a people who live their lives fully in accordance with Divine will), not &quot;the one path to God&quot;. 

Jews hold that other nations and peoples are not required (or expected) to obey Jewish law.  The only laws Judaism believes are automatically binding on other nations are known as the [[Noahide Laws|Seven Laws of Noah]] (which are humanitarian rather than religious). Thus, as a national religion, Judaism holds that others may have their own, different, paths to God (or holiness, or &quot;salvation&quot;).

Christianity, on the other hand, is characterized by its claim to universality, which marks a significant break from Jewish identity and thought.  Christians believe that Christianity represents the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and the nation of Israel, that Israel would be a blessing to all nations.  Although Christians generally believe their religion to be very inclusive (since not only Jews but all gentiles can be Christian), Jews see Christianity as highly exclusive, because it views non-Christians (such as Jews) as having an incomplete or imperfect relationship with God, and therefore excluded from grace, salvation, or heaven.  From this point of view, Christianity, despite its claims, is not universal.

This crucial difference between the two religions has other implications.  For example, [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Judaism|conversion to Judaism]] is more like a form of adoption, or changing national citizenship (i.e. becoming a formal member of the people, or tribe), whereas [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Christianity|conversion to Christianity]] is explicitly a declaration of faith. Depending on the denomination, this conversion sometimes has a social component, as the individual is in many ways adopted into a [[Church]], with a strong family model.  

Both Judaism and Christianity have been affected by the diverse cultures of their respective members.  For example, what Jews from Eastern Europe and from North Africa consider &quot;Jewish food&quot; has more in common with the cuisines of non-Jewish Eastern Europeans and North Africans than with each other.  According to non-Orthodox Jews and critical historians, Jewish law too has been affected by surrounding cultures (for example, some scholars argue that the establishment of absolute [[monotheism]] in Judaism was a reaction against the [[dualism]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] that Jews encountered when living under [[Persians|Persian]] rule; Jews rejected [[polygamy]] during the middle ages, influenced by their Christian neighbors).  According to Orthodox Jews too there are variations in Jewish custom from one part of the world to another.  It was for this reason that [[Joseph Karo]]'s [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] became established as the authoritative code of Jewish law after [[Moshe Isserlis]] added his commentary, documenting variations in local custom.

== Concepts of God ==

Both Jews and Christians believe in the [[God]] of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for Jews the God of the [[Tanakh]], for Christians the God of the [[Old Testament]], the [[Creator God|creator of the universe]].  Both religions reject the view that God is entirely [[immanent]], and within the world as a physical presence, (although Christians believe in the [[incarnation]] of God). Both religions reject the view that God is entirely [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and thus separate from the world, as the pre-Christian Greek [[Unknown God]], (although this can be argued in some Judaic thought). Both religions reject [[atheism]], on the one hand, and [[polytheism]], on the other. 

Both religions agree that God shares both transcendent and immanent qualities. How these religions resolve this issue is where the religions differ. Most of Christianity posits that God is the [[Trinity]]; in this view God exists as three distinct entities which share a single divine essence, or substance. In those three there is one, and in that one there are three; the one God is indivisible, while the three entities are distinct and unconfused, Abba God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  It teaches that God became especially immanent in physical form through the [[Incarnation]] of [[Jesus]], who is believed to be at once [[Hypostatic union|fully God and fully human]].  By contrast, Judaism sees God as a [[Divine simplicity|single entity]], and views trinitarianism as both incomprehensible and a violation of the Bible's teaching that God is one. It rejects the notion that Jesus or any other object or living being could be 'God', that God could have a literal 'son' in physical form or is divisible in any way, or that God could be made to be joined to the [[Nature|material world]] in such fashion.  Although Judaism provides Jews with a word to label God's transcendence (''[[Ein Sof]]'', without end) and immanence (''[[Shekhinah]]'', in-dwelling), but these are merely human words to describe two ways of experiencing God; God is one and indivisible.

Some Jewish and Christian philosophers hold that due to these differences, it may well be that Jews and Christians don't believe in the same god at all. The majority Jewish view, codified in [[halakha|Jewish law]], is that Christians do worship the same God that Jews do but with extras - called a 'Sheetoof' (combination). The vast majority of Christians have always held that they worship the same God as the Jews.

== Understanding of the Bible ==

Jews and Christians seek authority from many of the same basic books, but they conceive of these books in significantly different ways.

The [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] is comprised of three parts:
* [[Torah]] - the five books of Moses
* [[Nevi'im]] - the writings of the Prophets, and
* [[Ketuvim]] - other writings canonised over time, such as the Books of Esther, Jonah, Ruth or Job.
Collectively, these are known as the [[Tanakh]], a Hebrew acronym for the first letters of each.  Rabbinical Judaism traditionally believes that these written works were also accompanied by an oral tradition which taught how to perform commandments that are not stated explicitly in the Torah (i.e. what a [[Menorah]] looks like and what is meant by &quot;Frontlets&quot; in the [[Shema]]), and that it was revealed to [[Moses]] at Sinai and passed down through generations and eventually written down in the [[Talmud]] (see below).

Judaism accept as authoritative an [[oral law]] which explains the meaning and application of the laws in the Tanakh. These works of oral law are today collected in the [[Mishnah]], which was written down around 200 C.E., and a Babylonian and a Jerusalem [[Talmud]], which were edited around 600 C.E. and 450 C.E., respectively.

Since the transcription of the Talmud, notable rabbis have compiled law codes that are generally held in high regard: the [[Mishnah Torah]], the [[Tur]], and the [[Shulchan Aruch]], which is generally held to be authoritative by Orthodox Jews.  The [[Zohar]], which was written in the thirteenth century, is generally held as the most important mystical treatise of the Jews.

Within the Torah, Jews find [[613 Mitzvot]] (formal divine commandments), of which some are positive obligations, and others negatives that must be avoided. These form the basis of their understanding of the law. The in-depth examination to understand the commandments and their true significance and scope, to &quot;walk in My ways&quot;, forms a major thread within the Talmud and other Jewish writings.

For Jews, the Torah is one's primary guide to the relationship between God and man, a living document that has unfolded and will continue to unfold whole new insights over the generations and millennia. A saying that captures this goes, &quot;Turn it [the Torah's words] over and over again, for everything is in it.&quot;

Jews do not accept the characterization of their sacred texts as an [[Old Testament]], nor do they believe that the [[New Testament]] has religious authority. Many Jews see Christians as having quite an ambivalent view of the Torah (or the Mosaic Law part of the Old Testament as it is known to Christians), on the one hand it is God's absolute word, on the other hand at times [[Cafeteria Christianity|treating commandments very selectively]]. As it seems to some Jews, Christians cite from the Old Testament commandments to support one point of view but then ignore other commandments of a similar class which are also of equal weight. Examples of this are certain commandments where God states explicitly they shall abide &quot;for ever&quot;, or where God states a particular thing is an &quot;abomination&quot;, but which are not undertaken by most Christians. Some forms of Christianity even go so far as [[Antinomianism]].

Christians reject the Jewish oral law (Matt. 15:6). However in a similar way [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]] consider their [[Sacred Tradition]] as the correct interpretation, while [[Protestantism|Protestants]] hold to the principle of [[sola scriptura]]. Christians disagree with the Jewish order of sacred texts (and some Christian traditions have included in their [[Old Testament]] books that are not included in today's Jewish canon, although they were included in the Jewish [[Septuagint]]). Historically, the Jewish oral tradition was not written down until the period of the Roman Empire, in the early centuries CE([[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] [[Palestinian Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]) and later developed more thoroughly through codification.  Many Christians reject the covenant with God embodied in traditional Jewish scriptures and oral traditions as obsolete, and thus refer to their canon of Hebrew books as the &quot;[[Old Testament]].&quot;  Some Christians believe that God has established a [[New Covenant]] with people, and that this new covenant is established in an additional set of books collectively called the [[New Testament]], together with the oral teachings of Jesus to the Apostles which have been handed down to this day.

== Sin and Original Sin ==

In both religions, one's offenses against the will of God are called [[sin]] (in Christianity the full name is &quot;actual sin&quot;). These sins can be thoughts, words, or deeds. 

Catholicism categorizes sins into various groups. A wounding of the relationship with God is often called [[venial sin]]; a complete rupture of the relationship with God is often called [[mortal sin]].  Without salvation from sin (see below), a person's separation from God is permanent, causing such a person to enter [[Hell]] in the afterlife.  

[[Original Sin]] is a slightly different concept in Christianity, it is not part of Jewish belief or philosophy.  Original sin refers to the idea that the sin of [[Adam and Eve]]'s disobedience (sin &quot;at the origin&quot;) has passed on a spiritual heritage, so to speak. Christians teach that human beings inherit a corrupted or damaged human nature in which the tendency to do bad is greater than it would have been otherwise, so much so that human nature would not be capable now of participating in the afterlife with God. This is not a matter of being &quot;guilty&quot; of anything; each person is only personally guilty of their own actual sins.  However, this understanding of original sin is what lies behind the Christian emphasis on the need for spiritual salvation from a spiritual Saviour, who can forgive and set aside sin even though humans are not inherently pure and worthy of such salvation.  [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[1 Corinthians|First Corinthians]] placed special emphasis on this doctrine, and stressed that belief in Jesus would allow Christians to overcome death and attain salvation in the hereafter.   

[[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, and some [[Protestantism|Protestants]] teach the Sacrament of [[Baptism]] is the means by which each person's damaged human nature is healed and [[Sanctifying Grace]] (capacity to enjoy and participate in the spiritual life of God) is restored.  This is referred to as &quot;being born of water and the Spirit,&quot; following the terminology in the [[Gospel]] of St. John.  Most [[Protestantism|Protestants]] believe this salvific grace comes about at the moment of personal decision to follow Jesus, and that [[Baptism]] is a symbol of the grace already received.

The Hebrew word for sin, ''het'', literally means &quot;to go astray.&quot;  Just as Jewish law, ''halachah'' provides the proper &quot;way&quot; (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.  Judaism teaches that humans are born morally neutral and have free will.  Jews have no concept of Original Sin, and do not accept it; instead, Judaism affirms that people are born with a ''yetzer hatov'', (literally, &quot;the good inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and with a ''yetzer hara'', (literally &quot;the evil inclination&quot;, in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behaviour and a tendency to be selfish).  In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. There is almost always a &quot;way back&quot; if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, and the malicious person)

The rabbis recognize a positive value to the ''yetzer hara'': one tradition identifies it with God's observation on the last day of creation that His accomplishment was &quot;very good&quot; (God's work on the preceding days was just described as &quot;good&quot;) and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will. 

Or as Rabbi [[Hillel]] famously summarised the Jewish philosophy:
:''&quot;If I am not for myself, who will be for me?''
:''&quot;But if I am not for &lt;u&gt;others&lt;/u&gt; - what am I?''
:''&quot;And if not now [if I do not choose now], [then] when?''

Another explanation is, without the existence of the yetzer ha'ra, there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was &quot;good&quot; before, it became &quot;very good&quot; when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's &quot;mitzvot&quot; (wishes or commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.

Jews recognize two kinds of &quot;sin,&quot; offenses against other people, and offenses against God.  Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jews have believed that right action (as opposed to right belief) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. [[Midrash]] ''Avot de Rabbi Natan'' states the following:

:One time, when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was walking in [[Jerusalem]] with Rabbi Yehosua, they arrived at where the Temple now stood in ruins. &quot;Woe to us&quot; cried Rabbi Yehosua, &quot;for this house where atonement was made for Israel's sins now lies in ruins!&quot; Answered Rabban Yochanan, &quot;We have another, equally important source of atonement, the practice of ''gemilut hasadim'' (&quot;loving kindness&quot;), as it is stated &quot;I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice&quot; ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16160&amp;showrashi=true Hosea 6:6]).

The Babylonian [[Talmud]] states:
:Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests]. (Tractate Berachot, 55a.) 

The liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]) states that prayer, repentance and [[tzedakah]] (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word &quot;T'shuvah&quot; used for atonement actually means &quot;to return&quot;. Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.

== Faith versus good deeds ==

Judaism teaches that the purpose of the [[Torah]] is to show that good deeds are considered in holiness as much or even more important than belief in God, and that both are required of people. An old Jewish saying captures this sentiment, &quot;If you hear the Messiah has come, and you are doing a job, finish the job properly, then go and see.&quot; Although the Torah commands Jews to believe in God, Jews see belief in God as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a Jewish life. The quintessential verbal expression of Judaism is the [[Shema Yisrael]], the statement that the God of the Bible is their God, and that this God is unique and one. The quintessential physical expression of Judaism is behaving in accordance with the [[613 Mitzvot]] (the commandments specified in the Torah), and thus live one's life in God's ways. 

Thus fundamentally in Judaism, one is enjoined to bring holiness into life (with the guidance of Gods laws), rather than removing oneself from life to be holy.

Much of [[Christianity]] also teaches that God wants people to perform good works, but all branches hold that good works alone will not lead to salvation, which is called [[Legalism (theology)|Legalism]]. Some Christian denominations hold that salvation depends upon transformational faith in Jesus which expresses itself in good works as a testament (or witness) to ones faith for others to see (primarily [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity and [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholicism]]), while others (including most Protestants) hold that faith alone is necessary for salvation.  However, the difference is not as great as it seems, because it really hinges on the definition of &quot;faith&quot; used. The first group generally uses the term &quot;faith&quot; to mean &quot;intellectual and heartfelt assent and submission.&quot;  Such a faith will not be salvific until a person has allowed it to effect a life transforming conversion (turning towards God) in their being (see [[ontological faith]]).  The Christians that hold to &quot;salvation by faith alone&quot; (also called by its Latin name &quot;[[sola fide]]&quot;) define faith as being implicitly [[ontological]]--mere intellectual assent is not termed &quot;faith&quot; by these groups.  Faith, then, is life-transforming by definition.  

A practical outcome of this difference is the attitudes of the two religions to ''death bed conversions''. According to most forms of classical Christianity, one may lead an evil life, but on one's death one may repent for one's sins, accept Jesus as Christian dogma teaches, and then that person will be rewarded with a heavenly afterlife by God; this will be the same heavenly paradise that a comparatively less sinful person would receive. In contrast, all forms of Judaism teach that God judges a person based on their whole lifetime of actions and beliefs, and that deathbed conversions are therefore meaningless and have minimal effect on God's view of their life.

== Love ==
Love is a central value in both Judaism and Christianity.  In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'', literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] argues that their notions of love are fundamentally different.  Specifically, he links the Jewish conception of love to justice, and the Christian conception of love to charity.

As in English, the Hebrew word for &quot;love,&quot; [[ahavah]] אהבה, is used to describe intimate or romantic feelings or relationships, such as the love between parent and child in [[Genesis]] 22:2; 25: 28; 37:3; the love between close friends in [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 18:2, 20:17; or the love between a young man and young woman in [[Song of Songs]]. 

Like many Jewish scholars and theologians, Bloom understands Judaism as fundamentally a religion of love.  But he argues that one can understand the Hebrew conception of love only by looking at one of the core commandments of Judaism, [[Leviticus]] 19:18, &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;  This commandment is, arguably, at the center of the Jewish faith.  As the third book of the [[Torah]], Leviticus is literally the central book.  Historically, Jews have considered it of central importance: traditionally, children began their study of the Torah with Leviticus, and the [[midrash]]ic literature on Leviticus is among the longest and most detailed of midrashic literature (see Bamberger 1981: 737).  Bernard Bamberger considers Leviticus 19, beginning with God's commandment in verse 3 &amp;ndash; &quot;You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God, am holy&quot; &amp;ndash; to be &quot;the climactic chapter of the book, the one most often read and quoted&quot; (1981:889).  Leviticus 19:18 is itself the climax of this chapter.

As theologian [[Franz Rosenzweig]] has pointed out, &quot;love&quot; in this context is remarkably different from the more common examples of love in that it constitutes an impersonal relationship:
:...the neighbor is only a representative.  He is not loved for his own sake, nor for his beautiful eyes, but only because he just happens to be standing there, because he happens to be nighest to me.  Another could easily stand in his place &amp;mdash; precisely at this place nearest me.  The neighbor is the other ...
(This point is underscored by another verse in the same chapter, Leviticus 19: 34, commanding the Children of Israel to love strangers.)

According to Franz Rosenzweig, the commandment to love one's neighbor itself arises out of another unique love: the relationship between God and the [[Children of Israel]]. That the relationship between God and the Children of Israel is a romantic relationship and comparable to the marital bond is made clear in [[Hosea]] 2:19 (see also [[Ezekiel]] 16:8, 60; [[Isaiah]] 54:5; [[Jeremiah]] 3:14; 31:32).  The centrality of love to the relationship between God and Israel is epitomized in [[Deuteronomy]] 6: 4-5: &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.&quot;  Arguably, this commandment is as central to Judaism as as Leviticus 19: 18, as it was recited twice daily in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and in the prayers of all observant Jews.  Moreover, the Rabbis dictated that all Jews should recite this verse at the moment of their death (this custom contrasts with Mathew 27: 46, &quot;About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?' — which means, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; see also Mark 15: 33; Luke 23: 46, however, is closer to the spirit of Jewish practice: &quot;Jesus called out with a loud voice, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.' When he had said this, he breathed his last.&quot;)

Apparently by the Hellenistic period these two commandments were understood to be central to Jewish faith (see Mark 12: 28-32).  Rosenzweig believes that these two commandments to love are inextricably connected, but in a complex way.  He finds it remarkable that throughout the [[Torah]] God demands that Israel love Him, yet never professes love for Israel (except in the future; that if Israel loves God He will bless them in return).  But he does not see this as evidence that God does not love Israel; on the contrary.  Rosenzweig asks, how can someone command love?  The only answer, he argues, is that only a lover can do so; only one who loves can demand, &quot;love me!' in return (Rosenzweig 1970: 176-177).  The consequences of this demand, according to Rosenzweig, provide the foundation for Judaism.

The first consequence of being loved, according to Rosenzweig, is a feeling of shame:
:In the admission of love, the soul bares itself.  To admit that one requites love and in the future wants nothing but to be loved &amp;mdash; this is sweet.  But it is hard to admit that one was without love in the past.  And yet &amp;mdash; love would not be the moving, the gripping, the searing experience that it is if the moved, gripped, seared soul were not conscious of the fact that up to this moment it had not been moved or gripped.  Thus a shock was necessary before the self could become the beloved soul.  And the soul is ashamed of its former self, and that it did not, under its own power, break this spell in which it was confined.  This is the shame that blocks the beloved mouth that wishes to make acknowledgment.  The mouth has to acknowledge its past and still present weakness by wishing to acknowledge its already present and future bliss. (Rosenzweig 1970: 179)
Thus, the immediate response to God's commandment to love is to confess, &quot;I have sinned.&quot;  For Rosenzweig this confession is not a source of shame; on the contrary, by speaking a truth about the past, it makes love in the present possible and thus &quot;abolishes shame.&quot;  

Consequently, Rosenzwieg does not believe that this confession requires absolution:
:It is not God that need cleanse it [the soul of the beloved, i.e. Israel] of its sin.  Rather it cleanses itself in the presence of his love.  It is certain of God's love in the very moment that shame withdraws from it and it surrenders itself in free, present admission &amp;mdash; as certain as if God had spoken into its ear that &quot;I forgive&quot; which is longed for earlier when it confessed to him its sins of the past.  It no longer needs this formal absolution.  It is freed of its burden at the very moment of daring to assume all of it on its shoulders.  So too the beloved no longer needs the acknowledgment of the lover which she longed for before she admitted her love.  At the very moment when she herself dares to admit it, she is as certain of his love as if he were whispering his acknowledgment into her ear. (Rosenzweig 1970: 180-181)
In other words, Rosenzweig sees in the Hebrew Bible a &quot;grammar of love&quot; in which God can communicate &quot;I love you&quot; only by demanding &quot;You must love me,&quot; and Israel can communicate &quot;I love you&quot; only by confessing &quot;I have sinned.&quot;  Therefore, this confession does not lead God to offer an unnecessary absolution; it merely expresses Israel's love for God.  

But &quot;What then is God's answer to this 'I am thine' by which the beloved soul acknowledges him&quot; if it is not &quot;absolution?&quot;  Rosenzweig's answer is: revelation: &quot;He cannot make himself known to the soul before the soul has acknowledged him.  But now he must do so.  For this it is by which revelation first reaches completion.  In its groundless presentness, revelation must now permanently touch the ground.&quot; (Rosenzweig 1970: 182)  Revelation, epitomized by Sinai, is God's response to Israel's love.  Contrary to Paul, who argued that &quot;through the law comes knowledge of sin&quot; (Romans 3: 20), Rosenzweig argues that it is because of and after a confession of sin that God reveals to Israel knowledge of the law.

For Rosenzweig as for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]], [[Song of Songs]] provides a paradigm for understanding the love between God and Israel, a love that &quot;is strong as death&quot; (Song of Songs 8:6; Rosenzweig 1970: 202).  God's love is as strong as death because it is love for the People Israel, and it is as a collective that Israel returns God's love.  Thus, although one may die, God and Israel, and the love between them, lives on.  In other words, Song of Songs is &quot;the focal book of revelation&quot; (Rosenzweig 1970: 202) where the &quot;grammar of love&quot; is most clearly expressed. But, Rosenzweig argues, this love that is as strong as death ultimately transcends itself, as it takes the form of God's law &amp;mdash; for it is the law that binds Israel as a people, and through observance of the law that each Jew relives the moment of revelation at Mt. Sinai.  Ultimately, Song of Songs points back to Leviticus and the rest of the Torah.

Song of Songs largely describes a clandestine love affair, forbidden by the woman's brothers (Song of Songs 8: 8-9), and scorned by her friends (Song of Songs 5:9).  For Rosenzweig, the concealed nature of this romance is emblematic of the way lovers lose themselves in one another.  Yet the book itself struggles against this private love.  &quot;O that you were like a brother to me,&quot; the woman cries, &quot;that nursed at my mother's breast! If I met you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me&quot; (Song of Songs 8:1).  The point, for Rosenzweig, is that love neither can nor should remain private.
:Now she is his.  Is she?  Does not something ultimate still separate them at the pinncale of love &amp;mdash; beyond even that &quot;Thou art mine&quot; of the lover, beyond even that peace which the beloved found in his eyes, this last word of her overflowing heart?  Does there not still remain one last separation?  The lover has explained his love for her .... But will this explanation do?  Does not life demand more than explanation, more than the calling by name? Does it not demand reality?  And a sob escapes the blisfully overflowing heart of the beloved and forms into words, words which haltingly point to something unfulfilled, something which cannot be fuliflled in the immediate revelation of love: &quot;O that you were like a brother to me!&quot;  Not enough that the beloved lover calls his bride by the name of sister in the flickering twilight of allusion.  The name ought to be the truth.  It should be heard in the bright light of &quot;the street,&quot; not whispered into the beloved ear in the dusk of intimate duo-solitude, but in the eyes of the multitude, officially &amp;mdash; &quot;who would grant&quot; that! Yes, who would grant that?  Love no longer grants it.  In truth, this &quot;who would grant&quot; is no longer directed to the beloved lover.  Love after all always remains between two people; it knows only of I and Thou, not the street.  This longing cannot be fulfilled in love ... (Rosenzweig 1970: 203-204)
It cannot be fulfilled in love.  For Rosenzweig, as for the Rabbis, it can be fulfilled only in law.  This is the meaning of revelation: Israel's love for God provides Him with the means to enter the world, and through His commandments to Israel their love enters &quot;the street.&quot;  It is through the revelation of God's commandments, according to Rosenzweig, that the love portrayed in Song of Songs becomes the love commanded in Leviticus.  Just as God's love for the Children of Israel is one of the ways that he extends Himself into the world, the necessary response by the Jews &amp;mdash; the ''way'' to love God in return &amp;mdash; is to extend their own love out towards their fellow human beings. 

This extension of God's love into the world, through the People Israel, is the point of Leviticus 19:18.  According to Bloom, however, this love has a different character than the romantic love celebrated in Song of Songs.  He argues that to understand the commandment to love one's neighbor one must look at the other commandments that form its context, beginning with verse 9:

:When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap all the way to the edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest. You shall not pick your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger: I the Lord am your God. 

:You shall not steal; you shall not deal deceitfully or falsely with one another. You shall not swear falsely by My name, profaning the name of your God: I am the Lord.  

:You shall not defraud your neighbor.  You shall not commit robbery.  The wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until morning.  You shall not insult the deaf, or place a stumbling block before the blind.  You shall fear your God: I am the Lord. 

:You shall not render an unfair decision: do not favor the poor or show deference to the rich; judge your neighbor fairly.  Do not deal basely with your fellows.  Do not profit by the blood of your neighbor: I am the Lord.  

:You shall not hate your kinsman in your heart.  Reprove your neighbor, but incur no guilt because of him.  You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk.  Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.

According to Bloom these accompanying commandments reveal that for Israel, love &quot;in the street&quot; takes the form of &quot;just dealing.&quot; Similarly, theologian William Herberg argued that &quot;justice&quot; is at the heart of the Jewish notion of love, and the foundation for Jewish law: 
:The ultimate criterion of justice, as of everything else in human life, is the divine imperative &amp;mdash; the law of love .... Justice is the institutionalization of love in society .... This law of love requires that every man be treated as a Thou, a person, an end in himself, never merely as a thing or a means to another's end.  When this demand is translated into laws and institutions under the conditions of human life in history, justice arises. (1951: 148)

The arguments of Rosenzweig, Herberg, and Bloom echo the teachings of the [[Rabbinic Judaism|the Rabbis]], who taught that the written and oral [[Torah|Torahs]] provide the way to express this love-as-just-dealing.  This view is encapuslated in one of the most famous rabbinic stories, that of the time a man once challenged [[Hillel the Elder]], an important [[Pharisee]] who lived at the end of the 1st century BCE, to explain the entire law ([[Torah]]) while standing on one foot. Hillel replied, &quot;That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary. Go and study it.&quot;  Rosenzweig suggests that Hillel presented the commandment from Leviticus in the negative form (do not do it) as a way of setting up his own, affirmative, commandment: to go and study the law &amp;mdash; in other words, the only way to fulfil Leviticus 19:18 is to observe all the laws of the Torah, the practical embodiment of the commandment to love.  Similarly, [[Maimonides]] wrote that it should only be out of love for God, rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward, that Jews should obey the law: &quot;When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love&quot; (Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159).

Whereas Jews believe that law is the ultimate fulfilmeent of lova, Christians believe that love is &quot;the fulfillment of the Law&quot; (Romans 13:8-10).  Nevertheless, Jesus shared Hillel's &amp;mdash; and presumably many Jews' &amp;mdash; notion of love and the law, when he echoed the Phariseic position that 
:&quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.&quot; This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. (Matthew 22:37-40)

When asked in reference to the latter commandment &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot; (Luke 10:29), Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37), in which the answer to the question is ultimately a foreigner (perhaps echoing Leviticus 19: 34).

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus extended the commandment to include not only &quot;your neighbor&quot; but &quot;your enemy&quot; as well:
:&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your cloak also. Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the pagans do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. (Matthew 5:38-48)

Jesus lived out this teaching at the end of his life. During his arrest, trial, scourging, and crucifixion, Jesus offered no resistance, totally submitting to his persecutors, however unjust. During Jesus' arrest, one of his desciples struck with a sword the ear of a man coming to seize Jesus, but Jesus commanded him to put away the sword, and healed the ear. (Luke 22:50-51) Jesus even prayed for his persecutors from the cross, calling out &quot;Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do.&quot; (Luke 23:34)

Because of this, Jesus' selfless life of service, and the belief that Jesus died for the salvation of His people, Christian love is personified by Jesus, the supreme example being his martyrdom on the cross. Jesus commanded his desciples to follow his example: &quot;My command is this: Love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.&quot; (John 15:12-13) Furthermore, this same love is believed to be shared between the Father, the Son, and all Christians: &quot;Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love&quot; (John 15:9-10). Finally, Jesus proclaimed love to be the defining characteristic of all Christians: &quot;By this all men will know you are my desciples, if you love one another&quot; (John 13:35).

Still, even more remarkable statements about love are made in the New Testament by the apostle John and by Paul. The most famous, and widely considered one of the earliest and most succinct summaries of the Christian faith, runs &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but shall have eternal life&quot; (John 3:16). Adding to this is &quot;God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us&quot; (Romans 5:8).

In the first epistle of John, he makes the bold statement &quot;God is Love&quot; (1 John 4:8,16). So love is not merely ''a'' characteristic of God, but ''the'' characteristic, which alone sums up God's complete essence.

Bloom argues that the Hebrew word for love, [[ahavah]] אהבה , is fundamentally understood as &quot;just dealing.&quot; In the classic characterization of Christian love, Paul's discourse in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], sometimes called the &quot;love chapter,&quot; rather than using either of the two other Greek words that loosely translate to English as &quot;love&quot; ([[eros (love)|erōs]] ερως, meaning erotic love, or [[philos]] φιλος , meaning familial love), Paul used the word [[agape|agápē]] αγαπη, which is probably more literally translated as &quot;charity,&quot; and was first translated as &quot;love&quot; by [[William Tyndale]]:  

:If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. (1 Corinthians 13:1-8) ... And now these three remain: Faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13)

Taking all this into account, Christian love can generally be described as: unconditional, self-sacrificing, charitable, altruistic, selfless, service-oriented, obedient, humble, peaceful, and compassionate.

The Corinthians passage is not only remarkable for the quality of love it describes. The intent of the passage is clearly to elevate love above other things traditionally considered good, including wisdom, faith, and charitable giving. It also explicitly makes love more important than the things mentioned in the previous passage: supernatural gifts, spiritual strength and positions of leadership. Many assert that this this, combined with Jesus' teachings and John's claims, expands Christian love beyond that in Leviticus. Bloom maintains that the difference is in the character of love.

To summarize, both Judaism and Christianity hold Leviticus 19:18 most sacred. Judaism understands this as &quot;Deal justly with whomever you meet.&quot; Christianity understands this as &quot;Give selflessly to all.&quot;

== Abortion ==

Both Jews and Christians regard pregnancy as a gift from God, and hold children to be miracles.

The only statements in the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, Christian Old Testament) about the status of a fetus state that killing an unborn infant does not have the same status as killing a born human being, and mandates a much lesser penalty (a fine); it should be added that the instance cited in the Tanakh contemplates the accidental, rather than the deliberate, causing of an abortion.

The [[Talmud|Oral Law]] states that the fetus is not yet a full human being until it has been born (either the head or the body is mostly outside of the mother), therefore killing a fetus is not murder, and [[abortion]] - in restricted circumstances - has always been legal under Jewish law. [[Rashi]], the great 12th century commentator on the Bible and Talmud, states clearly of the fetus 'lav nefesh hu--it is not a person.' The Talmud contains the expression 'ubar yerech imo--the fetus is as the thigh of its mother,' i.e., the fetus is deemed to be part and parcel of the pregnant woman's body.&quot; Judaism prefers that such abortions, when necessary, take place before the first 40 days where the Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 69b states that: &quot;the embryo is considered to be mere water until the fortieth day.&quot; Afterwards, it is considered subhuman until it is born. Christians who agree with these views may refer to this idea as abortion before the &quot;quickening&quot; of the soul by God in the fetus.

There are two additional passages in the Talmud which shed some light on the Jewish belief about abortion. They imply that the fetus is considered part of the mother, and not a separate entity:

*One section states that if a man purchases a cow that is found to be pregnant, then he is the owner both of the cow and the fetus. 
*Another section states that if a pregnant woman converts to Judaism, that her conversion applies also to her fetus.

Judaism unilaterally supports, in fact mandates, abortion if doctors believe that it is necessary to save the life of the mother.  Many rabbinic authorities allow abortions on the grounds of gross genetic imperfections of the fetus, such as [[Tay-Sachs disease]]. They also allow abortion if the mother were suicidal because of such defects.  However, Judaism holds that abortion is impermissible for family planning or convenience reasons. Each case must be decided individually, however, and the decision should lie with the mother, father, and Rabbi.

Most branches of Christianity have historically held abortion to be generally wrong, referring to [[Old Testament]] passages such as Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1, as well as [[New Testament]] passages concerning both Jesus and [[John the Baptist]] while they were ''in utero''. Also, the [[Didache]], an early Church document, explicitly forbids abortion along with [[infanticide]], both common practices in the [[Roman Empire]], as murder. The view that abortion is 'equivalent to murder' is not actually widely held outside fundamentalist Protestantism in the United States. The Roman Catholic church, for example, permits medical procedures to be carried out on a mother for the purpose of saving her life, even if doing so would put the foetus at risk. Many Protestant Christians claim that the [[Ten Commandments]] prohibit abortion under the heading of &quot;Do not murder&quot;. Others reject this view, as they hold that the context of the entire set of Biblical laws includes those laws which restrict them to already born human beings.

== War, violence and pacifism ==

Jews and Christians accept as valid and binding many of the same moral principles taught in the [[Torah]]. There is a great deal of overlap between the ethical systems of these two faiths. Nonetheless, there are some highly significant doctrinal differences.

Judaism has a great many teachings about peace and compromise, and its teachings make physical violence the last possible option. Nonetheless, the [[Talmud]] teaches that &quot;If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense [rather than be killed]&quot;. The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and it would also be considered helping a murderer kill someone and &quot;placing an obstacle in front of a blind man&quot; (making it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with peace, and the obligation to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people. 

Under extreme circumstances, although killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, Jews have committed [[suicide]] or mass suicide as a final resort, with religious approval, when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First Persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples). As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for &quot;when the knife is at the throat&quot;, for those dying &quot;to sanctify God's Name&quot;. (See: ''[[Martyrdom]]'')

Because Judaism focusses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic [[morality|moral]] [[dilemma]] of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analysed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.

The [[Sermon on the Mount]] records that Jesus taught that if someone comes to harm you, then one must [[turn the other cheek]].  This has led four fairly sizable Protestant Christian denominations to develop a theology of [[pacifism]], the avoidance of force and violence at all times. They are known historically as the ''[[peace churches]]'', and have incorporated Christ's teachings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolence]] into their theology so as to apply it to participation in the use of violent force; those denominations are the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and the [[Church of the Brethren]]. Many other churches have people who hold to the doctrine without making it a part of their doctrines, or who apply it to individuals but not to governments. The vast majority of Christian nations and groups have not adopted this theology, nor have they followed it in practice.

==Judgement==

Both Christianity and Judaism believe in some form of judgement.

The Christian view is very well defined - every human is a sinner, and nothing but being saved by God's grace (and not through any merit of ones own actions) can change the damnatory sentence to salvation. There is a [[Last Judgment|judgement after death]], and Christ will return to judge the living and dead. Those positively judged will be saved and live in God's presence in heaven, those who are negatively judged will be cast to eternal hell (or in some versions, annihilated).

Jewish teaching is somewhat ambivalent on Judgement. Initially indeed there was no such concept in Judaism, however over time, and especially as exposed to other cultures' concept that every wrong must be somehow balanced by punishment in the end, and vice versa, a mixture of concepts and philosophies entered Judaism.  At heart though, Jews do not look for an afterlife as a reward or motivation. The reward for a good life is simply the pleasure it gives God, and the rightness of doing ones duty and living a holy life in his ways. Little emphasis is given in Jewish life to the struggle for a place in the afterlife.

That said, in Jewish liturgy there is significant prayer and talk of a &quot;book of life&quot; that one is written into, a metaphorical allusion that God judges each person each year and possibly after death. Many Jewish sages understand this to be metaphorical. For example - one Day of Atonement prayer says it will be decided ''&quot;who will be made strong, and who weak, who will have good health, who poor, who will be at peace and who not at peace... but prayer pentitence and charity avert a stern decree&quot;''. However others translate this to mean, by ones decisions to change oneself (or otherwise), it will become inevitable who will do good and create peace in the coming year, and who will do ill and create lack of peace, and so on.

==Capital punishment==

Although the Jewish bible has many references to capital punishment, in fact very early on, the Jewish sages and rabbis used their authority, and the demands for [[justice]] emphasized in the bible, to make it all but impossible for a Jewish court to impose a death sentence. Even when such a sentence might have been imposed, the &quot;cities of refuge&quot; and other sanctuaries, were at hand for those [[manslaughter|unintentionally guilty]] of capital offences.

In this manner, the Talmud seriously limits the use of the death penalty to only be applicable to those criminals who were warned not to commit a capital crime in the presence of two witnesses, and persisted in committing the crime also in front of at least two witnesses. It was said in the Talmud about the death penalty in Judaism, that if a court killed one person in seventy years, it was a barbarous (or &quot;bloody&quot;) court and should be condemned as such.

Although many people have died as a result of Christian actions, such as the [[crusade]]s, these were not capital punishment as such. In fact, Christianity has usually reserved the death penalty for [[heresy]], the denial of the orthodox view of God's view, and [[witchcraft]] or similar non-Christian practices, which struck at the roots of Christianity as practiced. For example, in [[Spain]], unrepentant Jews were exiled, and it was only those [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] who had accepted [[baptism]] under pressure but retained Jewish customs in private, who were punished in this way. 

At a time when belief in a literal judgement and eternal hell was widespread, capital punishment in this sense was seen as appropriate for two reasons:
:* It kept the faith pure and removed harmful influences that might corrupt or mislead others.
:* It was considered better that a person confessed (by torture if necessary), and was punished and suffered briefly on earth, than that they were punished by eternal damnation in the life after.

== Heaven and Hell ==
Judaism is largely unconcerned with the problem of death or an afterlife; the Biblical book of [[Ecclesiastes]] states that death is final; the place of the dead is called ''sheol,'' which means &quot;the grave.&quot;  Aside from the ghostly apparition of Samuel, called up by a witch at King Saul's command, the Hebrew Bible does not mention an afterlife.  According to critical scholars, Biblical Jews first believed that God always punished evil, but always during a person's life &amp;mdash; or, if the person is repentant, in the life of one of that persons' descendants.  Towards the end of the Biblical period, Jews began questioning whether God's punishments and rewards were always executed during a person's life.  A belief in an afterlife only developed in the Second Temple period, but was contested by various Jewish sects.  The [[Pharisees]] believed that upon death people rested in their graves until they would be physically resurrected with the coming of the messiah (in other words, they did not believe in an eternal soul independent of the body).  The [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] adopted this as a core belief, and it is the thirteenth of [[Maimonides|Maimonides']] [[Jewish principles of faith|Thirteen Principles of Faith]].

There is very little Jewish literature on heaven or hell as human destinations.  &quot;Heaven&quot; typically refers to a place where God debates [[Talmuds|Talmudic laws]] with the angels; &quot;hell,&quot; in Hebrew [[Gehenna]], refers to the Valley of Hinnom, southwest of [[Jerusalem]], abhorrent to Jews who believed that it used to be the place where children were sacrificed to [[Moloch]]; in Biblical times it was a garbage dump, and the place to which the [[scapegoat]] was sent on [[Yom Kippur]].

Jewish depictions of heaven as a place where humans go upon death are few, and depict it as a place where Jews spend eternity studying the Written and Oral [[Torah]].

Jewish depictions of hell as a place humans go upon death are even fewer.  According to most depictions, upon death, Jews who have sinned spend twelve miserable months in ''gehenna'' before going to heaven, although some accounts suggest that certain classes of sinners never go to heaven.

In short, Judaism does not have a notion of hell as a place ruled by Satan (God's dominion is total, and Satan is but one of God's angels), and does not have a notion of eternal damnation. The reason sinful Jews spend eleven months in ''gehenna'' is not so much a form of punishment but rather a period of purification necessary before entering heaven, or before being physically resurrected in the Messianic Age.  

Christians in general hold that [[Hell]] is a fiery place of torment that never ceases.  A small minority believe it is not permanent and that those who go there will eventualy be extinguished. Those who hold that it never ceases also believe that those who die go directly to [[Heaven]] or hell, whereas those who see it as transitory believe that the dead are unconscious until the judgment day after which some inherit immortality and live on the restored earth (paradise) and reprobates go for a period of torment in hell. 

Many Christians see heaven and hell as rewards and punishments necessary to motivate good and bad behavior.  Although the [[Pharisees]] and [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] believed that good people would be rewarded in a &quot;world to come,&quot; the notion that this promise should motivate good behavior is anathema in Judaism.  Thus, [[Maimonides]] wrote:
:A man should not say: I shall carry out the precepts of the Torah and study her wisdom in order to receive all the blessings written therein or in order to merit the life of the World to Come and I shall keep away from the sins forbidden by the Torah in order to be spared the curses mentioned in the Torah or in order not to be cut off from the life of the World to Come.  It is not proper to serve God in this fashion.  For one sho serves thus serves out of fear.  Such as way is not that of the prophets and sages.  Only the ignorant, and the women and children serve god in this way.  These are trained to serve out of fear until they obtain sufficient knowledge to serve out of love.  One who serves God out of love studies the Torah and practices the precepts and walks in the way of wisdom for no ulterior motive at all, neither out of fear of evil nor in order to acquire the good, but follows the truth because it is true and the good will follow the merit of attaining to it.  It is the stage of Abraham our father whom the Holy One, blessed be He, called &quot;My friend&quot; ([[Isaiah]] 41:8 &amp;ndash; ''ohavi'' = the one who loves me) because he served out of love alone.  It is regarding this stage that the Holy One, Blessed be He, commanded us through Moses, as it is said: &quot;You shall love the Lord your God&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5).  When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love.
(Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159)

== The Messiah ==

Jews believe that a descendant of King [[David]] will one day appear to restore the Kingdom of [[Israel]]. Jews refer to this person as [[Jewish eschatology|Moshiach]], translated as [[messiah]] in English and [[messiah|Christos]] in Greek.  The Hebrew word 'moshiach' (messiah) means 'anointed one,' and refers to a mortal human being.  The ''moshiach'' is held to be a human being who will be a descendant of [[King David]], and who will usher in an era of peace, prosperity, and spiritual understanding for Israel and all the nations of the world. The traditional Jewish understanding of the messiah is fully human, born of human parents, without any supernatural element, and is best elucidated by [[Maimonides]] (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon), in his commentary on the [[Talmud]]. The messiah is expected to have a relationship with God similar to that of the [[Nevi'im|prophets]] of the [[Tanakh]]. In brief, he holds that the job description, as such, is this: 

:All of the people Israel will come back to Torah; The people of Israel with be gathered back to the land of Israel; The [[Temple in Jerusalem]] will be rebuilt; Israel will live among the nations as an equal, and will be strong enough to defend herself; Eventually, war, hatred and famine will end, and an era of peace and prosperity will come upon the Earth. 

He adds:
:&quot;And if a king shall stand up from among the House of David, studying Torah and indulging in commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will coerce all Israel to follow it and to strengthen its weak points, and will fight The Lord's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded [and won all nations surrounding him. Old prints and mss.] and built a Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the strayed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together ... But if he did not succeed until now, or if he was killed, it becomes known that he is not this one of whom the Torah had promised us, and he is indeed like all [other] proper and wholesome kings of the House of David who died.&quot;

He also clarified the nature of the Messiah:
:&quot;Do not imagine that the anointed King must perform miracles and signs and create new things in the world or resurrect the dead and so on. The matter is not so: For [[Rabbi Akiba]] was a great scholar of the sages of the [[Mishnah]], and he was the assistant-warrior of the king Ben Coziba &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Simon bar Kokhba]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ... He and all the Sages of his generation deemed him the anointed king, until he was killed by sins; only since he was killed, they knew that he was not. The Sages asked him neither a miracle nor a sign...&quot;  (Main article: ''[[Moshiach]]'')

The Christian view of Jesus goes beyond such claims. Although Jews and Christians both refer to biblical prophecies concerning the coming of the messiah, they interpret them differently. For Christians, the messiah, Jesus Christ, is fully human and fully divine. In this view, Jesus offers salvation to all humans by his self-sacrifice. He is the divine [[Logos|Word of God]] who clothes himself in our humanity, so that human beings can be participants in divine life. Jesus sits in heaven at the right hand of God and will judge humanity by his very presence in the [[end of days]]. The liberation and peace brought by the messiah, in Christian terms, is primarily the result of his manifesting the truth of God in all spheres of life. Prophetic references to the future glory of Jerusalem are not interpreted in merely political or geographical terms, but as indications of the restoration of all creation that his unveiled presence will bring about.

Christian readings of the Hebrew Bible find hundreds of references to Jesus. This takes the form in some cases of specific prophesy, but in most cases of foreshadowing by types or forerunners.  Traditionally, most Christian readings of the Bible maintained that almost every prophecy was actually about the coming of Jesus, if read corectly. In other words, Christianity traditionally has taught that the entire Old Testament of the Bible was a prophecy about the coming of Jesus.

To learn more about the differences between these two concepts, see [[messiah]], [[Jewish messiah]], and [[Jesus]].

=== Catholic views ===

[[Catholicism]] traditionally taught that &quot;[[Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus|there is no salvation outside the Church]]&quot;, which some, particularly [[Feenyism|Fr. Feeney]] in the 19th century, interpreted as saying only Catholics can be saved.  However, the Catholic Church's position is a bit more nuanced than that.  The Catholic Church teaches that God's intended way of saving the human race is through the Catholic Church, and there is no source of saving grace which is not already contained within the Church.  It should be noted that in this sense, ''any'' church founded on Peter's rock, may properly be called a &quot;Catholic&quot; Church - Roman Catholic is but one of these though the largest. At the same time, it does not deny the possibility that those not visibly members of the Church may attain salvation as well. Jesus is the path of salvation, and whilst some know they are on that path others can travel the same Way without knowing the name of the street they are on.  In recent times, this teaching has been most notably expressed in the encyclicals [[Singulari Quidem]] (1856), [[Quanto Conficiamur Moerore]] (1863) and [[Dominus Iesus]] (2000). The latter document has taken criticism for claiming that non-Christians are in a &quot;gravely deficient situation&quot; as compared to Catholics.

[[Pope John Paul II]] on [[October 2]] of 2000 emphasized that this document did not say that non-Christians were actively denied salvation: &quot;...this confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united&quot;.  The Pope then, on [[December 6]], issued a statement to further emphasize that the Church continued to support its traditional stance that salvation was available to believers of other faiths: &quot;The gospel teaches us that those who live in accordance with the [[Beatitudes]]--the poor in spirit, the pure of heart, those who bear lovingly the sufferings of life--will enter God's kingdom.&quot; He further added, &quot;All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church, contribute under the influence of Grace to the building of this Kingdom.&quot;  On [[August 13]], [[2002]], [[United States|American]] Catholic bishops issued a joint statement with leaders of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]], called &quot;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&quot;, which affirmed that Christians should not target Jews for conversion.  The document stated: &quot;Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God&quot; and &quot;Jews are also called by God to prepare the world for God's Kingdom.&quot; However, some [[United States|U.S.]]-led [[Baptist]] and other [[Christian fundamentalist|fundamentalist]] denominations still believe it is their duty to engage in what they refer to as outreach to &quot;unbelieving&quot; Jews (see [[Jews for Jesus]]).

=== Eastern Orthodox views ===

Eastern Orthodox Christianity emphasizes a continuing life of repentance or ''metanoia'', which includes an increasing improvement in thought, belief and action. Regarding the salvation of Jews, [[Muslims]], and other non-Christians, the Orthodox have traditionally taught the same as the Catholic Church: that there is no salvation outside the church. People of all genders, races, economic and social positions, and so forth are welcome in the church. People of any religion are welcome to convert. Orthodoxy recognizes that other religions may contain truth, to the extent that they are in agreement with Christianity. (Some of the early church fathers pointed to [[Socrates]]' belief in one God; a few more modern Orthodox Christian theologians have found traces of trinitarianism in the writings of [[Laozi]].)

Many Orthodox theologians believe that all people will have an opportunity to embrace union with God, including Jesus, after their death, and so become part of the Church at that time. God is thought to be good, just, and merciful; it would not seem just to condemn someone because they never heard the Gospel message, or were taught a distorted version of the [[Gospel]] by [[heretics]]. Therefore, the reasoning goes, they must at some point have an opportunity to make a genuine informed decision. Ultimately, those who persist in rejecting God condemn themselves, by cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of all Life, and from the God who is Love embodied. Jews, Muslims, and members of other faiths, then, are expected to convert to Christianity in the afterlife. [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also holds this belief, and holds baptismal services in which righteous people are baptized in behalf of their ancestors who, it is believed, are given the opportunity to accept the ordinance.

=== Jewish views ===

Judaism holds that whatever salvation may exist is found only through good works and heartfelt [[prayer]]. The majority of Jewish works on this subject hold that one's faith or beliefs alone play a minimal role. However, for a contrary Jewish position see [[Maimonides]]'s [[Guide for the Perplexed]], which limits the afterlife only to people who attain a relatively high level of intellectual perfection, thereby allowing the active intellect to be made eternal through God.

Judaism teaches that all gentiles can receive a share in [[Jewish eschatology|&quot;the world to come&quot;]].  This is codified in the Mishna Avot 4:29, the Babylonian [[Talmud]] in tractates Avodah Zarah 10b, and Ketubot 111b, and in [[Maimonides]]'s 12th century law code, the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', in ''Hilkhot Melachim'' (Laws of Kings) 8.11.

Judaism has no strong tradition of offenses being punished by eternal damnation (the Hebrew Bible itself has very few references to any afterlife, and the word [[Sheol]] that is often translated as &quot;Hell&quot; is as often as not simply translated as &quot;the grave&quot;).  Some violations (e.g. suicide) would be punished by separation from the community (e.g. not being buried in a Jewish cemetery).

Judaism's view is summed up by a biblical observation about the [[Torah]]: in the beginning God clothes the naked (Adam), and at the end God buries the dead (Moses). The Children of Israel mourned for 40 days - then got on with their lives. No reference is made in the Torah to anything beyond, and this is true even for Moses of whom it is said &quot;nobody has arisen like him, who knew God face to face&quot;.

The Biblical conception of God is that his covenant is with the Jewish people, not individual Jews.  In the context of this covenant, the death of individual Jews is inconsequential and various older Biblical passages suggest that individual death is final.  It is the continued existence of the Jewish nation that is emphasized and the way that a human life should be led.  With the rise of [[Hellenistic]] (Greco-Roman) thinking, and later the rise of Christianity, Jews became more concerned with the problem of individual death and an afterlife. The Pharisees, and then the Rabbis, made it an essential element of their faith that upon the arrival of the messiah the dead shall be resurrected.  This is still a central belief in Orthodox Judaism and to a lesser extent in other branches of Judaism.  Some Christian thinkers have opined that a crucial difference between Jewish and Christian beliefs is that Jews believe it is the body that is resurrected.  The &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; has no life or meaning independent of a living body. However, Jewish scholars and theologians point to the many aspects of Judaism that affect the &quot;eternal soul&quot; and &quot;the world to come,&quot; indicating that the notion of an afterlife and the concept of post-death award and punishment is indeed deeply ingrained within the Jewish religion.

==Evangelism==

Judaism is not an evangelistic religion. Orthodox Judaism in fact deliberately makes it very difficult to convert and become a Jew, and requires a significant and full-time effort in living, study, righteousness, and conduct over several years. The final decision is by no means a foregone conclusion. A person cannot become Jewish by marrying a Jew, or by joining a synagogue, nor by any degree of involvement in the community or religion, but only by explicitly undertaking (under supervision) a formal and intense work over years aimed towards that goal. Some less strict versions of Judaism have made this process somewhat easier but it is still far from common.

In the distant past Judaism was more evangelistic, but this was still more akin just to &quot;greater openness to converts&quot; (c.f. [[Ruth]]) rather than active soliciting of conversions. Since Jews believe that one need not be a Jew to approach God, there is no religious pressure to convert non-Jews to their faith. See also [[proselyte]].

By contrast, Christianity is an explicitly [[evangelism|evangelical]] religion. Christians are commanded by Jesus to [[Great Commission|&quot;go forth and Baptize all nations&quot;]].  At some times and in certain places joyful evangelism has veered into high-pressure coercion, resulting in at best significant ill-will and at worst human rights abuse.  

This is broadly in line with the distinction made elsewhere that Jewish conversion is more like adoption into a tribe, nation or people, Christian conversion more like a declaration of personal faith.

==Miscellaneous==

* Jews believe that the number [[Number of the Beast (numerology)|666]] is holy and mystical, rather than evil.
* Jews do not believe that deceased [[Saints]] have any power or that they do anything (like miracles) in this world. Nor do they pray to them. At most Jews may go to a [[Tzadik|Tzadik's]] grave to ask one to interceed in heaven on their behalf, but any result is always from God, and the request is not a prayer.

==Mutual views==

In addition to each having varied views on the other as a religion, there has also been a long and often painful [[Christianity and anti-Semitism|history]] of conflict, persecution and at times, reconciliation, between the two religions, which have influenced their mutual views of their relationship over time.

[[Persecution]], [[genocide]] and forcible [[conversion]] of Jews (ie [[hate crime]]) were common for many centuries, with occasional gestures to reconciliation from time to time. [[Pogroms]] were common throughout Christian Europe, including organized violence, restrictive land ownership and professional lives, forcible relocation and [[ghetto]]ization, mandatory dress codes, and at times humiliating actions and [[torture]]. All had major effects on Jewish cultures. 

More recently, even within the last century alone, some Jews remember the [[Holocaust]] and the current wave of [[evangelism]] as yet more reasons to doubt goodwill, while others look to the many peaceful gestures towards harmony since that time, likewise some Christians are at peace and others suspicious of Jews. 

What is clear is that formally, there is mostly peaceful living side by side, with strong inter-dialogue at many levels to [[Christian-Jewish reconciliation|reconcile]] past differences between the two groups, and many Christians emphasize common historical heritage and religious continuity with the ancient spiritual lineage of the Jews. What is also likely is that for a long time to come, some within each will continue to consider the other with varying degrees of suspicion and hostility.

===Common Jewish views of Christianity===

:''Main article: [[Jewish view of Jesus]]''

Jesus plays no role whatsoever in Judaism. Jews are familiar with Jesus only due to their being immersed in a Christian-oriented society. Most Jews believe that Jesus was a real person. Many view him as just one in a long list of failed Jewish claimants to be the messiah, none of whom fulfilled the [[Jewish view of Jesus#Prophets|tests]] of a prophet specified in the Five Books of Moses. Others see Jesus as a teacher who worked with the gentiles and ascribe the messianic claims they find objectionable to his later followers. Because much physical and spiritual violence was done to Jews in the name of Jesus and his followers, and because evangelism is still an active aspect of many church's activities, many religious Jews are uncomfortable with discussing Jesus and treat him as a [[non-person]]. Finally, to still others, perhaps to most Jews, Jesus is simply irrelevant, a central figure in a religion that isn't theirs, much as [[Muhammad]] might seem to many Christians.

On a religious level, Judaism does not believe that God requires the sacrifice of any human. This is emphasized in medieval Jewish traditions concerning the story of the [[Binding of Isaac|Akedah]], the binding of [[Isaac]]. In the Jewish explanation, this is a story whereby God wanted to test Abraham's faith and willingness, and Isaac was never going to be actually sacrificed. Thus, Judaism rejects the notion that anyone can or should die for anyone else's sin. As a religion, Judaism is far more focused on the practicalities of understanding how one may live a sacred life in this world according to God's will, rather than hope of spiritual salvation in a future one. Judaism does not believe in the Christian concept of [[Hell]], nor that only those following one specific faith can be &quot;saved&quot;. Judaism does have a punishment stage in the afterlife (i.e. [[Gehenna]], a one year maximum purgatory) as well as a Heaven ([[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba .28the world to come.29|Gan Eden]]), but the religion does not intend it as a focus.

[[Christmas]] and other Christian festivals have no religious significance in Judaism and are not celebrated. Celebration of non-Jewish holy days is considered [[Avodah Zarah]] or &quot;Foreign Worship&quot; and is forbidden; however some secular Jews in the West treat Christmas as a secular (but not religious) holiday.

===Common Christian views of Judaism===

:''Main article:  [[Christianity]]''

In general, Christians view Christianity as the fulfilment and successor of Judaism, and Christianity initially carried forward (and still does albeit in slightly modified form) much of the doctrine and many of the practices from that faith, including [[monotheism]], the belief in a [[Messiah]], and certain forms of worship (such as [[prayer]], and reading from religious texts). Other beliefs around original sin atoned for by God giving his son, or the Son (who is God) coming down to earth for the sake of humanity, and a subsequent sacrifice of that Son, and the belief in the triune nature of God, are essential differences introduced in Christianity that have no counterpart in Judaism. 

Christians consider that the Law was necessary as an intermediate stage, but once the world was able to understand the significance of the Crucifixion, then [[Antinomianism|adherence to Law was superseded]] by faith in Christ as the path to God, and that many of the laws in the Old Testament (the Jewish Five Books of Moses) are no longer required to be applied in life, since humanity is now able to understand and be saved by Jesus directly.

Many Christians today hold to [[supersessionism]], the belief that the Jews' chosenness found its ultimate fulfillment through the message of Jesus: Jews who remain non-Christian are no longer considered to be chosen, since they reject Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God. This position has been softened or even completely abrogated by some churches where Jews are recognized to have a special status due to their covenant with God, so that this continues to be an area of on-going dispute among Christians. 

Some forms of Christianity which view the Jewish people as close to God, seek to understand and incorporate elements of Jewish understanding or perspective into their Christian beliefs as a means to respect their &quot;parent&quot; religion or to more fully seek out and return to their Christian roots. (Sometimes known as ''[[Judaizers]]'' because of the Judaic roots they seek to learn from). More evangelistic Christians tend to see Jews as essentially misguided by not choosing Christ, and as a people whom there is a more specific duty to evangelise or convert.

'''Cesare Borgia'''  ([[September]], [[1475]] &amp;ndash; [[March 12]], [[1507]]), [[Duke of Valentinois]], the illegitimate son of [[Pope Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia) and [[Vannozza dei Cattani]]. He was older brother to [[Lucrezia Borgia]].

Cesare was born to the mistress of Rodrigo Borgia, an important cardinal and nephew of [[Pope Calixtus III]].  Borgia planned to use the forces of the papacy to further his own family.  After years of scheming, Rodrigo had himself elected Pope in [[1492]].

Cesare was initially groomed by his father for a Church career and was elevated by his father to the rank of [[Catholic Cardinal|Cardinal]] by the age of 22.  Alexander VI staked the hopes for the Borgia family on Cesare's brother Juan, who was made captain general of the military forces of the papacy.  When Juan was assassinated, Alexander was forced to substitute Cesare, despite the fact that this conflicted with Cesare's vows.

Cesare's career was founded entirely upon his father's ability to distribute patronage.  Appointed commander of the papal armies, Cesare was sent by his father to subdue the cities of [[Romagna]] in central [[Italy]]. Though in theory subject directly to the pope, the rulers of these cities had been practically independent or dependent on other states for generations.  Alexander VI hoped that by subduing them his son would create a new central Italian kingdom that would rival [[Naples]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]] and [[Venice]].  

Cesare Borgia briefly employed [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as military architect and engineer at one point.  Leonardo had worked at the Milanese court of [[Ludovico Sforza]] for many years, until [[Charles VIII of France]] drove Sforza out of Italy.

Though an immensely capable general and statesman, Cesare could do nothing without continued papal patronage.  The death of his father ended his own career.  Gravely ill at the time that his father died in [[1503]], his political enemies, led by [[Pope Julius II]], were able to seize and imprison him. Exiled to [[Spain]], in [[1504]], he escaped from a Spanish prison two years later and joined his brother-in-law, King [[John III of Navarre|Jean d'Albret of Navarre]].  Serving [[Navarre]] as a soldier, he died at the [[siege]] of [[Viana, Spain|Viana]] in [[1507]], at the age of thirty-one. 

Cesare Borgia was greatly admired by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], who knew him personally.  Machiavelli used many of his exploits and tactics as examples in ''[[The Prince]]''.  A few scholars, however, have argued that Machiavelli's praise for Borgia was a parody, to cover up the actual anti-hero of the work, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].

It has been suggested that some pictures of Jesus Christ produced around Borgia's lifetime were based on Cesare Borgia, and that this in turn has influenced images of Jesus produced since that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally a '''chronicle''' ([[Latin]] ''chronica'') is historical
account of facts and events in [[chronology|chronological]] order. Typically equal weight is given for important events and less important events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which focuses on important events and excludes those the author does not see as important. 

[[Image:nabonidus chronicle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|  [[Nabonidus Chronicle]], [[British Museum]], London]]

Scholars categorize the [[genre]] of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A ''dead'' chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A ''live'' chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, [[historian]]s tend to value live chronicles over dead ones.

The term often refers to a [[book]] written by a chronicler in the [[Middle Ages]] describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also  applied to a record of public events. Various contemporary [[newspaper]]s or other 
[[periodical]]s have adopted &quot;chronicle&quot; as part of their name. Various [[fictional]] stories have also adopted &quot;chronicle&quot; as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''colonization of Africa''' has a long history, the most famous phase being the European [[Scramble for Africa]] of the [[nineteenth century]].

==Ancient Colonization==
[[North Africa]] in particular experienced colonization from [[Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]] in the early historical period.

The city of [[Carthage]] was established in what is now [[Tunisia]] by [[Phoenicia]]n colonists, becoming a major power in the [[Mediterranean]] by the [[4th century BC]]. Over time the city changed hands, falling to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s after the [[Third Punic War]], where it served as the capital city of the Romans' African province. Gothic [[Vandals]] briefly established a kingdom there in the [[5th century]], which shortly thereafter fell to the Romans again, this time the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilization also fell under the sway of the [[Hellenic civilization|Greeks]], later passing to the Romans. The whole of Roman/Byzantine North Africa eventually fell to the [[Arab]]s in the [[7th century]], who brought the [[Islam]]ic religion and [[Arabic language]] (see [[History of Islam]]).

==Early modern period==
From the seventh century, Arab trade with sub-Saharan Africa led to a gradual colonization of [[East Africa]], around [[Zanzibar]] and other bases.  Although [[trans-Saharan trade]] led to a small number of [[West Africa]]n cities developing Arab quarters, these were not intended as colonies and even the pillage of the [[Moroccan war]] in the Sahel finished with [[Morocco|Moroccan]] forces returning home.

Early European expeditions concentrated on colonizing previously uninhabited islands such as the [[Cape Verde]]s and [[Sao Tome Island]], or establishing coastal [[fort]]s as a base for trade.  These forts often developed areas of influence along coastal strips, but (with the exception of the [[River Senegal]]), the vast interior of Africa was not colonized and indeed little known to Europeans until the late [[nineteenth century]].

==The Scramble for Africa==
:''Main article: [[Scramble for Africa]]''

Established empires, notably Britain, Portugal and France, had already expropriated vast areas of Africa and Asia, and emerging imperial powers like Italy and Germany had done likewise on a smaller scale. With the dismissal of the aging [[Otto von Bismarck|Chancellor Bismarck]] by [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the relatively orderly colonization became a frantic scramble. The [[1885]] Congress of Berlin, initiated by Bismarck to establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory, formalized this &quot;[[New Imperialism]]&quot;. Between the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[World War I|Great War]], [[Europe]] added almost 9 million square miles (23,000,000 km&amp;sup2;) &amp;#8212; one-fifth of the land area of the globe &amp;#8212; to its overseas colonial possessions.

== Decolonization ==
:''Main article: [[Decolonization of Africa]]''
The main period of decolonization in Africa began after [[World War II]].  Growing independence movements, indigeneous political parties and trade unions coupled with pressure from within the imperialist powers and from the [[United States]] ensured the decolonization of virtually the whole of the continent by [[1980]].  While some areas, in particular [[South Africa]], retain a large population of European descent, only the Spanish [[enclave]]s of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the islands of [[Reunion]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]] remain under European control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''for other uses of this word, see [[Concentration (disambiguation)]]''
In [[chemistry]], '''concentration''' is the measure of how much of a given [[chemical substance|substance]] there is mixed with another substance. This can apply to any sort of chemical mixture, but most frequently is used in relation to [[solution]]s, where it refers to the amount of ''solute'' dissolved in a ''solvent''.

To '''concentrate''' a solution, one must add more solute, or reduce the amount of solvent (for instance, by selective [[evaporation]]). By contrast, to '''[[dilute]]''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute.

There exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve. Instead,  [[Phase (matter)#Phase separation|phase separation]] will occur, leading to either coexisting phases or a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute. 

Concentration may be expressed both [[qualitative|qualitatively]] ('informally') or [[quantitative|quantitatively]] ('numerically').

== Qualitative notation ==
Qualitatively, solutions of relatively low concentration are described using adjectives such as &quot;dilute,&quot; or &quot;weak,&quot; while solutions of relatively high concentration are described as &quot;concentrated,&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot; As a rule, the more concentrated a [[color|chromatic]] solution is, the more intensely coloured it is.

[[Image:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|none|These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are &quot;weaker&quot; (or more dilute), compared to the &quot;stronger&quot; (or more concentrated) solutions on the right.]]

== Quantitative notation ==
Quantitative notation of concentration is far more informative and useful from a scientific point of view. There are a number of different ways to quantitatively express concentration; the most common are listed below.

''Note: Many units of concentration require measurement of a substance's volume, which is variable depending on ambient temperature and pressure. Unless otherwise stated, all the following measurements are assumed to be at [[standard state]] temperature and pressure (that is, 25 degrees [[Celsius]] at 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] or 101.325'' kPa'').''

===Mass percentage===
''Mass percentage'' denotes the [[mass]] of a substance in a mixture as a [[percentage]] of the mass of the entire mixture. For instance: if a bottle contains 40 [[gram]]s of [[ethanol]] and 60 grams of [[water]], then it contains 40% ethanol by mass. Commercial concentrated aqueous reagents such as acid and bases are often labeled in concentrations of ''weight percentage'' with the [[specific gravity]] also listed. In older texts and references this is sometimes referred to as ''weight-weight percentage'' (abbreviated as ''w/w'').

===Mass-volume percentage===
''Mass-volume percentage'', (sometimes referred to as weight-volume percentage and often abbreviated as % m/v or % w/v) denotes the mass of a substance in a mixture as a percentage of the volume of the entire mixture. Mass-volume percentage is often used for solutions made from
solid reagents. It is the mass of the solute in grams multiplied by one hundred divided by the volume of solution in millilitres.

===Volume-volume percentage===
''Volume-volume percentage'' or % (v/v) describes the volume of the solute in mL  per 100 mL of the resulting solution. This is most useful when a liquid - liquid solution is being prepared. For example, beer is about 5% ethanol by volume. This means every 100 mL beer contains 5 mL
ethanol (ethyl alcohol).

===Molarity=== 
''Molarity'' (M) denotes the number of [[mole (unit)|mole]]s of a given substance per [[litre]] of solution. For instance: 4.0 litres of liquid, containing 2.0 moles of dissolved particles, constitutes a solution of 0.5 M. Such a solution may be described as &quot;0.5 molar.&quot; (Working with moles can be highly advantageous, as they enable measurement of the absolute number of particles in a solution, irrespective of their weight and volume. This is often more useful when performing [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] calculations.). See [[molar solution]] for further information.

===Molality=== 
''Molality'' (m) denotes the number of moles of a given substance per kilogram of solvent. For instance: 2.0 kilograms of solvent, containing 1.0 moles of dissolved particles, constitutes a molality of 0.5 mol/kg. Such a solution may be described as &quot;0.5 molal.&quot;

The advantage of molality is that it does not change with the temperature as it deals with the mass of solvent, rather than the volume of solution. Volume typically increases with increase in temperature resulting in decrease in molarity. Molality of a solution is always constant irrespective of the physical conditions like temperature and pressure.

===Molinity===
''Molinity'' is a rarely-used term that denotes the number of moles of a given substance per [[kilogram]] of solution. For instance: imagine 2.0 kg of solvent, plus 1.0 mol of dissolved particles, weighs a total of 2.5 kg. The molinity of the solution is therefore 1 mol / 2.5 kg = 0.4 mol/kg. 

:''Note: molarity and molinity are calculated using the volume of the entire solution, but molality is calculated using the mass of solvent only.''

:

===Normality===
''Normality'' is a concept related to ''molarity'', usually applied to [[acid]]-[[base (chemistry)|base]] solutions and reactions. For acid-base reactions, the equivalent is the mass of acid or base that can accept or donate exactly one mole of protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions). Normality is also used for [[redox]] reactions. In this case the equivalent is the quantity of oxidizing or reducing agent that can accept or furnish one mole of [[electron]]s.

Whereas molarity measures the number of particles per litre of solution, normality measures the number of [[equivalent weight (chemistry)|equivalents]] per litre of solution. 

In practice, this simply means one multiplies the molarity of a solution by the [[valence]] of the ionic solute. A bit more complex for redox reactions.

''Note: The normality is always equal to, or greater than the molarity for acid-base reactions. However, for redox reactions the normality is typically equal to or less than the molarity.''

===Mole fraction=== 
The ''[[mole fraction]]'' &amp;chi;, chi (also called ''molar fraction'') denotes the number of moles of solute as a proportion of the total number of moles in a solution. For instance: 1 mole of solute dissolved in 9 moles of solvent would have a mole fraction of 1/10 or 0.1.

===Formal===
The ''formal'' (F) is yet another measure of concentration similar to molarity. It is used rarely. It is calculated based on the formula weights of chemicals per litre of solution. The difference between formal and molar concentrations is that the formal concentration indicates moles of the original chemical formula in solution, without regard for the species that actually exist in solution. Molar concentration, on the other hand, is the concentration of species in solution. 

For example: if one dissolves sodium carbonate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in a litre of water, the compound dissociates into the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with the water to form HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If the pH of the solution is low, there is practically no Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; left in the solution. So, although we have added 1 mol of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the solution, it does not contain 1 M of that substance. (Rather, it contains a molarity based on the other constituents of the solution.) However, one can still say that the solution contains 1 F of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. 

===&quot;Parts-per&quot; notation=== 
The ''parts-per'' notation is used for extremely low concentrations. This is often used to denote the relative abundance of trace [[chemical element|elements]] in the Earth's crust, trace elements in forensics or other analyses, or levels of [[pollutant]]s in the [[natural environment|environment]].

*''Parts per [[hundred]]'' (denoted by '%' and very rarely 'pph') - denotes one particle of a given substance for every 99 other particles. This is the common percent. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''Parts per [[1000 (number)|thousand]]'' (denoted by '&amp;#137;' [the per mil symbol], and occasionally 'ppt') denotes one particle of a given substance for every 999 other particles. This is roughly equivalent to one drop of ink in a cup of water, or one second per 17 minutes. 'Parts per thousand' is often used to record the [[salinity]] of [[seawater]]. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''[[Parts per million]]'' ('ppm') denotes one particle of a given substance for every 999,999 other particles. This is roughly equivalent to one drop of ink in a 40 gallon drum of water, or one second per 280 hours. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''Parts per [[billion]]'' ('[[ppb]]') denotes one particle of a given substance for every 999,999,999 other particles. This is roughly equivalent to one drop of ink in a [[canal lock]] full of water, or one second per 32 years. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''Parts per [[trillion]]'' ('ppt') denotes one particle of a given substance for every 999,999,999,999 other particles. This is roughly equivalent to one drop of ink in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, or one second every 320 centuries. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''Parts per [[quadrillion]]'' ('ppq') denotes one particle of a given substance for every 999,999,999,999,999 other particles. This is roughly equivalent to a drop of ink in a medium-sized lake, or one second every 32,000 [[millennium|millennia]]. There are a few analytical techniques that can measure ppq concentrations; and it is used in some mathematical models of [[toxicology]] and [[epidemiology]]. 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.  Some contaminants such as methylmercury can be present in lakes at ppq concentrations and are biomagnified such that fish contain ppm concentrations of mercury.

Warning: although 'ppt' is usually used to denote 'parts per trillion', it is also on occasion used to denote 'parts per thousand'. If there is any chance of ambiguity, one should describe the abbreviation in full.

According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI),'' &quot;the language-dependent terms part per million, part per billion, and part per trillion ... are not acceptable for use with the SI to express the values of quantities.&quot; [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.10.3] which lists examples of alternative expressions.

Notes for clarity:
:The indication given above is that parts per notation refers to numbers of particles (equivalent to moles), whereas in the last column of the chart below it is given by mass (grams per kilogram). Those using the notation need to state their usage to avoid confusion.

:In [[atmospheric chemistry]] the parts per notation is commonly expressed with a '''v''' following, such as '''ppmv''' (or '''ppvm''' is some usages), to indicate parts per million by volume. In gases ppmv is equivalent to ppm by particles ([[Avogadro's law]]). This works fine for gases, but may have problems with cloud droplets and smoke or other atmospheric particulate matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CLavin.jpg|right|thumb|Christine Lavin posing with her guitar]]
'''Christine Lavin''' (b. [[January 2]], [[1952]]) is a [[New York City]]-based singer, songwriter, and promoter of contemporary [[folk music]].  She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name [[Four Bitchin' Babes]].  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including ''On a Winter's Night''.

She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between emotional reflections on romance and outright comedy. Two of her more famous songs include &quot;Sensitive New Age Guys&quot; and &quot;Bald Headed Men&quot;.

In her youth, Lavin was a [[cheerleader]] in [[Geneva, New York]] and she still has impressive baton-twirling skills; she often ends a concert by twirling a glow-in-the-dark [[baton]] with the house lights turned off as she leaves the stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Cutter Expansive Classification''' system is a [[library classification]] system devised by [[Charles Ammi Cutter]]. It uses all letters rather than digits (such as [[Dewey Decimal Classification]]) or a mixture of digits (such as [[Library of Congress classification]]), and was the basis for the top categories of the [[Library of Congress classification]].

&quot;No one, perhaps, can remember it all; it cannot be learned, even in part, very quickly; but those who use the library much will find that they become familiar in time unconsciously with all that they have much occasion to use.&quot; 
from &amp;ldquo;How to Get Books&amp;rdquo; by C.A. Cutter, 1882

==History of the Cutter classification==
Charles Ammi Cutter (1837&amp;ndash;1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary [[Melvil Dewey]], originally developed his own classification scheme for the collections of the [[Boston Athenaeum]], which he served as librarian for two dozen years. He began work on it about 1880 and published the first schedules in the early 1890s. His five volume catalogue of the Athenaeum collection is a classic in bibliographic history.

The Cutter classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in [[New England]], has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Its outline served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the 20th century.

==Outline of the Cutter classification==
Like the LC classification system, texts are organized by subject. Users of Cutter, however, will find the subject headings more general than those of the LC system.

* A General works (encyclopedias, periodicals, society publications)
* B-D Philosophy, Psychology, Religion
*  E, F, G Biography, History, Geography and travels
*  H&amp;ndash;J, K Social sciences, Law
*  L&amp;ndash;T Science and technology
* U&amp;ndash;VS Military, Sports, Recreation
*  VT, VV, W Theatre, Music, Fine arts
* X Philology (expanded by language)

==How Cutter call numbers are constructed==
Most call numbers in the Cutter classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Cutter system are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.

Size of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //). 

For some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States&amp;mdash;hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.

The second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a,b,c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number&amp;mdash;e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.

On the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English&amp;mdash;other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.

'''Cem Karaca''' ([[March 19]], [[1945]] - [[February 8]], [[2004]]) was a single child of Irma Felekyan and Mehmet Ibrahim Karaca .His first group was called &quot;Dynamites&quot;, A classic Rock cover band .Then an [[Elvis Presley]] cover band called &quot;Jaguars&quot; came together .In 1967 he started to write his own music and that was the  beginning of the Anatolian Rock 'movement .
&quot;Apaslar&quot; was his first Turkish Language group that got together at the middle of 1967 .In 1969  Karaca and the bass player Serhan Karabay ' left  Apaslar and started an original Anotolian sound group called &quot;Kardaslar&quot;{Brothers} .In 1972 Karaca joined &quot;Mogollar&quot;and his masterpiece &quot;Namus Belasi&quot;was created .But Mogollar'group leader  [[Cahit Berkay]] 'wanted an International name for his band and he left for France to take the group to an another level .At this time Karaca who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound left the Mogollar and started his own band &quot;Dervisan&quot;(Dervishkhan).
Karaca and Dervisan sang poetic and proggressive songs ..In the 70's Turkey 's image was getting destroyed by the untimely civil war .
Everyone was blaming everyone for something ..Left were fighting right ..Seperatist movements ,Islamic rise ..The country was in total
chaos ..And at the same time Cem Karaca ' started to get the attention of the Government of Turkey .At times he was beeing accused of treason ,seperatist thinker ,Marxist &amp; Leninist ,and Turkish Government tried to portrey Karaca as a man who is unknowingly writing songs to start a movement against the state..
One politiciab said &quot;Karaca is simply callin citizens to a bloody war against the State ..
At the beginning of the 1979 he left for West Germany for business related issues .At this time Turkey was going through the toughest political struggles in and outside of it's soil .Country was out of control ..Everyday at least five to ten people were getting shot to dead in the streets.Even the twenty four hours military curfew did not help the situation . At [[September 12]] [[1980]] Turkish Military Forces put all to a dramatic end .General [[Kenan Evren]] 'took over the government, closed all the political parties down temprerarely .After the army take-over many people including writers, artists ,journalists  who had say in this political circus were getting caught one by one.Warrant was issued for his arrest by the Government of Turkey .
The state called Karaca back to the country several times but Karaca not knowing the outcome of his return ,decided not to come back to Turkey at least until the dust saddles down .
While he was in Germany ,his father Mehmet Ibrahim Karaca'passed on .But Cem 'could not attend to his funeral .After sometime Turkish Government decided to strip Cem Karaca' s Turkish Citizenship .Warrant stayed .
Several years after in 1987 Turkish Mother Land party leader and the time's Prime Minister of the country &quot;[[Turgut Ozal]]&quot; issued an amnesty for Karaca .And shortly after he finally returned to his country he loved  .His return also brought a new album by him &quot;Merhaba Gencler and Her zaman Genc Kalanlar&quot;this was one of his most powerful works ever .His return home was a very good news for many of his  fans .Finally wait was over .But  Karaca lost a decade ,he lost the young people ,new listeners ..He is one of the greatest musicians of Turkey ever produced .His [[Ian Anderson]] like looks and incredibly powerful voice combines with his words and beautiful sounds of the [[Anatolian Rock]] 'that he created will live forever

'''Calista Kay Flockhart''' (born [[November 11]], [[1964]] in [[Freeport, Illinois]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]].  

She is most well-known for her starring role as the temperamental lawyer in the 1997-2002 television show, [[Ally McBeal]].

== Biography ==
Calista Flockhart was born in Freeport, Illinois, to Kraft Food executive [[Ronald Flockhart]], his English-teaching wife, [[Kay Calista]] and as a sibling to her older brother [[Gary Flockhart]]. Reversing her own first and second names, her mother named her '''Calista Kay'''. The name '''Calista''' means ''most beautiful'' in Greek. 

Because her father's job required the family to move often, Calista was raised with brother Gary in [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], upstate [[New York]], and [[New Jersey]]. As a child, she wrote a play called ''Toyland'' in which she performed to a small audience at a dinner party. However, she never professed an ambition to become an actor, instead claiming she wanted to be a clown when she grew up.

Beginning in 1978 and graduating in 1982, Flockhart attended [[Shawnee High School]] in [[Medford Township, New Jersey]]. She served on the Student Council, participated in the drama program, and became a cheerleader. A football player named Brian Anderson was her high school sweetheart.

Following her graduation, Flockhart attended The Mason Gross School of the Arts at [[Rutgers University]], in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening.  In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met [[Jane Krakowski]], the best friend of her room mate. Having already worked on Broadway, Calista often questioned Jane on how to find employment there. Flockhart's acting ability was recognized when William Esper (Mason Gross' theatre director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though usually reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform in his production of [[William Inge|William Inge's]] ''Picnic''.

Flockhart graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] Degree in Theatre in 1988 as one of only a few students who successfully completed the course. Flockhart was inducted into the Rutgers Hall of Distinguished Alumni on [[May 3]], [[2003]].

After receiving her degree, Flockhart moved to New York City in 1989 where she remained until 1997, living with three other women in a two-bedroom apartment and working as a waitor and aerobics instructor whilst she simultaineously sought auditions.

In spring, 1989, Flockhart had a minor role in one episode of ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' as a babysitter. Following this, she found her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in ''[[Beside Herself]]'' alongside actor [[Melissa Joan Hart]] at the [[Circle Repertory Theatre]]. Two years later in 1991, Flockhart appeared in a television movie, ''[[Darrow]]''. 

Though she later appeared in films ''[[Naked in New York]]'' (1993) and ''[[Getting In]]'' (1994), Calista claims her big break into Hollywood came from [[Robert Redford]] who provided her with a brief but speaking part of a college student in ''[[Quiz Show]]''.

Flockhart debuted on Broadway in 1994, as the character Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. Actor [[Julie Harris]] felt Flockhart should be hired without further auditions, claiming that Calista seemed ideal for the part of her character's daughter. Flockhart recieved a [[Clarence Derwent Award]] for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] when she appeared in the movie [[Drunks]]. Later this year Flockhart starred in the title role in [[Jane Doe]] as a drug addict.

In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Gene Hackman]]'s characters, in ''[[The Birdcage]]'', her last film role before securing the starring role in the hit show ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Throughout this year she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''.

In 1997 Calista was requested to audition as the starring role in [[David E. Kelley]]'s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX television]] series, [[Ally McBeal]]. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though Flockhart at first hesistated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiatable contract, she was swayed by the compelling script and travelled to Los Angeles to audition for the part, which she was later informed of winning. Through 1997 to 2002 Flockhart starred the show's self-titled protagonist ''Ally McBeal'', winning a [[Golden Globe Award]] for her role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the [[June 29]], [[1998]] cover of ''[[Time]]'' magazine as her character Ally McBeal, placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of feminism, relating to the on-going debate about the role depicted by her character.

As her popularity as ''Ally McBeal'' peaked, rumours began to spread that Flockhart suffered from the medical conditions [[anorexia]] and/or [[bulimia]]. These rumours heightened the criticism Flockhart met as to being a poor role-model for young women. It has also been speculated that she has been a drug user. Flockhart maintains that she has never been diagnosed with either of these medical conditions, nor has she been a user of illegal drugs. She has remarked, however, that while starring as Ally McBeal she refrained from eating sweets, retaining her slim figure by working out.

While starring as Ally McBeal, Flockhart played the role of Helena in the 1999 film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. In 2000, she appeared in ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'' and ''[[Bash: Latter-Day Plays]]'', later accompanying [[Eve Ensler]] to Kenya in order to protest against violence against women, particularly FGM ([[Female Genital Mutilation]]). Flockhart also starred in the off-Broadway production of Ensler's ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''. 

On [[January 11]], [[2001]], Flockhart adopted a baby boy, born ten days prior, whom she named Liam.

Flockhart has been romantically involved with actor [[Harrison Ford]] since meeting him at the 2002 [[Golden Globe Awards]] after she spilled wine on his award, initiating a social exchange which resulted in the pair dating within a week.

In 2004, Flockhart appeared as [[Matthew Broderick]]'s psychotic girlfriend in ''[[The Last Shot]]''. In the same year, Flockhart travelled to Barcelona, Spain, for the filming of the film ''[[Fragile (film)|Fragile]]'',  which premiered in [[September]], [[2005]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. 

When approached to star in the film ''[[Indiana Jones 4]]'', [[Harrison Ford]] requested that Flockhart co-star as the love interest of Indiana. Though the film producers agreed, Flockhart is not currently attatched to the project. Flockhart's reaction to being asked to star has been quoted as the facetious &quot;Oh, yes. If I could kick his (butt), absolutely!&quot;

Flockhart continues to support charities such as Public Schools Arts, and causes such as breast cancer.  She is the national spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women ([[LACAAW]]), which led her to require a [[Humanitarian Award]] on [[October 21]], [[2005]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the computer science usage see [[convolution (computer science)]].''

In [[mathematics]] and in particular, [[functional analysis]], '''convolution''' is a mathematical [[operator]] which takes two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s ''f'' and ''g'' and produces a third function that in a sense represents the amount of overlap between ''f'' and a reversed and translated version of ''g''. A convolution is a kind of very general '''moving [[average]]''', as one can see by taking one of the functions to be an [[indicator function]] of an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]].

==Uses==
Convolution and related operations are found in many applications of engineering and mathematics.
* In [[statistics]], as noted above, a weighted moving average is a convolution.
* In statistics, the [[probability distribution]] of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of each of their distributions.
* In optics, many kinds of &quot;blur&quot; are described by convolutions. A shadow (e.g. the shadow on the table when you hold your hand between the table and a light source) is the convolution of the [[shape]] of the light source that is casting the shadow and the object whose shadow is being cast. An out-of-focus photograph is the convolution of the sharp image with the blur [[circle]] formed by the iris diaphragm.
* In acoustics, an echo is the convolution of the original sound with a function representing the various objects that are reflecting it.
* In artificial [[reverberation]] ([[digital signal processing]], pro audio), convolution is used to map the [[impulse response]] of a real room on a digital audio signal (see previous and next point for additional information).
* In electrical engineering and other disciplines, the output (response) of a (stationary, or time- or space-[[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]) [[linear system]] is the convolution of the input (excitation) with the system's response to an impulse or [[Dirac delta]] function. See [[LTI system theory]] and [[digital signal processing]].
* In time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, the excitation signal can be treated as a chain of delta pulses, and the measured fluorescence is sum of exponential decays from each delta pulse.
* In [[physics]], wherever there is a linear system with a &quot;superposition&quot; principle, a convolution operation makes an appearance.

==Definition==
The convolution of ''f'' and ''g'' is written &lt;math&gt;f*g&lt;/math&gt;. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.

: &lt;math&gt;(f  * g )(t) = \int f(\tau) g(t - \tau)\, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

The integration range depends on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] on which the functions  are defined. While the symbol &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is used above, it need not represent the time domain.  In the case of a finite integration range, ''f'' and ''g'' are often considered to extend [[periodic function|periodic]]ally in both directions, so that the term ''g''(''t'' &amp;minus; &amp;tau;) does not imply a range violation.  This use of periodic domains is sometimes called a [[Circular convolution | '''cyclic''', '''circular''' or '''periodic convolution''']].  Of course, extension with zeros is also possible.  Using zero-extended or infinite domains is sometimes called a '''linear convolution''', especially in the discrete case below.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are two [[independent (probability)|independent]] [[random variable]]s with [[probability distribution|probability distributions]] ''f'' and ''g'', respectively, then the probability distribution of the sum &lt;math&gt;X + Y&lt;/math&gt; is given by the convolution ''f'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''g''.

For discrete functions, one can use a discrete version of the convolution.
It is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;(f  * g)(m) = \sum_n {f(n) g(m - n)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

When multiplying two [[polynomial]]s, the coefficients of the product are given by the convolution of the original coefficient [[sequence]]s, in this sense (using extension with zeros as mentioned above).

Generalizing the above cases, the convolution can be defined for any two [[integrable]] functions defined on a [[locally compact]] [[topological group]]. A different generalization is the convolution of distributions.

==Properties==
The various convolution operators all satisfy the following properties:

===Commutativity===
: &lt;math&gt;f * g = g * f \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Associativity===
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g  * h) = (f  * g)  * h \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Distributivity===
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g + h) = (f  * g) + (f  * h) \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Associativity with scalar multiplication===
: &lt;math&gt;a (f  * g) = (a f)  * g = f  * (a g) \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any real (or complex) number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

===Differentiation rule===
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(f  * g) = \mathcal{D}f  * g = f  * \mathcal{D}g \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}f&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; or, in the discrete case, the [[difference operator]] 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}f(n) = f(n+1) - f(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Convolution theorem===
The [[convolution theorem]] states that 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}(f  * g) =  \mathcal{F} (f) \cdot \mathcal{F} (g)   &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F(f)'' denotes the [[Fourier transform]] of ''f''.  Versions of this theorem also hold for the [[Laplace transform]], [[two-sided Laplace transform]] and [[Mellin transform]].

==Convolutions on groups==

If ''G'' is a suitable [[group (mathematics)|group]] endowed with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''m'' (for instance, a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space | Hausdorff]] [[topological group]] with the [[Haar measure]]) and if ''f'' and ''g'' are real or complex valued m-[[Lebesgue integral|integrable]] functions of G, then we can define their convolution by

:&lt;math&gt;(f  * g)(x) = \int_G f(y)g(xy^{-1})\,dm(y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, it is also possible to give, for instance, a Convolution Theorem, however it is much more difficult to phrase and requires [[group representation|representation theory]] for these types of groups and the [[Peter-Weyl theorem]] of [[Harmonic analysis]]. It is very difficult to do these calculations without more structure, and [[Lie group|Lie groups]] turn out to be the setting in which these things are done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Calico''' is a fabric made from unbleached, and often not fully processed, [[cotton]]. It may contain unseparated husk parts, for example. The [[Cloth|fabric]] is less coarse and thick than [[canvas]] or [[denim]], but owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance, it is still very cheap.

==Etymology==
The name ''Calico'' is derived from the name of the city of [[Calicut]], [[Kerala]], [[India]].

==History==
In [[1700]], [[Britain]] banned importation (and the use and wear of) of cotton cloth from India, in an effort to prop up British [[textile]] industry. Printed calicos were especially popular among women who were termed the 'Calico Madams'. The ban failed, and was strengthened in [[1720]] (known as the 'Calico Act', it was repealed in [[1774]]). It almost destroyed the Indian textile industry, and India was forced to buy British textiles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Calorimetry''' is the [[science]] of measuring the [[heat]] of [[chemical reaction]]s or [[physical change]]s. Calorimetry involves the use of a [[calorimeter]].The word calorimetry is derived from the Latin word calor, meaning heat.


== [[Temperature]] and Internal [[Energy]] ==
At all temperatures above [[absolute zero]], atoms possess varying amounts of [[kinetic energy]] of vibration. As neighboring atoms collide with each other, this energy is passed back and forth.  Although the energy of individual atoms may vary as a result of these energy-sharing collisions, a collection of atoms isolated from the outside world has a total amount of energy that doesn't change as it gets passed around from atom to atom.  Conceptually, an average energy per atom can be calculated by dividing the total energy by the number of atoms.

Although we don't know the total energy of an object's atoms or perform that calculation directly, we can measure the effect of that average kinetic energy - it is that object's temperature.  An increase in the average kinetic  energy of the atoms in the object show up as an increase in its temperature and vice versa.

If an object is isolated from the rest of the universe, its temperature must stay constant.  If energy enters or leaves, the temperature must change.  Energy moving from one place to another is called  '''[[heat]]''' and calorimetry uses the measurement of temperature changes to track the movement of heat.

===Constant-volume===
''Constant-volume calorimetry'' is [[calorimetry]] performed at a constant [[volume]]. This involves the use of a [[constant-volume calorimeter]].

No work is performed in constant-volume calorimetry, so the heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system. The equation for constant-volume calorimetry is:

:&lt;math&gt;q = C_V \Delta t = \Delta U \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since in ''constant-volume calorimetry'' [[pressure]] is not kept constant, the heat measured does not represent the ''[[enthalpy]] change''.

=== Constant-pressure ===

''Constant-pressure calorimetry'' is [[calorimetry]] performed at a constant [[pressure]]. This involves the use of a [[constant-pressure calorimeter]].

The heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system minus the work performed:

: &lt;math&gt; q = \Delta U - w  \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since in ''constant-pressure calorimetry'', [[pressure]] is kept constant, the heat measured represents the ''enthalpy change'':

: &lt;math&gt;q = \Delta H = H_\mathrm{final} - H_\mathrm{initial} \,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Charles Evans Hughes''' ([[April 11]], [[1862]] &amp;ndash; [[August 27]], [[1948]]) was [[Governor of New York]], [[United States Secretary of State]], and [[Chief Justice of the United States]].

Hughes was a precocious youngster. At age 6 he found public school boring and confining, and submitted to his parents a plan of study for [[home schooling]], which his parents accepted. Shortly before his 12th birthday, his family moved from [[Glens Falls, New York]] to [[New York City]], where his parents enrolled him in public school, and he graduated from high school at age 13, second in his class. His father was a Baptist minister from Wales, so he too followed the Baptist religion.

He went to Madison College (now [[Colgate University]]) for two years (where he became a member of [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity), then transferred to [[Brown University]], where he continued as a member of [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity, where he graduated in [[1881]] at age 19, youngest in his class, receiving third-highest honors. For the next year, he worked at Delaware Academy, in [[Delhi, New York]] where he taught Greek, [[Latin]] and [[algebra]], in order to earn money to enter [[law school]]. He entered [[Columbia University]] law school in [[1882]], and graduated in [[1884]] with highest honors.

In [[1885]] he met Antoinette Carter, daughter of a senior partner of the law firm where he worked, and married her in [[1888]].

In [[1891]] he left the practice of law to become a professor at [[Cornell University]] Law School, but in [[1893]] he returned to his old law firm.

In [[1905]] he was appointed counsel to a New York state legislative committee investigating utility rates. He uncovered corruption to get gas rates lowered in [[New York City]]. As a result, he was appointed to investigate the [[insurance]] industry in New York.

He served as [[Governor of New York]] from [[1907]]&amp;ndash;[[1910]], defeating [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the [[1906]] election to gain the position, and being the only [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] statewide candidate to win office. In [[1908]] he was offered the [[Vice President of the United States of America|vice-presidential]] nomination by [[William Howard Taft]], but declined it to run again for Governor.

In 1909 he led the Charge to incorporate [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity and created a headquarters for the organization in Indianapolis, IN.  He served as the first International president of the Fraternity which was the first fraternity to incorperate.  Today several other fraternities have followed Hughes' lead by incorperating and located in Indianapolis.

Subsequently he was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], serving [[1910]]&amp;ndash;[[1916]], when he resigned to be Republican candidate for [[U.S. presidential election|election]] as [[President of the United States]]. Defeated by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in a close election, he returned to private law practice. {{see|U.S. presidential election, 1916}}

In [[1920]], Hughes favored the ratification of the treaty creating the [[League of Nations]]. 

His next position in the United States government was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[Warren G. Harding]]  and [[Calvin Coolidge]] from [[1921]]&amp;ndash;[[1925]]. As Secretary of State, he convened the [[Washington Conference]] in [[1921]], regulating naval armament among the [[Great Powers]].  In the [[1920s]] he served as a judge of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in [[The Hague]], [[The Netherlands]]. [[Herbert Hoover]], who had appointed Hughes' son  as [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] in [[1929]],  appointed Hughes to [[Chief Justice of the United States]] in [[1930]], in which capacity he served until [[1941]]. As Chief Justice, he led the fight against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s attempt to [[Court-packing Bill|pack the Supreme Court]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pepper's.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]], the most famous and one of the first concept albums in rock and roll.]]

In [[popular music]] a '''concept album''' is an [[album]] which is pre-planned (conceived), most often with all songs contributing to [[Metanarrative|a single overall theme or unified story]], this plan or story being the [[concept]]. This is in contrast to the standard practice of an artist or group releasing an album consisting of a number of unconnected songs that the members of the group or the artist have written, or have chosen to perform or cover.  Given that the suggestion of something as vague as an overall mood often tags a work as being a concept album, a precise definition of the term proves highly problematic.

In the meaning attributed to the words &quot;concept album&quot; in the contemporary rock era (from 1966 onwards - the point at which critics started to differentiate between &quot;pop music&quot; and &quot;rock music&quot; as a more serious form) - there were broadly speaking two genres of concept album:  those that were essentially thematically-linked song cycles such as [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which did not claim a storyline, and those that presented a narrative story that threaded the songs - such as [[The Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (rock opera)| Tommy]]''.   Music critics of that era did not usually distinguish between the two genres of concept album. An album that met either criterion was commonly referred to as a concept album.  However, the distinction between the two types of concept album is instructive to note in respect of claims that are made as to which album may have been the &quot;first&quot; concept album in the rock era.  Given this legitimate distinction - there are probably several contenders in each genre.

What could very loosely be considered the first concept albums were released in the late 1930s by singer [[Lee Wiley]] on the [[Liberty Records]] label, featuring eight songs on four 78s by great [[showtunes]] composers of the day, such as [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Cole Porter]], anticipating more comprehensive efforts by [[Verve Records]] impresario [[Norman Granz]] with [[Ella Fitzgerald]] by almost two decades.  In [[folk music]], [[Woody Guthrie]]'s 1940 debut album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'' is also an early possibility.  In 1973 country and pop music icon Bobby Bare recorded &quot;Lullabys, Legends and Lies&quot; which was written by Shel Silverstein.  The record was arguably the first Concept Album for country music.

[[Frank Sinatra]], both with early albums originally released as 78s for [[Columbia Records]] such as ''[[The Voice]]'' from 1945, and continuing through his thematically programmed albums of the 1950s for [[Capitol Records]] starting with the ten-inch 33s ''[[Songs for Young Lovers]]'' and ''[[Swing Easy]]'', is generally credited with both popularizing and developing the concept album, and it was at this time that the specific term was first used.  &lt;!-- This claim was in a previous version of the article.  Is it true?  Does anyone have a source for it? --&gt;  Perhaps the first full Sinatra concept album example is ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' from 1955, where the songs – all ballads – were specifically recorded for the album, and organized around a central mood of late-night isolation and aching lost love, and the album cover strikingly reinforced that theme.

However, notion of a concept album did not really gel at that point, and was not widely imitated, aside from occasional examples such as [[country music|country]] singer [[Marty Robbins]]' ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'' from 1959, or, as the first example from rock, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' from 1963 by [[The Beach Boys]], each of whose 12 songs were about America's car culture.

In 1966, several rock releases were arguably concept albums in the sense that they presented a set of themetically-linked songs - and they also instigated other rock artists to consider using the album format in a similar fashion:  ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', again by the Beach Boys, a masterful musical portrayal of [[Brian Wilson]]'s would-be state of mind (and a huge inspiration to [[Paul McCartney]]); the [[Mothers of Invention]]'s sardonic farce about rock music and America as a whole, ''[[Freak Out!]]''; and ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' by [[The Kinks]], the first collection of [[Ray Davies]]'s idiosyncratic character studies of ordinary people.  However, none of these attracted a wide commercial audience.

This all changed with [[The Beatles]]' celebrated 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. With this release in June of 1967, the notion of the concept album came to the forefront of the popular and critical mind, with the earlier prototypes and examples from [[classic pop]] and other genres sometimes forgotten.  The phrase entered the popular lexicon.  And a &quot;concept album&quot; - the term became imbued with the notion of artistic purpose - was inherently considered to be somehow more creative or worthy of attention than a mere collection of new songs.  This perception of course related to the '''intent''' of the artist rather than the specific content. 

In fact, as pointed out by many critics since its original reception, ''Sgt. Pepper'' is a concept album only by some definitions of the term. There was, at some stage during the making of the album an attempt to relate the material to an obscure radio play about the life of an ex-army bandsman and his shortcomings but this concept was lost in the final production.  On it, the Beatles supposedly adopt fictionalized personae, and the title song, styled as the theme song of the fictional &quot;Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, wraps around the rest of the album like bookends.  However, most of the songs on the album are narratively unrelated to the theme, and the fictional characters have little life beyond the introduction of [[Ringo Starr]] as &quot;Billy Shears&quot; in the segue between the first two tracks.  On the other hand, the slice-of-life character miniatures and short story structure of many of the songs, especially those penned primarily by [[Paul McCartney]], echo elements commonly found in other thematic works such as [[musicals]] and [[opera]].  This feeling was reinforced by the album's device use of running musical tracks one after the other (without a pause) or linked with transitions rather than the customary silent space between tracks.  Even more striking was the album's opulent cover, packaged inserts, and full lyrics printed on the back, all of which suggested a unified work more than just a collection of songs.  In any case, while debate exists over the extent to which ''Sgt. Pepper'' qualifies as a true concept album, there is no doubt that its reputation as such helped inspire other artists to produce concept albums of their own, and inspired the public to anticipate them.   The Beatles themselves were very proud of ''Sgt. Pepper'' for its artistic achievements but both Lennon and McCartney distanced themselves from the &quot;concept album&quot; tag as applied to that album.

In the wake of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' triumph, concept albums became the rage among serious rock artists, with mixed results.  The [[Rolling Stones]] attempted to duplicate ''Sgt. Pepper'' with more explicitly drug and occult-inspired overtones with ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', but it proved to be a commercial and artistic failure, one that the Stones quickly learned from and moved on. The album made no attempt to fashion a concept around the disparate songs on the album.  The unifying nature of the album (such as it was) came primarily from the musical atmosphere and the subject matter of the lyrics.  And the psychedelic cover art.  The Stones themselves never identified the album as a concept album.

The album ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' (released in December 1968) by British group [[The Pretty Things]] is generally considered to be among the first creatively successful rock concept albums - in that each song is part of an overarching unified concept -- the life story of the main character, Sebastian Sorrow. Despite its effective production qualities and strong material, and although it received almost unanimously glowing reviews on release, the album was not a major commercial success.  However, the fact that the album format had now been effectively used to present a threaded storyline was noted by other artists such as [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] and [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]] - both of whom were already working on their own projects in this genre.  In this respect, the Pretty Things album did have an impact on some influential artists and on rock culture itself.  Prior to this release - the band had been considered an R&amp;B ([[rhythm and blues]]) band - but their venture into producing a concept album did at least result in the band being re-cast in general perception as a [[progressive rock]] band - an important and valuable transition at that time.

Released just five months later in April 1969, was the &quot;[[rock opera]]&quot; ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' composed by [[Pete Townshend]] and performed by [[The Who]]. This acclaimed work was presented over two discs (still unusual in those days) and it took the idea of thematically based albums to a much higher appreciation by both critics and the public. It was also the first ''story-based'' concept album of the rock era (as distinct from the ''song-cycle'' style album) to enjoy commercial success. The Who went on to further explorations of the concept album format with their follow-up project ''[[Lifehouse (album)|Lifehouse]]'' - which was abandoned before completion and with their 1973 rock opera ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.

Five months after the release of ''Tommy'' [[The Kinks]] released their own rock opera ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' (September 1969) written by [[Ray Davies]] - the first of several concept albums released by the band through the first few years of the 1970s.  These were: ''[[Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]'' (1970), ''[[Preservation Act 1]]'' (1973), ''[[Preservation Act 2]]'' (1974),  ''[[Soap Opera (album)|Soap Opera]]'' (1975) and ''[[Schoolboys in Disgrace]]'' (1976)

Two albums released in the autumn of 1967 were also concept albums - though they did not get the same media attention later accorded to [[The Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''.

''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' (1967) by the [[Moody Blues]], alternated songs by the group with orchestral interludes to document a typical &quot;everyman's day&quot;. Though music critics did not accord the album or the band the same respect given to bands deemed to have more ''street credibility'' such as [[The Who]] and [[The Kinks]] - the album was very successful commercially. 

''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'' by [[Nirvana (UK band)|Nirvana]] produced by Island Records' founder [[Chris Blackwell]] was issued in October 1967 in a &quot;gatefold cover&quot; (most unusual packaging for a debut album) which presented a text giving the storyline of the album - described as a &quot;science fiction pantomime&quot;.  The album attracted positive critical attention but did not enjoy big sales in the UK.   

Concept albums are especially common in the [[progressive rock]] genre of the 1970s, although rarely did that equal a lasting commercial or critical legacy for the band or artist involved.  Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] recast itself from its 1960s guise as a quirky, intermittently successful psychedelic band into a cash-generating monster with its classic series of concept albums, beginning with ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]'' from 1973. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull wrote a number of successful concept albums, notably &quot;Thick as A Brick&quot; which was long song about 40 minutes in length and which included material intended to &quot;spoof&quot; the concept album genre.  But in the mid to late 1970's, concept albums grew to be plagued by the suffocating nature of ever more pretentious, self-conscious themes.  These themes tended to drive the songwriters, and the quality of the individual songs suffered.  A prime example of this was [[Styx]]' overblown and unintentionally humorous 1983 album ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', a late and poorly received entry into the genre that effectively marked the end of the 1970's-style theatrical rock operas. (although [[Queensrÿche]]'s ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'' was able to find critical and commercial success.)

Within the [[progressive metal]] genre, [[Dream Theater]] ended the 20th Century with ''Metropolis Part 2: [[Scenes from a Memory]]'' in 1999.  This concept album was a sequel to their original song from their 1992 album [[Images and Words]], about a present day man's nightmares of his death in his previous life in 1928.

In the intervening decades, concept albums have often been out of vogue, but [[Radiohead]] duplicated that kind of acceptance both from the critics and in the marketplace with ''[[OK Computer]]'' from 1997, and the related ''[[Kid A]]'' and ''[[Amnesiac]]'' albums of 2000 and 2001. [[The Mars Volta]] have created two highly complex concept albums. The first of which, ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'', chronicles the morphine-induced coma of the character Cerpin Taxt.

Since the 1980s, concept albums have been frequent in the [[power metal]] and [[epic metal]] genres.  One of the most notable power metal bands to use the concept ablum is Kamelot.  Kamelot's last two releases, Epica and The Black Halo, are two parts of a tale following the protagonist Ariel and his interations with the many different forms and experiences with the evil Mephisto.  The two album story is based on Goethe's Faust.

Except for [[George Clinton]]'s [[P-Funk]] albums from the 1970's, the first recent [[R&amp;B]] concept album is ''TP.3 Reloaded'', by [[R. Kelly]] released in 2005, which features 5 chapters of the &quot;Trapped... in the Closet&quot; soap opera.  The album received a great deal of press for being ground breaking in the R&amp;B genre.  Kelly subsequently released a ''Trapped... in the Closet'' DVD of music videos containing chapters 1-12, completing the rambling tale of unfaithful lovers. 

An example for a [[Techno]] concept album is Metropolis by [[Jeff Mills]] (2001), yet another alternative score for the [[Metropolis (1927 film)|movie]] of the same name.

An emerging subset is the [[historical album]], which is more closely tied with specific historically accurate references to persons or places.

An ambitious extension of the concept album idea could be realized in a series of albums which all contribute to a single effect or unified story. Contemporary examples include [[Coheed and Cambria]]'s in-progress tetralogy of records and [[mind.in.a.box]]'s ''[[Lost Alone]]'' and ''[[Dreamweb (album)|Dreamweb]]'' albums which describe an on-going sci-fi themed story in a ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]''-like universe. [[Brave Saint Saturn]] has planned a trilogy to tell the story of mankinds first mission to the planet [[Saturn]]. Arguably the most ambitious of these is [[Sufjan Stevens]]' Fifty-States project, in which he plans to write a series of albums encompassing the concept of the entire [[United States of America]], one for each state, totalling fifty records.  

The concept album genre overlaps with [[rock opera]], of which the most famous early example is [[The Who]]'s aforementioned ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' (1969). Like ''Sgt. Pepper'', ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' greatly boosted the visibility of the concept album idea, and the genre also overlaps to a lesser extent with [[rock musical]], of which the most famous early example is ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967).   

This style of album has made its way into the rap genre, namely [[Cage Kennylz]] &amp; [[Camu Tao]]'s [[2001]] release of ''[[Are The Nighthawks (album)]]'' and [[Cage Kennylz]] &amp; [[Tame One]]'s [[2004]] release of ''[[Waterworld (album)]]''. The Nighthawk's album was a trip into the darkside of being a cop, while Waterworld was a blast of [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] induced rhymes, being refered to as a ''drug related themepark''.  Rapper [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]] had also planned for his third release in 1998 to be a double-album entitled ''[[I Am...]]'' that would detail the birth, death, and resurrection of a Jesus-like character known as [[Nastradamus]], but heavy bootlegging forced him to change plans and release two separate albums with many new songs, abandoning the concept he had earlier.  Many of the songs that did not appear on either album were subsequently released on 2002's ''[[The Lost Tapes]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], '''critical theory''' has two quite different meanings with different origins and histories, one originating in [[social theory]] and the other in [[literary criticism]].  Though until recently these two meanings had little to do with each other, since the 1970s there has been some overlap between these disciplines.  This has led to &quot;critical theory&quot; becoming an umbrella term for an array of theories within the academic world of the United Kingdom and the United States.  This article focuses primarily on the differences and similarities between them.

==Critical theory (social theory)==
{{main|Critical theory (Frankfurt School)}}
The first meaning of  the term ''critical theory'' was that defined by [[Max Horkheimer]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] of social science in his 1937 essay ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' :  critical theory is social theory oriented toward critiquing and changing society as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only to understanding or explaining it.  Horkheimer wanted to distinguish critical theory as a radical, emancipatory form of Marxian theory both from the model of science put forward by [[logical positivism]] and from what he and his colleagues perceived as the covert positivism and authoritarianism of orthodox Marxism and Communism.  It is also central to this notion that critical social theory be directed at the totality of society in its historical specificity, i.e. in the way it had come to be configured at a specific point in time, and that it integrates all of the major social science theories that will help grasp the major dimensions of society, including especially economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology.  Although this conception of critical theory originated with the Frankfurt School, it also prevails among some other recent social scientists, such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Louis Althusser]] and arguably [[Michel Foucault]] and certain [[feminist]] theorists and social scientists.

This version of &quot;critical&quot; theory derives from [[Kant]]'s (18th-century) and [[Marx]]'s (19th century) use of the term &quot;[[critique]]&quot;, as in Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Marx's notion of his work ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital'') as &quot;the critique of political economy&quot;.  For Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], &quot;critique&quot; means examining and establishing the limits of the validity of a faculty, type, or body of knowledge, especially through taking stock of the limitations imposed by the fundamental, irreducible concepts in use in that knowledge.  His notion also already associated critique with the disestablishment of false, unprovable, or dogmatic philosophical, social, and political beliefs since for him the critique of reason involved the critique of dogmatic theological and metaphysical ideas and was intertwined with the enhancement of ethical autonomy and the Enlightenment critique of superstition and irrational authority.  Marx explicitly developed this notion into the critique of ideology and linked it with the  practice of social revolution, as in his famous 11th Thesis on Feuerbach, &quot;Philosophers have only interpreted the world in certain ways; the point is to change it&quot;. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm]

This meaning of &quot;critical theory&quot; originated entirely within the social sciences, and there are works of critical social theory and critical social science that pay no attention and show no awareness of the literary/humanities version of critical theory.

==Critical theory (literary criticism)==
{{main|Literary theory}}
The second meaning of ''critical theory'' is that of theory used in literary criticism – hence &quot;critical theory&quot; -- and in the analysis and understanding of literature and is discussed in greater detail under [[literary theory]].  It is not necessarily oriented toward radical social change or even toward the analysis of society but is focused primarily on the analysis of texts and textlike phenomena.  It originated among literary scholars and in the discipline of literature in the 1960s and 1970s and really came into broad use only since the 1980s, especially as theory used in literary studies became increasingly influenced by Continental philosophy and social theory and thereby became more &quot;theoretical&quot;.

This version of &quot;critical&quot; theory derives from the notion of literary criticism as establishing and enhancing the proper [[aesthetic]] understanding and evaluation of literature, as articulated, for example, in [[Joseph Addison]]'s notion of a critic as one who helps understand and interpret literary works:  &quot;A true critic ought to dwell rather upon excellencies than imperfections, to discover the concealed beauties of a writer, and communicate to the world such things as are worth their observation.&quot; [http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/fowlerjh/chap20.htm]  This notion of criticism ultimately goes back to Aristotle's ''Poetics'' as a theory of literature.

This meaning of &quot;critical theory&quot; originated entirely within the humanities, and there are works of literary critical theory that pay no attention and show no awareness of the sociological version of critical theory.

==Relationship between the two versions==
These two meanings of critical theory derive from two different intellectual traditions associated with the meaning of criticism and critique, both of which derive ultimately from the Greek word ''kritikos'' meaning judgment or discernment and in their present forms go back to the 18th century.    While they can be considered completely independent intellectual pursuits, increasingly scholars are interested in the areas of critique where the two overlap.

To use an [[epistemological]] distinction introduced by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in 1968 in his ''Erkenntnis und Interesse'' (''Knowledge and Human Interests''), critical theory in literary studies is ultimately a form of [[hermeneutics]], i.e. knowledge via interpretation in order to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressions, obeying the practical interest in mutual understanding, while critical social theory is ultimately a form of self-reflective knowledge involving both understanding and theoretical explanation in order to reduce entrapment in systems of [[domination]] or dependence, obeying the emancipatory interest in expanding the scope of autonomy and reducing the scope of domination.  From this perspective, much literary critical theory, since it is focused on intepretation and explanation rather than on social transformation, would be regarded as positivistic or traditional rather than critical theory in the Kantian or Marxian sense.  Critical theory in literature and the humanities in general does not necessarily involve a [[normative]] dimension, whereas critical social theory does, either through criticizing society from some general theory of [[values]], norms, or oughts, or through criticizing it in terms of its own espoused values.

==Overlap between the two versions of critical theory==
Nevertheless, a certain amount of overlap has come about, initiated both from the critical social theory and the literary-critical theory sides.  It was distinctive of the Frankfurt School version of critical theory from the beginning, especially in the work of [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Leo Lowenthal]], because of their focus on the role of false consciousness and ideology in the perpetuation of capitalism, to analyze works of culture, including literature, music, art, both &quot;[[high culture]]&quot; and &quot;[[popular culture]]&quot; or &quot;mass culture.&quot;  Thus it was to some extent a theory of literature and a method of literary criticism (as in Walter Benjamin's interpretation of [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], Leo Lowenthal's interpretations of [[Shakespeare]], [[Ibsen]], etc., Adorno's interpretations of [[Kafka]], [[Valery]], [[Balzac]], [[Beckett]], etc.) and (see below) in the 1960s started to influence the literary sort of critical theory.

===Within social theory===
In the late 1960s [[Juergen Habermas]] of the Frankfurt School,  redefined critical theory in a way that freed it from a direct tie to Marxism or the prior work of the Frankfurt School.  In Habermas's epistemology, critical knowledge was conceptualized as knowledge that enabled human beings to emancipate themselves from forms of domination through self-reflection and took psychoanalysis as the paradigm of critical knowledge.  This expanded considerably the scope of what counted as critical theory within the social sciences, which would include such approaches as [[World Systems Theory|world systems theory]], [[feminist theory]], [[postcolonial theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[queer theory]], [[social ecology]], the theory of communicative action ([[Habermas]]), [[structuration theory]], and [[neo-Marxian theory]].

===Within literary theory===
From the literary side, starting in the 1960s literary scholars, reacting especially against the [[New Criticism]] of the previous decades, which tried to analyze literary texts purely internally, began to incorporate into their analyses and interpretations of literary works initially [[semiotic]], [[linguistic]], and interpretive theory, then [[structuralism]], Lacanian psychoanalysis, [[post-structuralism]], and [[deconstruction]] as well as  Continental philosophy, especially [[phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]], and critical social theory and various other forms of neo-Marxian theory.  Thus literary criticism became highly theoretical and some of those practicing it began referring to the theoretical dimension of their work as &quot;critical theory&quot;, i.e. philosophically inspired theory of literary criticism.  And thus incidentally critical theory in the sociological sense also became, especially among literary scholars of left-wing sympathies, one of a number of influences upon and streams within critical theory in the literary sense.

Furthermore, along with the expansion of the mass media and mass/popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s and the blending of social and cultural criticism and literary criticism, the methods of both kinds of critical theory sometimes intertwined in the analysis of phenomena of popular culture, as in the emerging field of [[cultural studies]], in which concepts deriving from Marxian theory, post-structuralism, semiology, psychoanalysis and feminist theory would be found in the same interpretive work.  Both strands were often present in the various modalities of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern theory]].

==Language and construction==
The two points at which there is the greatest overlap or mutual impingement of the two versions of critical theory are in their interrelated foci on language, symbolism, and communication and in their focus on construction.

===Language and communication===
From the 1960s and 1970s onward, language, symbolism, text, and meaning became foundational to theory in the humanities and social sciences, through the short-term and long-term influences of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and other thinkers in the traditions of linguistic and analytic philosophy, structural linguistics, symbolic interactionism, hermeneutics, semiology, linguistically oriented psychoanalysis (Lacan, Lorenzer), deconstruction.  When, in the 1970s and 1980s, Habermas also redefined critical social theory as a theory of communication, i.e. communicative competence and communicative rationality on the one hand, distorted communication on the other, the two versions of critical theory began to overlap or intertwine to a much greater degree than before.  

===Construction===
Both versions of critical theory have focused on the processes of synthesis, production, or construction by which the phenomena and objects of human communication, culture, and consciousness come about.  Whether it is through the transformational rules by which the deep structure of language becomes its surface structure (Chomsky), the universal pragmatic principles through which mutual understanding is generated (Habermas), the semiotic rules by which objects of daily usage or of fashion obtain their meanings (Barthes), the psychological processes by which the phenomena of everyday consciousness are generated (psychoanalytic thinkers), the ''[[episteme]]'' that underlies our cognitive formations (Foucault), and so on, there is a common interest in the processes (often of a linguistic or symbolic kind) that give rise to observable phenomena.  Here there is significant mutual influence among aspects of the different versions of critical theory.  Ultimately this emphasis on production and construction goes back to the revolution wrought by [[Kant]] in philosophy, namely his focus in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' on synthesis according to rules as the fundamental activity of the mind that creates the order of our experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The clavichord is a European [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] used in early [[European classical music|classical]], and [[Baroque]] music. Its musical sound is produced by a hammer striking strings, upon command of the player who presses keys in order to push the hammer.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mozart's_Clavichord.jpg|thumb|right|222|Mozart's clavichord]] --&gt;

==History and Use==

The clavichord was invented in the early fifteenth century, and was made in large numbers, especially  in the mid-18th century when it flourished in German-speaking lands, [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], until it fell out of use in the 1840s. [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] revived clavichord construction in the early 1900s. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small, (around 4 x 1 x 1/3 ft.) and four octaves in range, the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range. 


Today clavichords are played within modern Baroque chamber music groups. They maintain a level of interest amongst buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. A modern clavichord can range in price from $1,000, to as much as $12,000. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument include [[Derek Adlam]], [[Christopher Hogwood]], [[Paul Simmonds]], [[Richard Troeger]], and [[Miklos Spanyi]], and fine modern copies have been made by makers including [[Peter Bavington]], [[Martin Kather]], [[Joris Potvleighe]], [[Karin Richter]], [[Ronald Haas]], [[Paul Irvin]], and [[Thomas Steiner]].

The clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, like [[Rock_(music)|rock]] in the form of the [[clavinet]], which is essentially an electric clavichord which uses a magnetic pickup to provide a signal for amplification.

==Structure==
In the clavichord strings run transversely from an anchorage at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass 'tangent' at the far end which strikes the strings above. Each note usually is made up of two strings which are struck simultaneously. The note is sustained as long as the tangent is in contact with the string. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as ''[[bebung]]'') and can be used to give a form of [[vibrato]].

Since the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string (like a [[monochord]]). This is called a ''fretted clavichord''. This technique simplifies the construction since fewer strings are required, but it limits the abilities of the instrument, since only one note can be played at a time on each string. As a result there are rarely more than two notes assigned to each string. They are usually chosen so that notes which are rarely heard together (such as C and C#) are on the one string. In the late 18th century, clavichords were often built ''unfretted'', with a separate pair of strings for each key. 

Instruments were built with one or two [[manual (music)|manual]]s and pedals, for the practice use of [[pipe organ|organists]]. This use was common in the days before the invention of the electric blower, and there is speculation that some practice [[etude]]s labeled ''organ'' by the composers and now regarded as organ repertoire were in fact more accurately written for the pedal clavichord.

==Music==

Much of the music written for [[harpsichord]], [[piano]], and [[organ (music)|organ]] from the period circa 1400-1800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it is too quiet to use in any but the smallest ensembles. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s son [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]] was a great proponent of the instrument. Both [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] played the clavichord.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Centrifugal force''' (from [[Latin]] ''centrum'' &quot;center&quot; and ''fugere'' &quot;to flee&quot;) is a term which may refer to two ''different'' [[force]]s which are related to [[rotation]]. Both of them are oriented away from the [[axis of rotation]], but the object on which they are exerted differs.

* The '''[[reaction (physics)|reactive]]''' centrifugal force is the reaction to the [[centripetal force]]. This is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which exerts the centripetal force. As it is an actual force, it is always present, independent of the choice of [[reference frame]].

* The '''[[fictitious force|fictitious]]''' centrifugal force appears when a rotating reference frame is used for analyzing the system. The centrifugal force is exerted on all objects, and directed away from the axis of rotation.

Both of the above can be observed in action on a passenger riding in a car. If the car swerves around a corner, the passenger's body  pushes against the outer edge of the car. This is the reactive centrifugal force, which is called a reaction force because it results from passive interaction with the car which actively pushes against the body.

Using a reference frame which is fixed relative to the car (a model which those inside the car will often find natural) and while ignoring its rotation, it looks like an external force is pulling the passenger out of the car. This is the fictitious centrifugal force, so called because it is not an actual force exerted by some other object.

== Reactive centrifugal force ==
When viewed from an [[inertial frame of reference]], the application of [[Newton's laws of motion]] is simple. The passenger's inertia resists [[acceleration]], keeping the passenger moving with constant speed and direction as the car begins to turn. From this point of view, the passenger does not gravitate toward the outside of the car; instead, the car curves to meet the passenger.

Once the car contacts the passenger, it then applies a sidewise force to accelerate him or her around the turn with the car. This force is called a centri''petal'' (&quot;center seeking&quot;) force because its vector changes direction to continue to point toward the center of the car's arc as the car traverses it.

If the car is acting upon the passenger, then the passenger must be acting upon the car with an equal and opposite force. Being opposite, this reaction force is directed ''away'' from the center, therefore centri''fugal''. It is critical to realize that this centrifugal force acts upon the car, not the passenger. Basing the physics on an inertial reference frame, there is no mystery force pulling the passenger outward.

The ''centrifugal reaction force'' with which the passenger pushes back against the door of the car is trivial and is simply given by:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{centrifugal} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= - m \mathbf{a}_\mathrm{centripetal} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the rotating object.

== Rotating reference frames==
In the classical approach, this inertial frame remains the true reference for the laws of mechanics. When using a [[rotating reference frame]], the laws of physics are mapped from the most convenient inertial frame to that rotating frame. Assuming a constant rotation speed, this is achieved by adding to every object two ''coordinate accelerations'' which correct for the rotation of the coordinate axes.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{a} - 2\mathbf{\omega \times v} - \mathbf{\omega \times (\omega \times r)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\mathbf{a + a_\mathrm{Coriolis} + a_\mathrm{centrifugal}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration relative to the rotating frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration relative to the inertial frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]] vector describing the rotation of the reference frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the body relative to the rotating frame, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a vector from an arbitrary point on the rotation axis to the body. A derivation can be found in the article [[fictitious force]].

The last term is the centrifugal acceleration, so we have:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_\textrm{centrifugal} = - \mathbf{\omega \times (\omega \times r)} = \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r_\perp}&lt;/math&gt; is the component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

=== Derivation ===
If we have two frames, one inertial and one rotating with a constant angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;, a time derivative of a vector in the rotating frame, &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{d}{dt} \right ) _r&lt;/math&gt;, is transformed to the time derivative in the inertial frame, &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{d}{dt} \right ) _i&lt;/math&gt;, by the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac{d}{dt} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d}{dt} \right ) _r + \vec \omega \times &lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is one between two [[operator]]s.  Now, acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time.  So, applying the above transformation to the position vector &lt;math&gt; \vec r &lt;/math&gt; once gets you:

:&lt;math&gt; \dot \vec r_i = \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \vec r&lt;/math&gt;

Putting &lt;math&gt; \dot \vec r_i &lt;/math&gt; back into the transformation, you get:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot \vec r_i = \left ( \frac{d \dot \vec r}{dt} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d \dot \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \dot \vec r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ddot \vec r_i = \left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d}{dt} \right ) _r \left ( \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \vec r \right ) + \vec \omega \times \left ( \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \vec r \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt; is a contant vector - that is the rotating reference frame is rotating constantly in the same direction - it's time derivative is zero.  So, simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot \vec r_i = \left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right ) _r + \omega \times \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \vec \omega \times \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \omega \times \vec r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ddot \vec r_i = \left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right ) _i = \left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right ) _r + 2 \vec \omega \times \left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r + \omega \times \omega \times \vec r&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, putting in &lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{d^2 \vec r}{dt^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v_r&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{d \vec r}{dt} \right ) _r&lt;/math&gt;, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt; \vec a_i = \vec a_r + 2 \vec \omega \times \vec v_r + \vec \omega \times \left ( \vec \omega \times \vec r \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Moving things to the other side, but reversing one cross-product in each term, you find:

:&lt;math&gt; \vec a_r = \vec a_i + 2 \vec v_r \times \vec \omega + \vec \omega \times \left ( \vec r \times \vec \omega \right )&lt;/math&gt;

This tells us that &lt;math&gt;\vec a_r&lt;/math&gt;, the acceleration of some object at &lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt; as observed by someone at rest in the rotating frame is equal to the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\vec a_i&lt;/math&gt;, as observed by an observer in the inertial, non-rotating frame, plus &lt;math&gt;2 \vec v_r \times \vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[coriolis effect]]'s contribution to the acceleration, and &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega \times \left ( \vec r \times \vec \omega \right )&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[centrifugal force]] term.

== Fictitious centrifugal force ==
An alternative way of dealing with a rotating frame of reference is to make Newton's laws of motion artificially valid in it by adding fictitious forces that are pretended to be the cause of the above acceleration terms. In particular, the centrifugal acceleration is added to the motion of every object, and attributed to a fictitious centrifugal force, given by:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\mathrm{centrifugal} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= m \mathbf{a}_\mathrm{centrifugal} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object.

This centrifugal force is a sufficient correction to Newton's second law only if the body is stationary in the rotating frame. For bodies that move with respect to the rotating frame it must be supplemented with a fictitious [[Coriolis force]]. For example, a body that is stationary relative to the ''non''-rotating frame, will be rotating when viewed from the rotating frame. The ''centripetal'' force of &lt;math&gt;-m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp&lt;/math&gt; required to account for this apparent rotation is the sum of the centrifugal force (&lt;math&gt;m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;) and the Coriolis force (&lt;math&gt;-2m \mathbf{\omega \times v} = -2m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;). Since this centripetal force includes contributions from only fictitious forces, it has no reactive counterpart.

=== Potential energy of the fictitious centrifugal force ===
The fictitious centrifugal force can be described by a [[potential energy]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;E_p = -\frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r_\perp^2&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful, for example, in calculating the form of the water surface &lt;math&gt;h(r)\,&lt;/math&gt; in a rotating bucket: requiring the potential energy per unit mass on the surface &lt;math&gt;gh(r) - \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 r^2\,&lt;/math&gt; to be constant, we obtain the [[parabolic]] form &lt;math&gt;h(r) = \frac{\omega^2}{2g}r^2 + C&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant).

Similarly, the potential energy of the centrifugal force is often used in the calculation of the height of the [[tide]]s on the Earth (where the centrifugal force is included to account for the rotation of the Earth around the Earth-Moon center of mass).

The principle of operation of the [[centrifuge]] also can be simply understood in terms of this expression for the potential energy, which shows that it is favorable energetically when the volume far from the axis of rotation is occupied by the heavier substance.

==Centrifugal forces in statics==
Consider a ball that swings around a stationary pivot to which it is [[Tetherball|tethered]] by a light, strong rope. There is tension in the rope, pulling inwards on the ball (the centripetal force) and simultaneously pulling outwards on the pivot (the reactive centrifugal force). The tension is real, so these two forces still exist if we move to a corotating frame. However, in the rotating frame there is also a fictitious centrifugal force that pulls outwards on the ''ball''. It is distinct from the reactive centrifugal force that pulls outward on the ''pivot''.

When solving [[statics]] problems in a rotating frame (e.g. when calculating the internal stresses in a [[flywheel]]) it is convenient to think of the fictitious centrifugal force as being transmitted through the rope and ''becoming'' the pull on the pivot. In statics one often considers a force &quot;the same&quot; before and after it has been conveyed by a structural element, so according to this view the reaction force on the pivot ''is'' the fictitious force.

This identification often leads to confusion about the &quot;fictitious&quot; nature of the centrifugal force, because the pull on the pivot is a perfectly real force. The confusion can be resolved by noting that the distinction between fictitious and real forces depends on the frame of reference that one chooses for the laws of physics. On the other hand, considering the reaction force to ''be'' the fictitious force is only valid in [[statics]], that is, once we have decided to always use that particular reference frame in which the entire system is stationary. The convenience of viewing a transmitted force as the same as the original force comes at the cost of a meaningful distinction between whether a force is real or fictitious.

==Confusion and misconceptions==
Centrifugal force can be a confusing term because it is used (or misused) in more than one instance, and because sloppy labeling can obscure which forces are acting upon which objects in a system (which is true for physics in general). When diagramming forces in a system, one must describe each object separately, attaching only those forces acting ''upon'' it (not forces that it ''exerts'' upon other objects).

One can avoid dealing with fictitious forces entirely by analyzing systems using only [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]]. This is not necessarily the simplest approach, however: [[weather forecasting]] is made considerably simpler by always remaining within the rotating frame of the Earth, and taking the fictitious [[Coriolis effect]] as given.

Because rotating frames are not vital for understanding mechanics, science teachers often de-emphasize the fictitious centrifugal force that arises in a rotating reference frame. However, in their zeal to stamp out the misunderstanding of the term in this one case, they may try to expunge it from the language entirely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An object that moves in a [[rotation|circular path]] undergoes a continuous [[acceleration]] towards the center of the circle. The [[net force]] that causes this acceleration is called a
'''centripetal force''' (from [[Latin]] ''centrum'' &quot;center&quot; and ''petere'' &quot;tend towards&quot;). This term refers to the ''effect'' of the force (namely, to maintain the circular motion of the object); the ''origin'' of the centripetal force can be anything that causes a [[force]] to exist. An object can travel in a circle with a constant [[speed]] only if the [[net force]] acting on it is a centripetal force. (And if the object is traveling in a circle with a varying [[speed]], the component of the [[net force]] along the [[radius]] is the centripetal force.)

In the case of an orbiting [[satellite]], the centripetal force is supplied by the gravitational attraction between the satellite and its primary, and acts toward the center of mass which lies in the satellite's primary; in the case of an object at the end of a rope rotating about a [[vertical]] [[axis of rotation|axis]], the centripetal force is the [[horizontal]] component of the tension of the rope which acts towards the [[axis of rotation]]. In the case of a spinning object, internal [[tensile stress]] gives the centripetal force that keeps the objects together in one piece.

Centripetal force must not be mixed up with [[centrifugal force]]. In an [[inertial reference frame]] (not rotating or accelerating), the centripetal force accelerates a particle in such a way that it moves along a circular path. In a corotating [[reference frame]], a particle in circular motion appears to have zero velocity, if the rotation is not accounted for. The centripetal force is exactly cancelled by a centrifugal force that in this approach appears as a [[fictitious force]]. Centripetal forces are according to Newtonian mechanics true forces, while centrifugal forces only appear relative to rotating frames. 

Centripetal force must not be confused with [[central force]] either. 

Objects moving in a straight line with constant speed also have constant [[velocity]]. However, an object moving in an arc with constant speed has a changing direction of motion. As velocity is a vector of speed and direction, a changing direction implies a changing velocity. The rate of this change in velocity is the '''centripetal acceleration'''. [[Derivative|Differentiating]] the velocity vector gives the direction of this acceleration towards the center of the circle.

== Formula ==
The centripetal acceleration is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_c = - \frac{v^2}{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} = - \frac{v^2}{r} \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} = - \omega^2 \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Newton's second law of motion]], as there is an [[acceleration]] there has to be a [[force]] in the direction of the acceleration. This is the centripetal force, and is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_c = - \frac{m v^2}{r} \hat{\mathbf{r}} = - \frac{m v^2}{r} \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} = - m \omega^2 \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

''(where m is mass, v is velocity, r is radius of the circle, and the minus sign denotes that the vector points to the center of the circle and &amp;omega; = v / r is the [[angular velocity]])''.
In vector notation we can write:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol F_c = m \boldsymbol\omega \times   (\boldsymbol\omega \times   \boldsymbol r )&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity vector of the rotation and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol r&lt;/math&gt; is a vector from an arbitrary point on the rotation axis to the body (with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;).

== Derivation ==
Simply use a [[polar coordinate system]], assume a constant radius, and differentiate twice. 

Let '''r'''(t) be a vector that describes the position of a [[point mass]] as a function of time. Since we are assuming uniform [[circular motion]], let '''r'''(t) = R&amp;middot;'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, where R is a constant (the radius of the circle) and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[unit vector]] pointing from the origin to the point mass. In terms of Cartesian unit vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;u_r = cos(\theta)u_x + sin(\theta)u_y \, &lt;/math&gt;

''Note: unlike in [[cartesian coordinates]] where the unit vectors are constants, in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]] the direction of the unit vectors depend on the angle between the x_axis and the point being described; the angle &amp;theta;.''

So we differentiate to find velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;v = R \frac {du_r}{dt} \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v = R \frac{d\theta}{dt} u_\theta \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v = R \omega u_\theta \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;omega; is the angular velocity (just a short way of writing d&amp;theta;/dt), '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; is the unit vector that is perpendicular to '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; that points in the direction of increasing &amp;theta;. In cartesian terms:  '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; = -sin(&amp;theta;) '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + cos(&amp;theta;) '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;

This result for the velocity is good because it matches our expectation that the velocity should be directed around the circle, and that the magnitude of the velocity should be &amp;omega;R. Differentiating again, we find that the acceleration, '''a''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;a = R \left( \frac {d\omega}{dt} u_\theta - \omega^2 u_r \right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the radial component of the acceleration is:

:&lt;math&gt;a_r = -\omega^2 R \, &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about checksums calculated using addition.  The term &quot;checksum&quot; is sometimes used in a more general sense to refer to any kind of [[redundancy check]].  Checksums on decimal numbers are discussed under [[check digit]].''

A '''checksum''' is a form of [[redundancy check]], a very simple measure for protecting the integrity of data by [[error detection|detecting errors]] in data that is sent through space ([[telecommunication]]s) or time ([[Computer storage|storage]]).  It works by adding up the basic components of a message, typically the [[byte]]s, and storing the resulting value. Later, anyone can perform the same operation on the data, compare the result to the authentic checksum, and (assuming that the sums match) conclude that the message was probably not corrupted.

The simplest form of checksum, which simply adds up the bytes in the data, cannot detect a number of types of errors. In particular, such a checksum is not changed by:
* reordering of the bytes in the message 
* inserting or deleting zero-valued bytes
* multiple errors that cancel out each other

More sophisticated types of redundancy check, including [[Fletcher's checksum]], [[Adler-32]], and [[cyclic redundancy check]]s (CRCs), are designed to address these weaknesses by considering not only the value of each byte but also its position. The cost of the ability to detect more types of error is the increased [[complexity]] of computing the checksum.

These types of redundancy check are useful in detecting ''accidental'' modification such as corruption to stored data or errors in a communication channel. However, they provide no security against a malicious agent as their simple [[mathematical structure]] makes them trivial to circumvent. To provide this level of integrity, the use of a [[cryptographic hash function]], such as [[SHA-256]], is necessary.  (Collisions have been found in SHA-1, currently the most popular choice, but there is no evidence as of 2005 that SHA-256 suffers similar weaknesses.)

On [[Unix|UNIX]] there is a tool called &quot;cksum&quot; that generates both a 32 bit CRC and a byte count for any given input file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cunylogo.jpg|right]]
The '''City University of New York''' (CUNY; [[acronym]] usually pronounced &quot;kyoo-nee&quot; or &quot;coo-nee&quot;), located in [[New York City]], is the largest urban university in the [[United States]], with more than 198,000 enrolled in degree programs, about 20,000 enrolled in non-degree programs and more than 200,000 enrolled in adult and continuing education courses at campuses in all five boroughs.  It is the third-largest university system, in terms of enrollment, in the [[United States]], behind the [[State University of New York]] system and the [[California State University]] system.

CUNY and the [[State University of New York]] are entirely different university systems, despite the fact that both are public institutions which receive funding from New York State.

== History ==

CUNY's history dates back to the formation of the Free Academy in [[1847]]. The school was fashioned as &quot;a Free Academy for the purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the &amp;#8230;city and county of New York.&quot; The Free Academy later became The City College, the first CUNY college. From this grew a system of seven senior colleges, four hybrid schools, six community colleges, as well as graduate schools and professional programs. CUNY was established in [[1961]] as the umbrella institution of the municipal colleges of New York City.

== Structure ==

The City University is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of 17 members, ten of whom are appointed by the Governor of [[New York]] &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate,&quot; and five by the Mayor of New York City &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate.&quot; One trustee is the chair of the university's student senate, and finally, one trustee, without a vote, is the chair of the university's faculty senate. Both the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to include at least one resident of each of New York City's five boroughs. Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years. College presidents report directly to the Board.

The Chancellor is voted upon by the Board of Trustees, and is the &quot;chief educational and administrative officer&quot; of the City University. 

Unlike other state college systems, CUNY does not operate as a central authority to the colleges and, in fact, the central administration has limited power over the colleges. This is partly because most of the senior colleges (namely Brooklyn, Hunter, Queens, and City) predate CUNY and were thus established by mandate of the New York State Legislature, which has institutionalized the autonomy of the colleges. College presidents and faculty typically view CUNY as a loose confederation rather than a unified system.  Nevertheless, in recent years and at the behest of the Governor and the Mayor, the Board of Trustees and the Chancellor have, through the power of the purse, succeeded in weakening the college presidents and faculty and consolidating executive powers to themselves.

== Colleges ==

CUNY consists of three different types of institutions: senior colleges, which grant bachelor's degrees and occasionally master's and associates degrees; community colleges, which grant associate's degrees; and graduate/professional schools. CUNY's Law School grants juris doctor (J.D.) degrees, and Ph.D. degrees are awarded only by the CUNY Graduate Center.

The colleges are listed below, with establishment dates in parentheses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer science]], '''computational complexity theory''' is the branch of the [[theory of computation]] that studies the resources, or ''cost'', of the computation required to solve a given problem.  This cost is usually measured in terms of abstract parameters such as time and space.  ''Time'' represents the number of steps it takes to solve a problem and ''space'' represents the quantity of information storage required or how much memory it takes.  There are often tradeoffs between time and space that have to be considered when trying to solve a computational problem.  It often turns out that an alternative algorithm will require less time but more space (or vice versa) to solve a given problem.  Time requirements sometimes must be amortized to determine the time cost for a well defined average case.  Space requirements can be profiled over time, too, especially in consideration of a multi-user computer system.

Other resources can also be considered, such as how many [[parallel processor]]s are needed to solve a problem in parallel.  In this case, &quot;parallelizable time&quot; and &quot;non-parallelizable time&quot; are considered.  The latter is important in real-time applications, and it gives a limit to how far the computation can be parallelized.  Some steps must be done sequentially because they depend on the results of previous steps.

Complexity theory differs from [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], which deals with whether a problem can be solved at all, regardless of the resources required.

==Overview==
After the theory explaining which problems can be solved and which cannot be, it was natural to ask about the relative computational difficulty of [[computable function]]s. This is the subject matter of computational complexity.

A single &quot;problem&quot; is an entire set of related questions, where each question is a finite-length [[string (computer science)|string]].  For example, the problem [[integer factorization|''FACTORIZE'']] is:  given an integer written in [[binary number|binary]], return all of the [[prime number|prime]] factors of that number.  A particular question is called an ''instance''.  For example, &quot;give the factors of the number 15&quot; is one instance of the ''FACTORIZE'' problem. 

The '''time complexity''' of a problem is the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient [[algorithm]]. To understand this intuitively, consider the example of an instance that is ''n'' bits long that can be solved in ''n''² steps.  In this example we say the problem has a time complexity of ''n''².  Of course, the exact number of steps will depend on exactly what machine or language is being used.   To avoid that problem, we generally use [[Big O notation]].  If a problem has time complexity O(''n''²) on one typical computer, then it will also have complexity O(''n''²p(n)) on most other computers for some polynomial p(n), so this notation allows us to generalize away from the details of a particular computer.

'''Example:''' Mowing grass has linear complexity because it takes double the time to mow double the area.
However, looking up something in a dictionary has only logarithmic complexity because a double sized dictionary only has to be opened one time more (e.g. exactly in the middle - then the problem is reduced to the half).

==Decision problems==
Much of complexity theory deals with decision problems.  A [[decision problem]] is a problem where the answer is always YES/NO.  For example, the problem ''IS-PRIME'' is:  given an integer written in binary, return whether it is a prime number or not.  A decision problem is equivalent to a ''language'', which is a set of finite-length strings.  For a given decision problem, the equivalent language is the set of all strings for which the answer is YES.

Decision problems are often considered because an arbitrary problem can always be reduced to a decision problem.  For example, the problem ''HAS-FACTOR'' is: given integers ''n'' and ''k'' written in binary, return whether ''n'' has any prime factors less than ''k''.  If we can solve ''HAS-FACTOR'' with a certain amount of resources, then we can use that solution to solve ''FACTORIZE'' without much more resources.  Just do a [[binary search]] on ''k'' until you find the smallest factor of ''n''.  Then divide out that factor, and repeat until you find all the factors.  

Complexity theory often makes a distinction between YES answers and NO answers.
For example, the set NP is defined as the set of problems where the YES instances can be checked &quot;quickly&quot; (i.e. in polynomial time).  The set Co-NP is the set of problems where the NO instances can be checked quickly.  The &quot;Co&quot; in the name stands for &quot;complement&quot;.  The ''[[complement (complexity)|complement]]'' of a problem is one where all the YES and NO answers are swapped, such as ''IS-COMPOSITE'' for ''IS-PRIME''.

An important result in complexity theory is the fact that no matter how hard a problem can get (i.e. how much time and space resources it requires), there will always be even harder problems. For time complexity, this is determined by the [[time hierarchy theorem]]. A similar [[space hierarchy theorem]] can also be derived.

==Complexity classes==
The [[Complexity class|complexity class]] [[P (complexity)|P]] is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[Deterministic Turing machine|deterministic machine]] in polynomial time.  This class corresponds to an intuitive idea of the problems which can be effectively solved in the worst cases.

The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[Non-deterministic_Turing_machine|non-deterministic machine]] in polynomial time.  This class contains many problems that people would like to be able to solve effectively, including the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[Vertex cover problem]].  All the problems in this class have the property that their solutions can be checked effectively.

Many complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].

==The P&lt;nowiki&gt; = &lt;/nowiki&gt;NP question==
The question of whether P is the same set as NP is the most important open question in theoretical computer science.  There is even a [[Clay Mathematics Institute|$1,000,000 prize]] for solving it.  (See '''[[complexity classes P and NP]]''' and '''[[oracle machine|oracles]]''').

Questions like this motivate the concepts of ''hard'' and ''complete''.  A set of problems ''X'' is hard for a set of problems ''Y'' if every problem in ''Y'' can be transformed easily into some problem in ''X'' with the same answer.  The definition of &quot;easily&quot; is different in different contexts.  The most important hard set is [[NP-hard]].  Set ''X'' is complete for ''Y'' if it is hard for ''Y'', and is also a subset of ''Y''.  The most important complete set is [[NP-complete]].  See the articles on those two sets for more detail on the definition of &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;complete&quot;.

==Intractability==
Problems that are [[Decidability|solvable in theory]], but can't be solved in practice, are called ''intractable''. What can be solved &quot;in practice&quot; is open to debate, but in general only problems that have polynomial-time solutions are solvable for more than the smallest inputs. Problems that are known to be intractable include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-complete. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable.

To see why exponential-time solutions are not usable in practice, consider a problem that requires 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; operations to solve (n is the size of the input). For a relatively small input size of n=100, and assuming a computer that can perform 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (10 [[giga]]) operations per second, a solution would take about 4*10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; years, much longer than the current [[age of the universe]].

'''Camelot''' is the name of the [[castle|stronghold]] of the [[legend]]ary [[King Arthur]], from which he fought many of the battles that made up his life. Its specific location is currently unknown and may be a fictionalized [[Romano-British]] province of post-Roman Britain. The city is first named in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' poem ''[[Lancelot]]'', where it does not seem as important as it would become in Arthurian legend. Since the location of Camelot is still a mystery, the truth about it&amp;mdash;if there is one&amp;mdash;is still unknown.

==Geographical references==
Possible locations of Camelot include:
* Saltwell Park, in [[Gateshead]]
* [[Cadbury Castle]]
* [[Tintagel Castle]]
* [[Viroconium]] 
* [[Caerleon]]-on-Usk, in South Wales 
* [[Dinerth Castle]] near the River Arth, West Wales

Though the name &quot;Camelot&quot; may be derived from [[Camulodunum]] (modern Colchester), the stronghold of the [[Catuvellauni]] kings, and later the provincial capital of Roman Britannia, its Essex location (in East Anglia) places it in the wrong Anglo-Saxon kingdom.

==In popular culture==
The phrase 'Camelot' is often used to refer to the period in [[United States history|US history]] of [[1960]]-[[1963]]. More specifically, it refers to the presidency of [[John F. Kennedy]], as his term was said to have a lot of potential and promise for the future and the period was idyllic for many in the world, encouraged by Kennedy. The period was ended by Kennedy's tragic assassination, which is often compared to the fall of King Arthur. The line &quot;Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot&quot; from the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', has been used in pop culture to refer to this period. 

The Camulod Chronicles by [[Jack Whyte]] is a historical fiction series based on Roman Britain and Medieval Britain wrapped around the Arthurian legends.

In the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Camelot is called a &quot;silly place&quot; by [[Graham Chapman|King Arthur]], and the [[Knights of the Round Table]] decide not to go there.

In the television show, ''[[Third Watch]]'', the precinct is nicknamed by the officers &quot;Camelot&quot; due to its location on the corner of King and Arthur.

The musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]], is loosely based on the legend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For other uses of the word or name, see'' [[Contra (disambiguation)]]

The '''Contras''' (from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''La Contra'', short for movement of the ''contrarrevolucionarios'', meaning counter-revolutionaries) were the armed opponents of [[Nicaragua]]'s  [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] following the July [[1979]] overthrow of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] and the ending of the Somoza family's 43-year rule. The label was commonly used by the US press to cover a range of groups opposed to the Sandinistas, with little in the way of ideological unity; thus some references use the uncapitalized form, '''contra''', which means against or counter in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. 

The Contras were considered [[terrorism|terrorists]] by the Sandinistas, who alleged their attacks targeted civilians. The Contras, who initially received financial and other forms of support from the Argentine military regime and then U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], mounted raids which targeted northern Nicaragua, particularly coffee plantations and farming cooperatives. They received sympathy and support from Nicaraguan peasants opposed to the Sandinistas' [[nationalization]] of their land, formation of large farming co-ops, and mistreatment of dissenters; however, they were also opposed by Nicaraguans and [[human rights]] groups who viewed their tactics as brutal and indiscriminate. According to human rights group [[Americas Watch]], the Contras engaged in &quot;violent abuses ... so prevalent that these may be said to be their principal means of waging war.&quot;

==History==
The earliest were MILPAS, peasant militias led by former Sandinista supporters. These militias were the majority of the first true Contra groups formed in [[1980]]-[[1981]] in [[Honduras]], Nicaragua's northern neighbour, allying in August 1981 as the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (''Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense'', FDN) under the command of former [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] (army) colonel [[Enrique Bermudez|Enrique Bermúdez]] and [[Jaime Irving Steidel]] a [[Honduras|Honduran]]-born Field Commander, later replaced by Oscar Sobalvarro. A joint political directorate was created in February [[1983]] under businessman and anti-Sandinista politician [[Adolfo Calero]].

A second front in the war opened with the creation in [[Costa Rica]] in April [[1982]] of the [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]] (ARDE) and its armed wing, the Sandino Revolutionary Front (FRS), by [[Edén Pastora]] (''Comandante Cero''), former Sandinista hero of the August 1978 seizure of Somoza's palace. ARDE was formed by [[Sandinista]] dissidents and veterans of the anti-Somoza campaign who opposed the increased influence of [[Cuba]]n officials in the [[Managua]] regime.  Proclaiming his ideological distance from the FDN, Pastora nevertheless styled his force the &quot;southern front&quot; in a common campaign. 

A third anti-Sandinista force, [[Misurasata]], appeared among the [[Miskito]], [[Sumu]] and [[Rama]] [[Amerindian]] peoples of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the revolutionary authorities following what the [[Sandinista]] government later called an &quot;ill-judged modernisation drive,&quot; and what the Miskitos themselves called [[genocide]]. In [[1983]] the Misurasata movement led by Brooklyn Rivera split, the breakaway [[Misura]] group of Stedman Fagoth allying itself more closely with the FDN. 

The Misurasata did not consider the actions of the [[Sandinista]] government as just an &quot;ill-judged modernisation drive&quot;, but an attempt to force the tribes to participate in the revolution. The Misurasata had a number of grievances against the [[Sandinista]] government including:

* Unilateral natural resource exploitation policies which denied Indians access to much of their traditional land base and severely restricted their subsistence activities 
* The arrest, imprisonment and subsequent execution of the majority of the Misurasata leadership
* The military occupation, bombing, or deliberate destruction of over half of all Miskito and Sumu villages in the region, and the forced conscription of Indian youth into the Nicaraguan military
* Forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians from their traditional lands to relocation and re-education centers in the interior of the country, and subsequent burning of their villages 
* Economic embargoes and blockades against native villages not sympathetic to the government

U.S. officials were also active in drawing the various Contra groups together in [[June 1985]] as the United Nicaraguan Opposition under the leadership of Calero, Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo, all former members of the original Sandinista cadre: after its dissolution early in [[1987]], the Nicaraguan Resistance (RN) was organised along similar lines (May 1987). Splits within the rebel movement emerged with Pastora's defection (May 1984) and Misurasata's April 1985 accommodation with the Sandinista government: a subsequent autonomy statute (September 1987) largely defused Miskito resistance. 

Mediation by other Central American governments under Costa Rican leadership led finally to the Sapoa ceasefire agreement of [[March 23]], [[1988]], which with additional agreements (February, August 1989) provided for the Contras' disarmament and re-integration into Nicaraguan society and politics, and internationally-monitored elections which were subsequently won ([[February 25]], [[1990]]) by an anti-Sandinista centre-right coalition. 

Some Contra elements and disaffected Sandinistas returned briefly to armed opposition in the [[1990s]], sometimes calling themselves ''recontras'' or ''revueltos'', but these groups were subsequently persuaded to disarm again.

== U.S. military &amp; financial assistance ==

''See also the [[Iran-Contra affair]]''

A key role in the development of the Contra alliance was played by the [[United States]] following [[Ronald Reagan]]'s assumption of the presidency in January [[1981]]. Reagan accused the [[Sandinista]]s of importing Cuban-style [[socialism]] and aiding [[FMLN|leftist guerrillas]] in [[El Salvador]]. On [[November 23]] of that year, Reagan signed the [[top secret]] National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17), giving the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] the authority to recruit and support the Contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the Contras was one component of the so-called [[Reagan Doctrine]], championed by American [[conservative]]s, which called for providing U.S. military support to movements opposing [[Soviet Union|Soviet-supported]], communist-led governments.

In [[1984]] Nicaragua filed a suit in the [[International Court of Justice]] against the United States in [[Nicaragua v. United States]], which in [[1986]] resulted [http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/icases/inus/inus_isummaries/inus_isummary_19860627.htm] in a guilty verdict against the US, calling on it to &quot;cease and to refrain&quot; from the unlawful use of force against Nicaragua through placement of underwater mines by CIA operatives and training, funding and support of the guerrilla forces. The US was &quot;in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another state&quot; and was ordered to pay reparations (see note 1). The US response to this ruling was to dismiss the jurisdiction of the court, holding that its power did not supersede the Constitution, and escalate the war, besides pointing out that the court did not take in consideration the alleged role Nicaragua played as a [[Cold War]] proxy in a purported Soviet offensive.

After direct military aid was interrupted by the [[Boland Amendment]] (passed by the U.S. Congress in December 1982 and extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] but all U.S. government agencies), Administration officials sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of third-parties, culminating in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1986-1987. 

On [[February 3]], [[1988]] the [[United States House of Representatives]] rejected President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s request for $36.25 million to aid the Contras.

Senator [[John Kerry]]'s [[1988]] [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] report on Contra-drug links concluded that &quot;senior U.S. policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras' funding problems.&quot; [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/index.htm] According to the [[National Security Archive]], [[Oliver North]], a main character of the [[Irangate|Iran-Contra affair]], had been in contact with [[Manuel Noriega]], Panama's drug-lord, whom he personally met.

The [[Reagan administration]]'s support for the Contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s. In [[August 1996]], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' reporter [[Gary Webb]] published a series titled ''Dark Alliance'' [http://www.narconews.com/darkalliance/drugs/start.htm], allegedly linking the origins of [[crack cocaine]] in California to the Contras. [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm] Webb's controversial and highly damaging revelations were disputed at the time; subsequent revelations largely confirmed some of his findings. [[Freedom of Information Act]] inquiries by the National Security Archive and other investigators unearthed a number of documents showing that White House officials, including Oliver North, knew about and supported using money raised via [[drug trafficking]] to fund the Contras. Sen. John Kerry's report in 1988 came to the same conclusions.[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/north06.pdf]   However, major media outlets and the Justice Department denied the allegations.

'''John Craig Venter''' (born [[October 14]], [[1946]], [[Salt Lake City]]) is an American [[biologist]] and businessman.  He began his academic career at a [[community college]], [[College of San Mateo]] (California), after enlisting in the [[United States Navy|navy]] and serving a tour of duty during the [[Vietnam War]]. On returning, he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[biochemistry]] in [[1972]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] in [[1975]], both from the [[University of California, San Diego]]. After working at the [[University at Buffalo|State University of New York at Buffalo]], he joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1984.

While at NIH, Venter learned of a technique for rapidly identifying all of the [[mRNA]]s present in a cell, and began to use it to rapidly identify human brain genes.  The short [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence fragments discovered by this method are called [[Expressed sequence tag]]s, or ESTs, a name coined by Anthony Kerlavage at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]].  In a controversial court case, Venter tried to patent these gene fragments and lost the case.

He was the former president and founder of [[Celera Genomics]], which became famous for running a [[Human Genome Project]] of its own for commercial purposes, using [[shotgun sequencing]] technology in [[1999]]. [[DNA]] from 5 individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the 5 individuals used in this project was Venter.  Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002 after it became clear that selling genome data would not become profitable and Venter resisted efforts by the company board to change the strategic direction of the company.

Venter founded [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) in [[1992]].  Venter is currently the president of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], created and funded by TIGR's board (which Venter chairs). In June of 2005, he co-founded [[Synthetic Genomics]], a firm dedicated to using modified [[microorganisms]] to produce [[ethanol]] and [[hydrogen]] as [[alternative fuel|alternative fuels]].

Venter has been the subject of several articles, notably in ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' in [[December 2004]], and Australian science magazine [[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]] in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chemical evolution''' has two meanings and uses. The first refers to the theories of evolution of the [[chemical element]]s in the universe following the [[Big Bang]] and through [[nucleosynthesis]] in [[star]]s and [[supernova]]s.

The second use of '''chemical evolution''' or ''chemosynthesis'' is as a hypothesis to explain how [[life]] might possibly have developed or evolved from non-life (see [[abiogenesis]]). Various experiments have been made to show certain aspects of this process, the first ones were done by [[Stanley L. Miller]] in the [[1950s]]. For that they are now called [[Miller experiment]]s. However only very basic organic building blocks were obtained. The challenge is getting complex molecules organized consistently.

The hypothesis is that simple chemical compounds could catalyze the creation of copies of themselves (somewhat similar to the formation of a [[crystal]] or [[polymer]]) in an environment rich with the necessary building block compounds or elements.  As these [[chemical replicators]] &quot;reproduce&quot;, they can be created with slightly different structures randomly, similar to biological [[mutation]]s.  Eventually these replicators would produce [[protocell]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Carl Ransom Rogers''' ([[January 8]], [[1902]] &amp;ndash; [[February 4]], [[1987]]) was an influential American [[psychologist]], who, along with [[Abraham Maslow]], was the founder of the [[Humanistic psychology|humanist approach]] to [[psychology]]. He was also instrumental in the development of non-directive [[psychotherapy]], which he initially termed Client-Centered Therapy. He later renamed it as the ''Person-Centered Approach'' (PCA) to reflect that his theories were meant to apply to all interactions between people, not just to those between [[Psychotherapy|therapist]] and [[client]]. Today PCA is also called [[person-centered psychotherapy]].

==Biography==
Rogers was born in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]], a [[Chicagoland|Chicago suburb]]. His father was a [[civil engineer]] and his mother was a [[housewife]] and devout [[Christianity|Christian]]; Rogers was the fourth of six children. 

Rogers could read by kindergarten, and his education started in the second grade. Following an education in a strict religious and ethical environment, he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and an appreciation for the [[scientific method]] in a practical world.  His first career choice was [[agriculture]], followed by [[religion]].  At age 20, following his [[1922]] trip to [[Beijing]], [[China]], for an international Christian conference, he started to doubt his religious convictions.  To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled ''Why am I entering the [[Religious ministry (Christian)|Ministry]]?'', after which he decided to change career.

After two years he left the [[seminary]] and took his M.A. ([[1928]]) and his Ph.D. ([[1931]]) from [[Columbia University]]'s Teachers College.  While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in child study at the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], in [[Rochester, New York]], becoming the agency's director in [[1930]]. 

He was offered a full professorship at [[Ohio State University]] in [[1940]].  In [[1942]], he wrote his first book, ''[[Counseling and Psychotherapy]]''.  In it, Rogers suggested that the client, by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting [[therapist]], can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure his life. 

Then, in [[1945]], he was invited to set up a counseling center at the [[University of Chicago]].  It was while working there, in [[1951]], he published his major work, ''[[Client-Centered Therapy]]'', wherein he outlines his basic theory.  In [[1956]] Rogers became the first President of the [[American Academy of Psychotherapists]].  In [[1957]] he arrived at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]].  However, following several internal conflicts at the department of psychology at Wisconsin, Rogers became disillusioned with [[academia]].

In [[1964]], Rogers was selected '[[humanist]] of the year' by the [[American Humanist Association]], and he received an offer to join the staff of the [[Western Behavioral Studies Institute]] (WBSI) for research, which he accepted and then moved to [[La Jolla, California]].  He remained in La Jolla, doing therapy, speeches and writing until his sudden death 23 years later.

==Contributions to psychology==
'Rogerian psychotherapy' became widely influential, embraced for its [[humanistic]] approach.  Rogers  also made significant contributions to the field of [[adult education]], with his Experiential theory of learning.  Rogers maintained that all [[human being]]s have a natural desire to learn.  He defined two categories of learning: meaningless, or [[cognitive]] learning (e.g., memorizing multiplication tables) and significant, or [[experiential learning]] (applied knowledge which addresses the needs and wants of the learner).

Rogers' basic tenet was that if unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and [[empathic]] understanding, was present in any relationship (though he started out by focusing on counselor-client relationships), that growth and psychological healing would occur. According to Rogers, these tenets were both necessary and sufficient to create a relationship conducive to enhancing the client's [[psychological]] well being, by enabling the client to fully experience all of themselves. He saw one of the chief causes of mental, emotional and existential suffering as people not being able to accept or allow themselves to fully experience all of who they are&amp;mdash;which includes aspects that are not always socially acceptable.

Writing about the role of the clinician, he remarked that, &quot;In every respect in which we make an object of the person&amp;mdash;whether by diagnosing him, analyzing him, or perceiving him impersonally in a case history&amp;mdash;we stand in the way of our therapeutic goal. [...]  We are deeply helpful only when we relate as persons, when we risk ourselves as persons in the relationship, when we experience the other as a person in their own right.  Only then is there a meeting at a depth that dissolves the pain of aloneness in both client and therapist.&quot;

Rogers' idea of the fully functioning person involved the following qualities, which show marked similarities to [[Buddhist]] philosophy:

*&lt;u&gt;Openness to experience:&lt;/u&gt; The accurate perception of one's feelings and experience in the world

*&lt;u&gt;Existential living:&lt;/u&gt; Living in the present, rather than the past (''gone'') or the future (''yet to come'')

*&lt;u&gt;Organismic trusting:&lt;/u&gt; Trusting one's own thoughts and feelings as accurate; do what comes naturally

*&lt;u&gt;Experiential freedom:&lt;/u&gt; To acknowledge one's freedoms and take responsibility for one's own actions

*&lt;u&gt;Creativity:&lt;/u&gt; Full participation in the world, including contributing to others' lives

Rogers and some colleagues founded the '[[encounter group|Group Encounter]]' (for young people, managers etc.) and '[[Marriage Encounter]]' (ME).

==Quotes==
&quot;Experience is, for me, the highest authority.  The touchstone of validity is my own experience.  No other person's ideas, and none of my own ideas, are as authoritative as my experience.  It is to experience that I must return again and again, to discover a closer approximation to truth as it is in the process of becoming in me.  Neither the Bible nor the prophets -- neither Freud nor research --neither the revelations of God nor man -- can take precedence over my own direct experience.  My experience is not authoritative because it is infallible.  It is the basis of authority because it can always be checked in new primary ways.  In this way its frequent error or fallibility is always open to correction.&quot;  
Carl Rogers, from '''[[On Becoming a Person]]''

&quot;If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-intitiated learning.&quot;
Carl Rogers

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[physics]], the '''Casimir effect''' is a weak [[Force (physics)|force]] exerted between separate objects, which is not due to [[electric charge|charge]], [[gravity]], or exchange of [[particles]], but instead is due to [[resonance]] in the intervening space between the objects, of [[Zero point energy|all-pervasive energy fields]]. The force is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small, since it falls off rapidly with distance.

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik B. G. Casimir]] first proposed the existence of the force, and an experiment to detect it in [[1948]] while participating in research at [[Philips]] Research Labs. His classic form of the experiment uses a pair of [[electric charge|uncharged]] parallel metal plates in a vacuum, and has successfully demonstrated the force to within 15% of the predicted value according to Casimir's theory.

The [[van der Waals force]] between a pair of neutral [[atom]]s is a similar effect. In modern [[theoretical physics]], the Casimir effect plays an important role in the [[nucleon#Models of the nucleon|chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]], and in applied physics, it is becoming of increasing importance in development of the ever-smaller, miniaturised components of emerging [[microtechnology|micro-]] and [[nanotechnology|nano-]] technologies.

==Overview==
The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and [[dielectric]]s alter the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy of the [[electromagnetic field]]. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.

==Vacuum energy==
The Casimir effect is an outcome of [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a naïve sense, a field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate, and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point.  Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, as this picture shows, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure. All calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]], or [[polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, all of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is after all, &quot;empty&quot; in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is  

:&lt;math&gt;{E} = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \hbar \omega \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. The removal of this infinity presents a challenge for theoretical particle physics, and [[as of 2005]], there is no compelling explanation for how this infinity should be treated as essentially zero (as a non-zero value is essentially the [[cosmological constant]]; a large value causes trouble in [[cosmology]]).

==The Casimir effect==
[[Image:Casmir_plates.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Casmir forces on parallel plates.]]

Casimir's observation was that the [[second-quantized]], quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to sum the zero point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 corresponds to the fact that the zero-point energies are being summed (it is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar \omega/2&lt;/math&gt;). Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions. 

In particular, one may ask how the zero point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity.  Each energy level &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on the shape, and so one should write &lt;math&gt;E_n(s)&lt;/math&gt; for the energy level, and &lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by &lt;math&gt;\delta s&lt;/math&gt;, at point ''p''. That is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;F(p) = - \left. \frac{\delta \langle E(s) \rangle} {\delta s} \right\vert_p\,&lt;/math&gt;

Amazingly, this value is finite in many practical calculations.

==Casimir's calculation==
In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates a distance ''a'' apart.  In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, since the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the parallel plates lie in the x-y plane, the standing waves are

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,y,z,t) = e^{-i\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \sin \left( k_n z \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the [[polarization]] and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[wave vector]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and 

:&lt;math&gt;k_n = \frac{n\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

is the wave-vector perpendicular to the plates.  Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that &amp;psi; vanish on the metal plates. The energy of this wave is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = c \sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \frac{n^2\pi^2}{a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty A\omega_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave.  This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = \hbar 
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \omega_n 
\vert \omega_n\vert^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

In the end, the limit &lt;math&gt;s\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3.  The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s''=3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s''=0, where the expression is finite.  Expanding this, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
\frac{\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\pi^2} \sum_n \int_0^\infty 2\pi qdq  
\left \vert q^2 + \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \right\vert^{(1-s)/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;q^2 = k_x^2+k_y^2&lt;/math&gt; were introduced to turn the [[double integral]] into a single integral. The integral is easily performed, resulting in 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \frac{1}{3-s}
\sum_n \vert n\vert ^{3-s}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum may be understood to be the [[Riemann zeta function]], and so one has
 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = 
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A} = 
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \zeta (-3)&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\zeta(-3)=1/120&lt;/math&gt; and so one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = 
\frac {-\hbar c \pi^{2}}{3 \cdot 240 a^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

The Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

:&lt;math&gt;{F_c \over A} = -
\frac{d}{da} \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} =
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^2} {240 a^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (hbar, &amp;#8463;) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the two plates.

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; shows that the Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

==Measurement==
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Spaarnay at Philips in Eindhoven, in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment, with results in general agreement with theory.

The Casimir effect was measured in [[1997]] by [[Steve K. Lamoreaux]] of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and by [[Umar Mohideen]] of the [[University of California at Riverside]] and his colleague [[Anushree Roy]].  In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a [[sphere]] with a large [[radius of curvature]].

Further research has shown that, with materials of certain [[permittivity]] and [[permeability]], or with a certain configuration, the Casimir effect can be repulsive instead of attractive.

==Regularization==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] in the summations.  This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The [[heat kernel]] or [[exponential|exponentially]] regulated sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| 
\exp (-t|\omega_n|)&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit &lt;math&gt;t\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt; is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{C}{t^3} + finite\,&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity.   The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| 
\exp (-t^2|\omega_n|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, however, it is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well.  The [[zeta function regulator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n| |\omega_n|^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s''=4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s''=0.

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s''=0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[x-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', &quot;Theory of Continuous Media&quot;.)

==Generalities==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called &quot;[[virtual particle]]s&quot;.

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the [[chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]], the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon. 

==Analogies==
A similar analysis can be used to explain [[Hawking radiation]] that causes the slow &quot;[[evaporation]]&quot; of [[black holes]] (although this is generally explained as the escape of one particle from a virtual particle-antiparticle pair, the other particle having been captured by the black hole).

A macroscopic effect analogous to the Casimir effect was observed by [[18th century]] [[France|French]] sailors.  Where two ships are rocking from side to side in conditions with a strong swell but light wind, and the ships come closer together than roughly 40&amp;nbsp;m, destructive [[interference]] eliminates the swell between the ships.  The calm sea between the ships has a lower energy density than the swell to either side of the ships, creating a pressure that can push the ships closer together.  If they get too close together, the ships' rigging can become entangled.  As a countermeasure, a handbook from the early [[1800s]] recommends that each ship should send out a boat rowed by 10 to 20 sailors to physically pull the ships apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about monetary coins. For other meanings see: [[Coin (disambiguation)]]''
{{Numismatics}}
A '''coin''' is usually a piece of hard material, generally [[metal]] and usually in the shape of a [[disc]], which is issued by a government to be used as a form of [[money]].  Along with [[banknote]]s, coins make up the cash forms of all modern money systems.  Coins are usually used for lower-valued units, and banknotes are usually used for the higher values; also, in most money systems, the highest value coin is worth less than the lowest-value note. 

==Collecting coins==

See [[Coin collecting]] and [[Numismatics]] for more information on the collecting of coins, bank notes, [[token coins]] and [[Exonumia]].

==The value of a coin==

The market exchange value of a coin comes from its [[historic value]], and/or the [[intrinsic value]] of the component metal (for example [[gold coin]]s, [[silver coin]]s or [[platinum coin]]s).

However, in modern times, most coins are made of a [[base metal]] and their value comes strictly from their status as [[fiat money]]. This means that the value of the coin is decreed by government fiat rather than agreed by the people, which really makes it less a coin and more a [[Token (Numismatics)|token]] in the strictest sense.

To distinguish between these two types of coins, as well as from other forms of tokens which have been used as money, monetary scholars have defined three criteria that an object must meet to be a &quot;true coin&quot;.  These criteria are:

# It must be made of a valuable material, and trade for close to the market value of that material.
# It must be of a standardized weight and purity.
# It must be marked to identify the authority that guarantees the content.

By the above definition, the invention and first known usage of coins comes from the Kingdom of [[Lydia]] circa 643-630 B.C.  Under three generations of Lydian kings, the money of Lydia gradually moved from being lumps of [[electrum]] (a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold) to coins of a guaranteed weight and purity, marked with the seal of the King.  True coins also developed very close to this time frame in both [[India]] and [[China]].

The [[history of coins]] is a long and interesting one. For example, in 1979 and 1980, a Chinese architectural team excavating the region surrounding the ancient kingdom of [[Loulan]] discovered some [[Mesolithic]] stone [[tools]] and '''coins''' (see [[Loulan#Modern Chinese Expeditions|Loulan: Modern Chinese Expeditions]]).

==Coin debasement==

[[image:US_price_history.png|frame|[[United States|US]] price levels, 1800&amp;ndash;2000&lt;br&gt;Red line marks leaving silver standard]]

Throughout history, governments have been known to create more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often [[copper]] or [[nickel]]), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby ''&quot;debasing&quot;'' their money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible.  [[Debasement]] of money almost always leads to price [[inflation]] unless [[price control]]s are also instituted by the governing authority.  Some consider a classic example of this phenomenon to be the behavior of price levels in the [[United States]] since [[1964]] (the last year circulating [[United States Coin]]s were minted of 90 percent silver).  It should be remembered, however, that for most of the era of U.S. silver coinage, such coins were actually fiat money, because the value of silver was relatively low.   For example, in 1960, the silver in a dime was worth less than four cents.  It also should not be inferred that such debasement and inflation were unique to the U.S.  Virtually every other country debased their coinage too.  The United Kingdom saw similar inflation during the same era.   What is unique to the United States, among the developed countries, is that the U.S. has never revised its coinage system to accommodate this inflation, and as a result, coins in America today are scarcely regarded as &quot;money&quot; in any practical sense.  Increasingly common are coin counting machines which charge money to consumers for converting their &quot;coins&quot; into &quot;cash&quot;.

==Features of modern coinage==

The milled, or reeded, edges still found on many coins were originally designed to show that none of the valuable metal had been shaved off the coin.  Prior to the use of milled edges, circulating coins suffered from &quot;shaving,&quot; a common problem where unscrupulous persons would shave a small amount of precious metal from the edge of a circulating coin. Circulating unmilled British [[sterling silver]] coins were known to be shaved to almost half of their minted weight.  This form of debasement in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] England led to the formulation of [[Gresham's Law]]. The monarch would have to periodically recall, paying only bullion value of the silver, and re-mint circulating coins.

Traditionally the side of a coin carrying a bust of a monarch or other authority, or a [[national emblem]], is called the ''obverse'', or colloquially ''heads''. The back side is called the ''reverse'', or colloquially ''tails''. However, the rule is violated in some cases. [http://www.ucalgary.ca/~cns/euro.html] Another rule is that the side carrying the year of [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing is the obverse, although most [[Canada|Canadian]] coins, and all [[Japan]]ese coins, are an exception.

The orientation of the obverse with respect to the reverse differs between countries. Some coins have [[coin orientation]], where the coin must be flipped vertically to see the other side; other coins, such as British coins, have [[medallic orientation]], where the coin must be flipped horizontally to see the other side.

Coins that are not round (British [[British Fifty Pence coin|50 pence]] for example) usually have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This is so that the coin has a [[Curve of constant width|constant diameter]], and therefore will be recognised by machines whichever way it is inserted. If a coin had an even number of sides this would not be true.  Some older such designs remain, such as the [[dodecagon|12-sided]] [[Australian dollar|Australian 50 cent coin]].

Coins are popularly used as a sort of two-sided [[dice|die]]; in order to choose between two options with a random possibility, one choice will be labeled &quot;heads&quot; and the other &quot;tails,&quot; and a coin will be flipped or &quot;tossed&quot; to see whether the heads or tails side comes up on top. See [[Bernoulli trial]]; a fair coin is defined to have the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a &quot;success&quot;) of exactly 0.5. A widely publicized example of an asymmetrical coin is the [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian one euro coin]] [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1748].  See also [[coin flipping]].

Coins are sometimes falsified to make one side weigh more. Such a coin is often said to be &quot;weighted.&quot;

Some coins, called [[Bracteate|bracteates]], are so thin they can only be struck on one side.

Bi-metallic coins are used for comemorative purposes and in the 1990s,France used a tri-metallic coin.

Coins with guitar shapes were issued in Somalia this year.
Poland issued a fan-shaped 10 zloty coin but the oddest coin ever was the 2002 Nauru,Europe-shaped coin.

A '''cubewano''' is a [[Kuiper belt]] object, [[orbit]]ing beyond [[Pluto]] and not controlled by [[orbital resonance|resonances]] with [[Neptune]]. Cubewanos, called also ''Classical'' Kuiper Belt objects, have semi-major axes in 40-50 [[astronomical unit|AU]] range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune’s orbit.
  
The odd name is derived from the first [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian object]] found, {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}. Later objects were called &quot;QB1-o's&quot;, or cubewanos.

Objects identified as cubewanos include:

*{{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}
*{{mpl|2005 FY|9}} the largest known cubewano and one of the largest [[trans-Neptunian object]]s
*{{mpl|2003 EL|61}}, notable for its two moons and rapid rotation (3.9h) 
*[[(50000) Quaoar]]
*[[(20000) Varuna]]
*[[(19521) Chaos]]
*[[(53311) Deucalion]]
==Orbits==
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_55AU_Classical.svg|right|thumb|400px|Large cubewanos and [[plutino]]s.]]
Most classical Kuiper objects are found between the 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune (populated by [[plutino]]s) and the 1:2 resonance. The diagram illustrates larger cubewanos with [[semi-major axis]] on X axis. The [[eccentricity]] of the orbits is represented by red segments (extending from [[perihelion]] to [[aphelion]]) with [[inclination]] represented on Y axis. 

The largest [[plutino]]s ([[Pluto]], [[90482 Orcus]] and [[28978 Ixion]]) are also plotted for comparison (in grey). [[50000 Quaoar]], for example, has a typical, near circular (short red segment), close to the [[ecliptic]] orbit. Plutinos on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]] (marked as 1:1 resonance).

The majority of objects, so called '''cold''' population, have low inclination, near circular orbits. (the brightest: {{mp|1997 CS|29}}, {{mp|2001 QT|297}} and {{mp|2001 QS|322}} are shown on the diagram). A smaller population, named '''hot''', is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits&lt;ref&gt;D.Jewitt,A.Delsanti ''The Solar System Beyond The Planets'',to appear in the book ''Solar System Update'', Springer-Praxis Ed., Horwood, Blondel and Mason, 2006. [http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf Preprint version (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Distribution ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_55AU_ClassicalAndPlutinos.svg|right|thumb|400px|Distribution of cubewanos and [[plutino]]s.]]
The distribution of all known cubewanos (532 as of February, 2006) is plotted on the second diagram. The small inserts on the right show [[histogram]]s for orbit inclinations '''i''' (5° interval) and eccentricity '''e''' (interval 0.05).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 
The vast majority of objects (more than &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) have inclination &lt; 5° and eccentricity &lt;0.1. The distribution of semi-major axis '''a''', also shown, illustrates the preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.

The inserts on the left side of the diagram compare the populations of cubewanos and plutinos &lt;ref&gt;Minor Planet Circular 2005-X77 [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K05/K05X77.html Distant Minor planets] was used for plutinos' orbits classification. The updated data can be found in [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpec/K06/K06D28.html MPC 2006-D28].
&lt;/ref&gt; using eccentricity versus inclination plots. Each small square represents a given range for both the eccentricity '''e''' and the inclination '''i''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The relative population of objects within this range is represented with ‘cartographic’ colours (from small numbers plotted as green ''valleys'' to brown ''peaks''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The two populations are quite different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low inclination, near circular orbits (the low bottom corner ‘peak’). The parameters of plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in  0.15-0.2 range and low inclinations 5-10°. 
See also the comparison with [[scattered disk#Scattered objects versus classical objects|scattered disk objects]].

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Distribution of plutinos is plotted but excluded from cubewanos’ histograms.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;As near-circular orbits occupy the first column (e&lt;0.05) and the orbits with the lowest inclination (i&lt;5 degrees) occupy the lowest row, the square in the bottom left corner represents the number of near circular, very lowly inclined orbits.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;A grey square represents a  single object (an outlier) in this range.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
=== Orbit plots ===
[[Image:TheKuiperBelt_Projections_55AU_Classical_Plutinos.svg|left|thumb|240px|The orbits of [[plutino]]s and classical objects.]]
The graph on the left represents polar and ecliptic views of the (aligned) orbits of the classical objects (in blue) together with the plutinos (in red)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The solid blue ring, resulting from hundreds of overlapping orbits of the classical objects, fully deserves the name of the main (classical or cubewanos) '''belt'''. Unlike the classical objects with the orbits entirely outside, the plutinos approach, or even cross, the orbit of Neptune (in yellow).

On the ecliptic view, the yellow arc represents Neptune’s orbit (at ~30AU). The perihelia, typically inside Neptune’s orbit for the plutinos, and always safely outside for the cubewanos, are the distinctive attribute between the two families. Hot cubewanos can also be easily distinguished by their inclination, the plutinos typically keeping orbits below 20°. 

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;For roughly a half of known TNO the orbits are not yet known with the precision sufficient for the classification (a particularly delicate task for resonant objects).&lt;/small&gt;

A '''congressional-executive agreement''' is an agreement with a foreign power that has been approved by [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[United States]].  Unlike a [[treaty]], in the US constitutional sense of that term, it cannot cover matters normally outside the competence of the Federal government and does not require a two-thirds vote by the Senate, but rather is enacted as an ordinary law which requires majority votes by both the House and Senate followed by approval from the President. In contrast, a sole [[executive agreement]] is ratified by the [[President of the United States|President]] alone.

CEAs are often used to implement trade agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and United States accession to the [[World Trade Organization]].  It is used for this purpose because the requirement for two-thirds support in the Senate would make it difficult to ratify and implement these agreements, and it avoids the necessity for going to Congress twice for approval for foreign issues.

Some constitutional scholars, such as [[Laurence Tribe]], have argued that CEA's are unconstitutional as they circumvent the treaty ratification scheme outlined in the [[United States Constitution]].  The United States courts have rejected this argument, ruling that such agreements are not treaties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Christmas is the most widely celebrated and the most important holiday season in [[Poland]], full of rituals and merriment.
Unlike other [[Christian]] countries, a greater emphasis is placed on [[Wigilia]] ([[Christmas Eve]]) than Christmas Day.

Preparations for Christmas start with the [[Advent]]. This is an especially important time for religious [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]]. The week before Christmas is very hectic, full of bustle and preparation for the impending celebrations. Every house or apartment needs extra cleaning and sometimes redecoration. 

One must buy Christmas presents, food for the Christmas meals
and a [[Christmas tree]] (usually a fir tree) that is lavishly decorated and placed in a prominent part of the living room.

The Polish Christmas season is an occasion for family reunions;
everyone endeavours to spend the evening with their family.
Traditionally, the Christmas Eve feast begins with the appearance of the first star in the sky. Everybody gathers together and wishes one another breaking with everyone a special wafer. After the wishes the feast starts. 

Tradition states that a Christmas dinner should comprise twelve meals. This might seem excessive but because it is a fasting day all are rather hungry. 

Meat is avoided; rather, fish, pasta, sauerkraut, mushrooms and beans are consumed.

Usually after the meals are finished it is time for Christmas gifts.

At midnight many people go to a special [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in Roman Catholic churches called [[Pasterka]] (Shepherd's Mass).

The first day of Christmas is just celebrating in the family circle.

The second day of Christmas is for visiting friends and relatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Carousel''''' is a [[1945]] stage [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Richard Rodgers]] (music) and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] (book and lyrics) that was adapted from [[Ferenc Molnar]]'s play ''Liliom''. The original production, which was directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], opened at [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s [[Majestic Theatre]] on [[April 19]] [[1945]] and closed on [[May 24]] [[1947]] after playing 890 performances. The original cast included [[John Raitt]], [[Jan Clayton]], [[Jean Darling]], [[Eric Mattson]], [[Christine Johnson]], [[Murvyn Vye]], [[Bambi Linn]], and [[Russell Collins]].

{{spoiler}}

==Plot Synopsis==
===Act I===
Two young millworkers in freshly industrialized 1870s New England visit the town's carousel after work. One of them &amp;mdash; demure Julie Jordan &amp;mdash; shares a lingering glance and suggestive touch with the carousel's barker, Billy Bigelow. (song: &quot;Carousel Waltz&quot;)

Julie's friend Carrie Pipperidge presses her for information, but Julie is reticent about the encounter. (song: &quot;You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan&quot;) Eventually satisfied, Carrie confides that she has a beau of her own: local fisherman Enoch Snow (song: &quot;When I Marry Mister Snow&quot;).

A policeman appears and warns the women that Billy has taken money from other women. Carrie goes off, but Julie stays. She and Billy, now alone, can talk freely, but neither can quite confess the growing attraction they feel for each other. (song: &quot;If I Loved You&quot;)

Despite the incommunicative start, Julie and Billy are married shortly thereafter. When we next see them, Julie is confiding to Carrie that Billy, now unemployed, is unstable and occasionally violent. Carrie has news, too &amp;mdash; she and Mr. Snow are officially engaged (song: &quot;Mister Snow reprise&quot;) and looking forward to their idealized notion of married life (song: &quot;When The Children Are Asleep&quot;) As they and the town's other young folk prepare to attend a clambake, spitfire Carrie pokes fun at the local boys, cheered on by the local girls (song: &quot;Give It To 'Em Good, Carrie&quot;). Julie's cousin Nettie Fowler leads them all in a celebration of spring accompanied by an elaborate dance(song: &quot;June Is Bustin' Out All Over&quot;) before they leave for the clambake.

Meanwhile, Billy has fallen in with the unsavory sailor Jigger (song: &quot;Blow High, Blow Low&quot;), who tries to recruit him to help with a robbery. Billy is initially uninterested &amp;mdash; but then Julie tells him of her pregnancy. Overwhelmed by the news, and determined to provide for his future child, he decides to be Jigger's accomplice after all (song: &quot;Soliloquy&quot;).

===Act II===
After the clambake (song: &quot;A Real Nice Clambake&quot;), the townsfolk head back to town. Carrie's fiancé walks in on some innocent flirting between Carrie and Jigger, and declares, as Jigger jeers, that he is finished with her (song: &quot;Geraniums In The Window/Stonecutters Cut It On Stone&quot;). Julie, meanwhile, places her self-doubt aside and resolves to accept and love Billy as he is (song: &quot;What's The Use Of Wondrin'?&quot;).

Jigger and Billy play at cards, with the stakes being shares of the forecasted robbery spoils. Soon Billy has lost his entire stake in the robbery; the robbery is aborted; and Jigger escapes while Billy is caught. Billy falls on his knife and dies; Julie arrives too late to save him.

Nettie and the townsfolk comfort Julie (song: &quot;[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]&quot;), and we follow Billy to heaven. There, a pair of blunt-spoken angels explain that he must attempt to solve the problems he left behind (song: &quot;The Highest Judge Of All&quot;). They send him back down to earth, fifteen years after his suicide.
whas up
His and Julie's daughter, Louise, is now an angry and rebellious teen (song: &quot;Ballet: Pas de Deux&quot;). He manages to give her a small gift, and finally confess his love to Julie (song: &quot;If I Loved You reprise&quot;). Having thus made amends, he is there for her high-school graduation (song: &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone reprise&quot;) and wins entry to Heaven.

==History==

Both [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] said that ''Carousel'' was the favorite of their works together. They broke new ground in musical theater storytelling with their extended music/dialogue scenes, such as &quot;If I Loved You&quot; and, hauntingly, the &quot;Soliloquy&quot; (where Billy imagines his future child). The final anthem &quot;[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]&quot; has taken on a life of its own; a graduation standard, it is also customarily sung by fans at English football matches, especially those of [[Liverpool F.C.]]

A [[1956]] movie version starred [[Shirley Jones]] and [[Gordon MacRae]]. This movie also had an appearance by a young [[Cheryl Holdridge]], who would later gain fame on the [[Mickey Mouse Club]].  The movie also had an appearance by [[Jacques d'Amboise]], a principal dancer with the [[New York City Ballet]], as the charismatic carousel barker in the [[ballet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ContractLaw}}
A '''contract''' is a &quot;promise&quot; or an &quot;agreement&quot; that is enforced or recognised by the law. In the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], contracts are considered to be part of the general [[law of obligations]].  This article describes the law relating to contracts in [[common law]] jurisdictions.

== Comparison of contract and tort law ==
[[Law of obligations|The law of obligations]] has traditionally been divided into contractual obligations, which are ''voluntarily undertaken'' and ''owed to a specific person or persons'', and obligations in [[tort]] ''which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests'', primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons. 
Recently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff’s money or work [Beatson (1998)'' Anson’s Law of Contract'', 27th ed. (Oxford: OUP), pg. 21].

==Scope of common law contract law==
Basic [[common law]] contract law addresses four sets of issues:

#When and how is a contract formed?
#When may a party escape [[obligation]]s of a contract (such as a contract formed under [[duress]] or because of a misrepresentation)?
#What is the meaning and effect to be given to the terms of a contract?
#What is the remedy to be given for breach of a contract?    

'''Contract formation''':  There must be an agreement which consists of an [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] (see also [[consideration under English law]]) and contractual intention for a simple contract to exist: i.e. it is not a deed - otherwise no consideration is needed.

Subject to the ''sine qua non'' of Contract Formation, other ingredients that make up a contract include:

:* Form     - In some cases, certain formalities (that is, writing) must be observed.
:* [[Capacity (law)|Capacity]] - The parties must be legally capable of entering into a contract.
:*Consent   - The agreement must have been entered into freely.  Consent may be vitiated by duress or undue influence.
:* Legality - The purpose of the agreement must not be illegal or contrary to [[public policy]].

A contract which possesses all of the above ingredients is said to be valid.  The absence of an essential element will render the contract either void, voidable or unenforceable

In some situations, a [[collateral contract]] may exist.

'''Meaning and effect of contract terms''':  Many contract disputes involve a disagreement between the parties about what terms in the contract require each party to do or refrain from doing.  Hence, many rules of contract law pertain to interpretation of terms of a contract that are vague or ambiguous. The [[parol evidence rule]] limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract.

'''[[Privity]]:''' In general, only parties to a contract may sue for the breach of a contract.

==Validity of contracts==
For a contract to be [[valid]], it must meet the following criteria:

* '''Mutual agreement''' - (see main article [[offer and acceptance]]): There must be an express or implied agreement. The essential requirement is that there be evidence that the parties had each from an objective perspective engaged in conduct manifesting their assent, and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement. (Notice that the objective manifestation requirement means that one need not actually have assented so long as a reasonable person would believe that assent had been granted.) For a contract based on offer and acceptance to be enforced, the terms must be capable of determination in a way that it is clear that the parties assent was given to the same terms.  The terms, like the manifestation of assent itself, are determined objectively.

*'''Consideration''': There must be [[consideration]] (see also [[consideration under English law]]) given by all the parties, meaning that every party is conferring a benefit on the other party or himself sustaining a recognizable detriment, such as a reduction of the party's alternative courses of action where the party would otherwise be free to act with respect to the subject matter without any limitation. Consideration need not be adequate, e.g. agreeing to buy a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract. (q.v. Chappell &amp; Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd [1959] 2 All ER 701. (UK common law))

*'''Competent, Adult ([[Sui Juris]]) Parties''': Both parties must have the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to understand the terms of the contract they are entering into, and the consequences of the promises they make. For example, animals, minor children, and mentally disabled individuals do not have the capacity to form a contract, and any contracts with them will be considered [[Void contract|void]] or [[Voidable contract|voidable]]. Although [[corporation|corporations]] are technically [[legal fiction|legal fictions]], they are considered [[person|persons]] under the law, and thus fit to engage in contracts. 

:For adults, most jurisdictions have statutes declaring that the capacity of parties to a contract is presumed, so that one resisting enforcement of a contract on grounds that a party lacked the capacity to be bound bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of capacity.

*'''Proper Subject Matter''': The contract must have a [[lawful purpose]]. A contract to commit murder in exchange for money will not be enforced by the courts. It is void ''[[ab initio]]'', meaning &quot;from the beginning.&quot;

*'''Mutual Right to Remedy''': Both parties must have an equal right to remedy upon breach of the terms by the other party

*'''Mutual Obligation to Perform''': Both parties must have some obligation to fulfill to the other. This can be distinct from '''consideration''', which may be an initial inducement into the contract.

==Written contracts==
Contrary to common wisdom, an informal exchange of promises can still be binding and legally as valid as a written contract. A spoken contract is often called an &quot;[[oral contract]]&quot;, not a &quot;verbal contract.&quot; Any contract that uses words, spoken or written, is a verbal contract. Thus, all oral contracts and written contracts are verbal contracts. This is in contrast to a &quot;non-verbal, non-oral contract,&quot; also known as &quot;a contract implied by the acts of the parties.&quot;  

[[Courts]] in the [[United States]] have generally ruled that if the parties have a meeting of the minds (i.e., the same intent), consideration is paid or given by the parties, and they act as though there was a formal, written and signed contract, then a contract exists. However, most jurisdictions require a signed writing for certain kinds of contracts (like real estate transactions). 

In the United States, a law setting out such requirements is typically called the [[Statute of Frauds]]; the name originates from an English statute that was for &quot;the prevention of frauds.&quot;  The point of the ''Statute of Frauds'' is to prevent false allegations of the existence of contracts that were never made, by requiring formal (i.e. written) evidence of the contract. Contracts that do not meet the requirements of Statute of Frauds legislation are unenforceable, but not void. However, a party unjustly enriched by an unenforceable contract may be subject to [[restitution]] for [[unjust enrichment]].  Statutes of Frauds are typically codified in state statutes covering specific types of contracts, such as contracts for the sale of real estate.

In [[Australia]], for contracts subject to legislation equivalent to the Statute of Frauds, there is no requirement for the entire contract to be in writing, although there must be a note or memorandum evidencing the contract, which may come into existence after the contract has been formed. The note or memorandum must be signed in some way, and a series of documents may be used in place of a single note or memorandum. It must contain all material terms of the contract, the subject matter and the parties to the contract.

In [[England and Wales]], the [[Statute of Frauds]] is still in force, but only for guarantees, which must be evidenced in writing, although the agreement may be made orally. Certain other kinds of contract (such as for the sale of land) must be in writing or they are void.

Furthermore, the existence of a written contract does not necessarily ensure its enforceability or validity. A contract can be deemed unenforceable if it requires a party to undertake an illegal act, if it was signed under [[duress]] or while intoxicated, if the disparity in knowledge between the parties is extreme and the weaker party was given onerous terms, etc.  For example, a contract to sell heroin or engage in prostitution is unenforceable on the grounds that it is against public policy.

If the terms of a contract subject to Statute of Frauds legislation are to be varied, the variations must be noted in writing as well. However, the contract may be discharged orally.

If a contract is in a written form, then generally, you are bound by its terms regardless of whether you have read it or not (''L'Estrange v. F Graucob Ltd'' [1934] 2 KB 394). However, this is tempered by the exception that if the terms of the contract are misrepresented, then the plaintiff is unable to rely on the terms of the contract; in addition, the document must be contractual in nature (''Curtis v. Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co'' [1951] 1 KB 805).

Furthermore, if a party wishes to use a document as the basis of a contract, reasonable notice of its terms must be given to the other party prior to their entry into the contract (see ''Balmain New Ferry Company Ltd v. Robertson'' (1906) 4 CLR 379). This includes such things as [[Ticket cases|tickets]] issued at parking stations.

==Void, voidable and unenforceable contracts==
In general, there are three classifications of contracts that are not binding:
* '''Void:''' If a contract is held to be void, the contract has never come into existence. For example, a contract is ''void'' if it is based on an illegal purpose or contrary to [[public policy]]; the classic example is a contract with a [[hit man]].  Such a contract will not be recognized by a court, and cannot be enforced by either party.
* '''Voidable:''' A contract is ''voidable'' if one of the parties has the option to terminate the contract. Contracts with a [[minor (law)|minor]] are examples of voidable contracts. 
* '''Unenforceable:''' If a contract is unenforceable, neither party may enforce the other's obligations. For example, in the United States, a contract is unenforceable if it violates the [[Statute of frauds]]. An  example of the above is an oral contract for the sale of a motorcycle for [[US dollar|US$]]5,000 (because in the [[USA]] any contract for the sale of goods over US$500 must be in writing to be enforceable).

===Uncertainty and incompleteness===
If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law. An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail.

However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract (see ''[[Hillas v. Arcos Ltd]]'' (1932) 147 LT 503).

Courts may also look to external standards, which are either mentioned explicitly in the contract (''Whitlock v. Brew'' (1968) 118 CLR 445) or implied by common practice in a certain field (''Three Rivers Trading Co., Ltd. v. Gwinear &amp; District Farmers, Ltd.'' (1967), 111 Sol. J. 831). In addition, the court may also imply a term; if price is excluded, the court may imply a reasonable price, with the exception of land, and second-hand goods, which are unique.

===Severence of unenforceable clauses===
If there are uncertain or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, it may be possible to sever and void just those affected clauses. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test - whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. 

===Spy contracts===
In the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a [[spy]] or [[secret agent]].  This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]).  If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence.  It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his lawsuit).

==Bilateral v. unilateral contracts==
Contracts may be bilateral or unilateral.  The more common of the two, a bilateral contract, is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a promise or promises to the other party.  For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property.  

In a unilateral contract, only one party to the contract makes a promise.  A typical example is the reward contract: A promises to pay a reward to B if B finds A's dog.  B is not obliged to find A's dog, but A is obliged to pay the reward to B if B finds the dog.  In this example, the finding of the dog is a [[condition precedent]] to A's obligation to pay.  

An offer of a unilateral contract may often be made to many people (or 'to the world') by means of an advertisement.  In that situation, acceptance will only occur on satisfaction of the condition (such as the finding of the offeror's dog).  If the condition is something that only one party can perform, both the offeror and offeree are protected &amp;mdash; the offeror is protected because he will only ever be contractually obliged to one of the many offerees; and the offeree is protected, because if she does perform the condition, the offeror will be contractually obliged to pay her.  

In unilateral contracts, the requirement that acceptance be communicated to the offeror is waived.  The offeree accepts by performing the condition, and the offeree's performance is also treated as the price, or [[consideration]], for the offeror's promise.

The most common type of unilateral contract is the insurance contract.  The insurance company promises to pay the insured a stated amount of money on the happening of an event if the insured pays premiums; note that the insured does not make any promise to pay the premiums.

Courts generally favor bilateral contracts. The general rule in the United States is: &quot;In case of doubt, an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept ''either'' by promising to perform what the offer requests ''or'' by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.&quot; ''Restatement (Second) of Contracts'' § 32 (1981) (emphasis added). Here the law attempts to provide some protection from the risk of revocation in a unilateral contract to the offeree. Note that if the offer specifically requests performance rather than a promise, a unilateral contract will exist. See [[option contract]]s for more information on protection given to the offeree in a unilateral contract.

==Express and implied contracts==
A contract can be either an express contract or an implied contract. An express contract is one in which the terms are expressed verbally, either orally or in writing. An implied contract is one in which some of the terms are not expressed in words.

===Implied in fact or implied in law===
An implied contract can either be [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] or [[implied in law contract|implied in law]]. A contract which is implied in fact is one in which the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly.  For example, by going to a doctor for a physical, a patient agrees that he will pay a fair price for the service. If he refuses to pay after being examined, he has breached a contract implied in fact.

===Quasi-contract===
A contract which is implied in law is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other.  For example, an unconscious patient treated by a doctor at the scene of an accident has not agreed (either expressly or by implication) to pay the doctor for emergency services, but the patient would be unjustly enriched by the doctor's services were the patient not required to compensate the doctor.

==Incorporation of terms==
===Course of dealing===
If two parties have regularly conducted business on certain terms, it may be reasonable to presume that in future dealings where there is no contract, the parties wish to incorporate the terms of the previous contracts. However, if a party wishes to incorporate terms by course of dealing, the original document must have been contractual in nature, and delivery receipts may not fit this description. In Australia, there is a further requirement that the document was procured after formation.

==Express and implied terms==
===Different types of statements===
Whether a statement is a term of a contract is important because only if a promise is a term of the contract can a party sue for the breach of the contract. Statements can be split into the following types:
* '''Puff (sales talk):''' If no reasonable person hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in contract is available if the statement proves to be wrong.
* '''Representation:''' A representation is a statement of fact made to induce another person to enter into a contract and which does induce them to enter into a contract, but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee its truth. If the statement proves to be incorrect, it cannot be enforced, as it is not a term of the contract, but it may prove to be a [[misrepresentation]], whereupon other remedies are available.
* '''Term:''' A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement. The test is an objective test.

Factors that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement include:
* '''Timing:''' If the contract was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the contract.
* '''Content of statement:''' It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement.
* '''Knowledge and expertise:''' In ''Oscar Chess Ltd v. Williams'' [1957] 1 WLR 370, a person selling a car to a second-hand car dealer stated that it was a 1948 Morris, when in fact it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement.

===Terms implied in fact===
The Privy Council proposed a five stage test in ''BP Refinery Western Port v. Shire of Hastings'':
# '''Reasonableness and equitableness:''' The implied term must be reasonable and equitable.
# '''Business efficacy:''' The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the contract to operate better, that does not fit this criterion.
# '''Obviousness:''' The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in ''Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v. State Rail Authority of New South Wales'' (1982) 149 CLR 337, a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken.
# '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required.
# '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term.

In Australia, the High Court has ruled that the test in BP Refinery applies only to [[formal contract]]s, while the test in ''Byrne and Frew v. Australian Airlines Ltd'' (1995) 185 CLR 410 shall apply to [[informal contract]]s:
* '''Necessity:''' The term must be necessary to ensure ''reasonable'' or ''effective'' operation of a contract of the nature before the court.
* '''Consistency:''' The implied term may not contradict an express term (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Clear expression:''' The term must be capable of clear expression (same as for formal contracts).
* '''Obvious:''' McHugh and Gummow JJ have stated that it must also be obvious.

===Terms implied in law===
These are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships. The other difference between this and terms implied in fact is that the test is one of necessity (''Liverpool City Council v. Irwin'' [1976] 2 WLR 562); a necessary term is one where the contract is rendered worthless or nugatory if it is without it.

===Terms implied by custom or trade===
You are generally bound by the custom of the industry that you are in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, you must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable (''Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v. Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd'' (1986) 160 CLR 226).  See also ''Frigaliment Importing Co., Ltd., v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp.'', 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by &quot;chicken&quot;) and U.C.C. § 1-205.

==Agreements to negotiate==
It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, courts nowadays (at least in Australia) will imply an obligation to negotiate in [[good faith]] provided that certain conditions are satisfied (''Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v. Sijehama Pty Ltd'' (1991) 24 NSWLR 1):
* Negotiations were well-advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and
* There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down.

The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably.

==&quot;Subject to&quot; contracts==
If a contract specifies &quot;subject to contract&quot;, it may fall into one of three categories (''Masters v. Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353):
# The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a formalised contract that will not have a different effect; or
# The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formalised contract; or
# It is merely an agreement to agree, and the deal will not be concluded until the formalised contract has been drawn up.

If a contract specifies &quot;subject to finance&quot;, it imposes obligations on the purchaser (''Meehan v. Jones'' (1982) 149 CLR 571):
* The purchaser must seek finance; and
* When offers of finance arrive, the purchaser must make a decision as to whether the offers of finance are suitable.

Once again, there is an element of good faith involved.

This may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.
Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract.
With conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met.
Failure of a condition does not void the contract, it is just regarded as voidable.

==Statutory law applicable to contracts==
The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects.  Most countries, for example, have statutes which deal directly with [[contract of sale|sale of goods]], [[lease]] transactions and [[trade practices]].   For example, most American states have adopted Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.

There are also many acts around the world which deal with specific types of transactions and businesses.  For example, the  states of [[California]] and [[New York]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] have statutes that govern the provision of services to customers by health studios, and the UK has the Sale of Goods Act 1979 which governs the contracts between sellers and buyers.

==Remedies==
===Damages===
Typically, the remedy for [[breach of contract]] is an award of money [[damages]]. Courts usually adopt one of three ways of calculating the value of damages. 

The most common is to assess the sum which would restore the injured party to the economic position that he or she expected from performance of the promise or promises (known as an &quot;[[expectation measure]]&quot; or &quot;benefit-of-the-bargain&quot; measure of damages).  

When it is either not possible or desirable to award damages measured in that way, a court may award money damages designed to restore the injured party to the economic position that he or she had occupied at the time the contract was entered (known as the &quot;reliance measure&quot;), or designed to prevent the breaching party from being unjustly enriched (&quot;[[restitution]]&quot;). 

===Specific perfomance===
There may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid. 

The court may make an order of what is called &quot;[[specific performance]]&quot;, requiring that the contract be performed.  In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of &quot;[[specific performance]]&quot;) or issue an order, known as an &quot;injunction,&quot; that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract.    

Both an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. The one general exception to this rule is the contract of sale of real estate which, in most jurisdictions, is enforceable by specific performance as real property is considered unique. However, even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[laches]] or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.

==Procedure==
In the United States, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance, the injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit, usually in a state court, or petition a private arbitrator to decide the contract issues presented.  

Many contracts provide that all contract disputes must be arbitrated by the parties to the contract, rather than litigated in courts.  By law, some contracts, including most securities brokerage contracts, must be arbitrated; other contracts are referred by courts as a matter of local law or policy.  Arbitrated judgements are generally enforced and appealed in the same manner as ordinary court judgements; a majority of states have adopted the [[Uniform Arbitration Act]] to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgements.

In [[England and Wales]], a contract may be enforced by use of a [[claim]], or in urgent cases by applying for an [[interim injunction]] to prevent a breach.

==Theoretical considerations==
[[Contract theory]] is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with Charles Fried, maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realist]]s and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christian alternative music''' is a form of [[alternative rock]] music lyrically grounded in a [[Christianity|Christian]] worldview. The degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.

==History==
Christian alternative rock has its roots in the early [[1980s]], as the earliest efforts at [[Christian punk]] and [[new wave music]] were recorded by artists like [[Daniel Amos]], [[Andy McCarroll and Moral Support]], [[Undercover]], [[The 77s]], [[Adam Again]], [[Quickflight]], Youth Choir (later renamed [[The Choir]]), [[Lifesavers Underground]], [[The Altar Boys]], [[Steve Taylor]], [[David Edwards]], and [[Vector (band)|Vector]]. By the [[1990s]], many of these bands were being carried by independent labels, such as the growing [[Tooth &amp; Nail Records]], because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream [[Contemporary Christian Music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clive Barker''' (born [[October 5]], [[1952]], [[Liverpool]], England) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] author, director and visual artist.

Before reaching college, he went to, as he has often boasted, all the same schools as [[John Lennon]]. He studied English and Philosophy at [[Liverpool University]].

Barker is one of the leading authors of contemporary [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], starting out with pure horror writing early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1 - 6), and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]''. Later he moved towards epic modern-day fantasy  with some horror elements. Barker's distinctive style is characterized by the notion of hidden fantastical worlds existing side by side with our own (an idea he shares with contemporary [[Neil Gaiman]]), the role of sexuality in the [[supernatural]] and the construction of coherent, complex and detailed mythologies. Barker has referred to this style as &quot;dark fantasy.&quot;

When the ''Books of Blood'' were first published in the [[United States]] in cheap [[paperback]] editions, the originality, intensity and overall quality of the stories led  popular author [[Stephen King]] to say of Barker: &quot;I have seen the future of horror and its name is Clive Barker.&quot; (This is a paraphrase of a famous quote said of [[Bruce Springsteen]] at the beginning of his career.)

A critical analysis of Barker's work appears in [[S. T. Joshi]]'s ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001).

==Movies==
Barker has a keen interest in movie production, although his movies have received varying acclaim. The most successful was [[1987]]'s ''[[Hellraiser]]'', based on his novella &quot;[[The Hellbound Heart]]&quot;. His early movies, the shorts ''The Forbidden'' and ''Salome'' are experimental art movies with surrealist elements, now rereleased together, to moderate critical acclaim. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''.  He is currently working on a series of movie adaptations of his ''The Abarat Quartet'' books, under Disney's management; about the creepily-universal supernatural myths homeless children tell one another; and a film based on his [[Tortured Souls]] line of toys from [[McFarlane Toys]]. 

He recently produced &quot;Urban Myths: Bloody Mary&quot; from a script based on a newspaper report from Miami, Florida [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/issues/1997-06-05/feature.html newspaper article]. 

A short story titled ''The Forbidden'' from Barker's ''In the Flesh'' provided the basis for the film ''[[Candyman]]'' and its two sequels.

He has also produced the film ''[[Gods and Monsters]]'' which received major critical acclaim.

==Visual art==
Barker is also a prolific and talented visual artist, working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings can be seen on the covers of the collections of his plays, ''Incarnations'' (1995) and ''Forms of Heaven'' (1996), as well as on the second printing of the original UK publications of his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' series. His artwork has been exhibited at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection ''[[Clive Barker, Illustrator]]'', published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books. He also worked on the creative side of a horror [[computer game]], ''[[Clive Barker's Undying]]'', also providing the voice for the character Ambrose, a homicidal maniac who is never without his enormous axe. ''Undying'' was developed by [[DreamWorks Interactive]] and released in [[2001]] to moderate success and acclaim. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel ''The Thief Of Always'' (1992) as well as  the ''[[Abarat]]'' series.

==Comic books==
A longtime comics fan, Barker achieved his dream of publishing his own superhero books when [[Marvel Comics]] launched the [[Razorline]] imprint in [[1993]]. Based on detailed premises, titles and lead characters he created specifically for this, the four interrelated titles — set outside the Marvel universe — were ''[[Ectokid]]'' (written first by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]], then by future ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' co-creator [[Wachowski brothers|Larry Wachowski]], with art by Steve Skroce), ''[[Hokum &amp; Hex]]'' (written by [[Frank Lovece]], art by [[Anthony Williams (comics)|Anthony Williams]]), ''[[Hyperkind]]'' (written by Fred Burke, art by Paris Cullins) and ''[[Saint Sinner]]'' (written by [[Elaine Lee]], art by Max Douglas). A 2002 Barker telefilm titled ''Saint Sinner'' bore no relation to the comic.

Barker horror adaptations and spin-offs in comics include the Marvel/Epic series ''[[Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Nightbreed]]'', ''[[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]]'', ''The Harrowers'',  ''Book of the Damned'' and ''Jihad''; [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse Books]]' series and [[graphic novels]] ''Tapping The Vein'', ''Dread'', ''Son of Celluloid'', ''Revelations'' ''The Life of Death'', ''Rawhead Rex'' and ''The Yattering and Jack''; and [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Primal'', among others.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker's children's fantasy novel ''[[The Thief of Always]]'', written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is also going to be publishing 12 issue adaptations of Barker's novel ''[[The Great and Secret Show]]''

==Relationships==
Barker has been openly [[gay]] since the early 1990s, first mentioning his dating life to US audiences in the pages of ''[[The Advocate]]'' magazine. He currently lives in [[Los Angeles]], CA, with his partner, photographer [[David Armstrong (photographer)|David Armstrong]], and Armstrong's daughter from a previous relationship, Nicole. The household also includes a great many pets (dogs, fish, even a bird named Malingo).

Barker's play ''[[Frankenstein in Love]]'' will receive a rare staging in London at the end of September; see the Barons Court or www.ellupofilms.com for details.

'''Comic fantasy''' is a subgenre of [[fantasy]] that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy.  It is sometimes known as '''low Fantasy''' in contrast to [[high fantasy]], which is primarily serious in intent and tone.

==Examples==
The subgenre rose in the latter half of the [[20th century|twentieth century]], with [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and Fletcher Pratt's [[Harold Shea (fictional series)|Complete Enchanter]] stories being early exemplars. In more modern times, [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Xanth]]'' books, [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[MythAdventures]]'' of Skeeve and Aahz books, and [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' provide good examples. A rare example on radio is the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Hordes of the Things]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[pl:CLU]]
'''CLU''' is a [[programming language]] created at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] by [[Barbara Liskov]] and her students between [[1974]] and [[1975]]. It was notable for its use of constructors for abstract data types that included the code that operated on them, a key step in the direction of [[object oriented programming]] (OOP). However many of the other features of OOP are missing or incomplete, notably inheritance, and the language is also hindered by a sometimes frustrating syntax. CLU and [[Alphard programming language|Alphard]] both seem to get as close as possible to being a full OO language without actually being one. 

==Clusters==
The [[syntax]] of CLU was based on [[ALGOL programming language|ALGOL]], then the starting point for most new language design. The key addition was the concept of a ''cluster'', CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster). Clusters correspond generally to the concept of an &quot;object&quot; in an OO language, and have roughly the same syntax. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements [[complex number]]s:

&lt;code&gt;
     complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ....
          rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]
          add = proc ... end add;
          subtract = proc ... end subtract;
          multiply = proc ... end multiply;
          ...
     end complex_number;
&lt;/code&gt;

While clusters offered a then-advanced system for structuring programs, CLU did not offer any sort of structure for the clusters themselves. Cluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created &quot;locally&quot; inside other clusters. This problem is not unique to CLU, but it is surprising that so many languages have lacked this feature — given the centralness in ALGOL of giving scope to variables, it seems that giving scope to cluster/object names would be an obvious extension.

CLU does not perform implicit type conversions. In a cluster, the explicit type conversions 'up' and 'down' change between the abstract type and the representation. There is a universal type 'any', and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being &quot;base types&quot; such as integers.

==Other features==
Another key feature of the CLU type system are ''iterators'', which return objects from a collection one after the other. Iterators were &quot;black boxes&quot; that offered an identical [[application programming interface|API]] no matter what data they were being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of &lt;code&gt;complex_number&lt;/code&gt;s would be identical to that for an array of &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;s. Iterators are now a common feature of most modern languages. ''(See [[Generator (computer science)|Generator]])''

CLU also includes [[exception handling]], based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using &lt;code&gt;signal&lt;/code&gt; and handled with &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt;. Oddly, given the focus on type design, CLU does not offer [[enumeration|enumerated types]], nor any obvious way to create them.

A final distinctive feature in CLU is multiple assignment, where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment operator]]. For instance, writing &lt;code&gt;x,y=y,x&lt;/code&gt; would exchange values of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. In the same way, functions could return several values, like &lt;code&gt;x,y,z=f(t)&lt;/code&gt;. 

All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic.

==Influence on other programming languages==
&lt;!-- this should probably be incorporated into the main article instead of having bullet points  --&gt;
* [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]] borrowed several concepts from CLU (for example, the ''yield'' statement)
* CLU, along with [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] were major inspirations for C++ templates; 
* CLU's exception handling mechanisms also influenced newer languages like Java and C++.
* All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic. Directly influenced Java.
* [[Python]] and [[C Sharp|C#]] include [[generator (computer science)|generator]]s, which first appeared in CLU as ''iterators''

== The rise of Gorbachev==

Although reform in the [[Soviet Union]] stalled between [[1969]]&amp;ndash;[[1982]], a generational shift gave new momentum for reform. Changing relations with the [[United States]] might also have been an impetus for reform. While it was [[Jimmy Carter]] who had officially ended the policy of [[Détente]] following [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]], East-West tensions during the first term of U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] ([[1981]]&amp;ndash;[[1985]]) increased to levels not seen since the [[1962]] [[Cuban missile crisis]].  

After years of stagnation, the &quot;new thinking&quot; of younger Communist apparatchiks began to emerge. Following the death of the elderly [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to the position of [[General Secretary]] of the Soviet Union in [[March]] [[1985]], marking the rise of a new generation of leadership. Under Gorbachev, relatively young, reform-oriented technocrats, who had begun their careers in the heyday of &quot;de-Stalinization&quot; under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1953-1964), rapidly consolidated power within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]], providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization, and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the West.
[[Image:Perestroika.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Perestroika'' poster featuring Gorbachev]]
By the time Gorbachev ushered in the process that would lead to the dismantling of the Soviet administrative command economy through his programs of ''[[glasnost]]'' (political openness), ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring), and ''[[uskoreniye]]'' (speed-up of economic development), the Soviet economy suffered from both hidden [[inflation]] and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open [[black market]] that undermined the official economy. Additionally, the costs of superpower status&amp;ndash;the military, [[KGB]], subsidies to client states&amp;ndash;were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backwardness.

=== Reforms ===

The first reform under Gorbachev was the 1985 alcohol reform, which was designed to fight wide-spread [[alcoholism]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Prices on [[vodka]], [[wine]] and [[beer]] were lifted, and their sales were restricted. People who were caught drunk at work or in public were prosecuted. Drinking on long-distance trains and in public places was banned. Economically it was a serious blow to the state budget (a loss of approximately 100 billion rubles according to [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]]) after alcohol production migrated to [[black market]] economy.

The [[Wikisource:Law on Cooperatives|Law on Cooperatives]] enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors.Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.

''Glasnost'' gave a greater freedom of speech. The press became far less controlled, and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released. While Gorbachev's primary goal in undertaking ''glasnost'' was to pressure conservatives who opposed his policies of economic restructuring, he also hoped that the Soviet people would support his reform initiatives.

In January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi-candidate elections into the Soviet political process. In June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference, Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. In December 1988, the Supreme Soviet approved the establishment of a [[Congress of People's Deputies]], which constitutional amendments had established as the Soviet Union's new legislative body. Elections to the congress were held throughout the USSR in March and April 1989. On [[March 15]], [[1990]], Gorbachev was elected as the first executive [[President of the Soviet Union]].

=== Unintended consequences ===

Gorbachev's efforts to streamline the Communist system offered promise, but were ultimately doomed to failure. By the late 1980s, it was evident that Gorbachev's policies of openness and democratization were going far beyond what had been originally intended. ''Perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' began exposing how a once revolutionary Communist Party had become moribund at the very centre of the system. 

Relaxation of [[censorship]] under ''glasnost'' resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the [[media]]. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied existed and actively concealed. Problems such as poor housing, [[alcoholism]], [[drug abuse]], [[pollution]], outdated [[Stalinist]]-era factories, and petty to large-scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored, received increased attention. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by [[Stalin]] and the Soviet regime, such as [[Gulag]]s and the [[Great Purges]] ignored by the official media.  Moreover, the ongoing [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]], and the mishandling of the [[1986]] [[Chernobyl accident]] further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.

In all, the very positive view of Soviet life which had long been presented to the public by the official media was being rapidly dismantled, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight. This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party's social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.

Fraying amongst the members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations and instability of its western allies, first indicated by [[Lech Wałęsa]]'s [[1980]] rise to leadership of the [[trade union]] [[Solidarity]], accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its satellite states for protection of its borders, as buffer states. By 1989, Moscow had repudiated the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its Eastern European allies, fatally depriving Eastern Europe’s regimes of the assurance of Soviet assistance and intervention in the event of popular uprising. Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact nations saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of [[Romania]], a violent uprising.  By 1991, [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and Romania's communist governments imposed after [[World War II]] were brought down as revolution swept [[Eastern Europe]].

The Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequenses of ''glasnost'' reverberated throughout the country.  Despite efforts at containment, the instability in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In [[election]]s to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, [[nationalism|nationalists]] as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR's central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR's constituent republics had been largely undermined.

The rise of nationalism under ''glasnost'' soon reawakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people.  One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the Azerbaijan SSR, passed a resolution calling for unification with the [[Armenian SSR]]. Violence against local Azerbajanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumgait]].

Emboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of ''glasnost'', public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although ''perestroika'' was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country's chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the [[Stalinist]] system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.

By 1990 the Soviet government had virtually lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as revenues from the sales of vodka plummeted during the anti-alcohol campaign and because republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier-producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.

==Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR==
[[Image:Gorbachev and Yeltsin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gorbachev accused [[Boris Yeltsin]], his old rival and [[Russia]]'s first post-Soviet president, of tearing the country apart out of a desire to advance his own personal interests.]]
On [[February 7]], [[1990]] the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union agreed to give up its monopoly of [[power (sociology)|power]]. The USSR's constituent republics began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow, and started a &quot;war of laws&quot; with the central Moscow government, in which the governments of the constituent republics repudiated all-union legislation where it conflicted with local laws, asserting control over their local economies and refusing to pay tax revenue to the central Moscow government. This strife caused economic dislocation, as supply lines in the economy were broken, and caused the Soviet economy to decline further.

In January 1990, a visit by Gorbachev to the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], provoked a pro-independence rally of around 250,000 people. On [[March 11]] [[1990]], Lithuania, led by Chairman of the Supreme Council [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], declared independence. However, the [[Red Army]] had a strong presence in Lithuania. The Soviet Union initiated an economic blockade of Lithuania and kept troops there &quot;to secure the rights of ethnic Russians.&quot;

On [[March 30]], [[1990]] the Estonian Supreme Council declared Soviet power in [[Estonia]] since [[1940]] to have been illegal, and started a process to reestablish Estonia as an independent state.

On [[January 13]], [[1991]] clashes between Soviet troops and unarmed Lithuanian civilians occurred. This further weakened the Soviet Union's legitimacy, internationally and domestically.

On [[March 17]], [[1991]], in a Union-wide [[referendum]] 78&amp;nbsp;% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form. The Baltics, Armenia, Georgia and [[Moldavian SSR|Moldova]] boycotted the referendum. In each of the other nine republics, a majority of the voters supported the retention of the Soviet Union.

In June 1991, direct elections were held for the post of president of the [[Russian SFSR]]. [[Boris Yeltsin]] got 57&amp;nbsp;% of the vote, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]] got 16&amp;nbsp;%.

===The August Coup===
''For the main article see [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]].''

Gorbachev attempted to restructure the Soviet Union into a less centralized state. On [[August 20]], [[1991]], the republics were to sign a new union [[treaty]], making them independent republics. The new treaty was supported by the [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] republics, who needed the Soviet Union to prosper. Disintegration of the USSR also accorded the desire of local authorities, such as Yeltsin's presidency, to establish full power over their territories. The conservatives and remaining patriots of the USSR, still strong within the CPSU and military establishment, were completely opposed to anything which might contribute to the weakening of the Soviet state.

On [[August 19]], [[1991]], to prevent the signing of the union treaty by forming the &quot;State Committee on the State Emergency.&quot; The &quot;Committee&quot; put Gorbachev (vacationing in the [[Crimea]]) under house arrest and attempted to restore the union state. The coup leaders quickly issued an emergency decree suspending political activity and banning most newspapers.

Thousands of people came out to defend the &quot;White House&quot; (Yeltsin's office), then the symbolic seat of Russian sovereignty. The organizers tried but ultimately failed to arrest Boris Yeltsin, who rallied mass opposition to the coup.

On [[August 21]], the coup collapsed, and Gorbachev returned as president of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's powers were fatally compromised as neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands. Through the fall of 1991, the Russian government took over the union government, ministry by ministry. In [[November]] 1991, Yeltsin issued a decree banning the CPSU throughout the Russian republic. 

On [[September 6]], [[1991]], the Soviet government recognized the independence of the three Baltic states. Then on [[December 1]], [[1991]], Ukraine declared its independence from the USSR after a popular referendum wherein 90&amp;nbsp;% of voters opted for independence.

===Formation of the CIS and official end of the USSR===

On [[December 8]], [[1991]], the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian, and [[Belarusian SSR|Belarusian]] republics met in [[Belavezhskaya Pushcha]] to issue a declaration that the Soviet Union was dissolved and replaced by the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). 

Twelve of the fifteen republics signed the [[European Energy Charter]] in the Hague on [[December 17]], [[1991]] as if they were sovereign states, along with 28 other European countries, the European Community, and four non-European countries.  

On [[December 25]], [[1991]], Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR. By [[December 31]], [[1991]] all official Soviet institutions had ceased operations as individual republics assumed the central government's role. The Soviet flag was lowered for the last time over the Kremlin.

===Summary===
The four principal elements of the old Soviet system were the hierarchy of soviets, ethnic [[federation|federalism]], state [[socialism]], and Communist Party dominance. Gorbachev's programs of ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' produced radical unanticipated effects that brought that system down. As a means of reviving the Soviet state, Gorbachev repeatedly attempted to build a coalition of political leaders supportive of reform and created new arenas and bases of power. He implemented these measures because of economic problems and political inertia that clearly threatened to put the Soviet Union into a state of long-term stagnation. 

But by using structural reforms to widen opportunities for leaders and popular movements in the union republics to gain influence, Gorbachev also made it possible for nationalist, orthodox communist, and populist forces to oppose his attempts to liberalize and revitalize Soviet communism. Although some of the new movements aspired to replace the Soviet system altogether with a liberal democratic one, others demanded independence for the national republics. Still others insisted on the restoration of the old Soviet ways. Ultimately, Gorbachev could not forge a compromise among these forces and the consequence was the collapse of the Soviet Union.

==Post-Soviet restructuring==
:''For main article see [[History of post-Soviet Russia]].''

[[Image:143669 beggar300.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Begging in the streets of post-Soviet Russia became increasingly common in the 1990s.]]
In order to restructure the Soviet administrative command system and effect a transition to [[capitalism]], Yeltsin's [[Shock_therapy_(economics)|shock program]], employed days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, cut subsidies to money-losing farms and industries, decontrolled prices, moved toward convertibility of the [[ruble]], created opportunities for his circle and other enterpreneurs to seize the former people's property and moved toward restructuring the largely state-owned economy. After obtaining power, the vast majority of idealistic reformers gained huge possessions using their key positions in government structures. Preexisting institutions had been abandoned before the legal structures of a market economy that governed private property, oversaw the financial market, and enforced taxation had been made functional.

Market economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise [[GDP]] and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create a movement outward towards production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.

Russia currently faces many problems that the planners in 1992 did not expect, including the 25% of the population that now lives below the poverty line, a drop in life expectancy, low birthrates, and the drop in GDP, which plunged by half after the USSR's collapse. In the eyes of many of the older generation in Russia, life under the old Soviet system was much better and more secure than it is today. These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly lead to election of Yeltsin's Communist opponent in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]].

'''Corsican''' (''Corsu'' or ''Lingua Corsa'') is a [[Romance language]] spoken on the island of [[Corsica]] ([[France]]), alongside [[French language|French]], which is the official language. A similar dialect to Corsican is also spoken to some extent in the [[Gallura]] area of [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). It has strong similarities to [[Italian language|Italian]] and in particular the [[Tuscany]] dialects of Italian. Most linguists consider it as a Tuscany dialect, the closest to modern Italian. 

According to its [[Unesco]] classification, the Corsican language is currently in danger of becoming extinct. In recent years, greater protection for the language has been discussed as part of proposals for increased autonomy of the region of Corsica from France. 

The language has several dialects including Northern Corsican, spoken in the [[Bastia]] and [[Corte]] area, and Southern Corsican, spoken around [[Sartene]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]]. The dialect of [[Ajaccio]] has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at [[Calvi]] and [[Bonifacio]] are closer to [[Genoa]] dialect, also known as Ligurian.

In the Sardinian region of Gallura, including the town of [[Tempio Pausania]], and on the island of [[La Maddalena]] &quot;[[Gallurese]]&quot; is spoken. This is a transitional dialect with many similarities with Southern Corsican.

The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in [[proverb]]s. Corsica also has a tradition of [[polyphony|polyphonic]] singing that dates back to the 16th century and is thought to have evolved from similar traditions on the Italian mainland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Commodore''' is the commonly used name for '''Commodore International''', a [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]] based electronics company who was a vital player in the [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]] field in the [[1980s]]. The company is also known under the name of its [[R&amp;D]] operation, '''Commodore Business Machines''' ('''CBM'''). Commodore developed and marketed the world's best-selling desktop computer, the [[Commodore 64]] (1982). The company declared [[bankruptcy]] in [[1994]], but since then, there have been several attempts to revive its [[Amiga]] systems.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===

[[Image:Commodore Logo(197x).png|right|thumb|220px|Original Commodore logo: all-lowercase company name (1962&amp;ndash;1984).]]
The company that would become Commodore International was started in Toronto by [[Jack Tramiel]] in [[1954]]. He had already run a small business fixing [[typewriter]]s for a few years while living in New York and driving a cab, but managed to sign a deal with a Czechoslovakian company to manufacture their designs in Canada and moved to Toronto to start production. By the late 1950s a wave of Japanese machines forced most North American typewriter companies out of business, but Tramiel instead turned to [[adding machine]]s.

In [[1962]] the company was formally incorporated as '''Commodore Business Machines''' ('''CBM'''). In the late [[1960s]] history repeated itself again when Japanese firms started producing adding machines. The company's main investor and chairman, [[Irving Gould]], suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to understand how they could compete. Instead he returned with a new idea, to produce electronic [[calculator]]s, which were just coming on the market.

Commodore soon had a profitable calculator line and was one of the more common brands in the early [[1970s]], producing both ordinary as well as scientific/programmable calculators. However in [[1975]] [[Texas Instruments]], the main supplier of calculator parts, decided to enter the market directly and put out a line of machines priced at less than what it charged Commodore for the parts. Commodore had to be rescued once again by an infusion of cash from Gould, which Tramiel used beginning in [[1976]] to purchase several second-source chip suppliers, including [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology, Inc.]], in order to guarantee supply. He agreed to buy MOS, who were having troubles of its own, only on the condition that its chip designer [[Chuck Peddle]] join Commodore directly as head of engineering.

=== &quot;Computers for the masses, not the classes&quot; ===

Once Chuck Peddle had taken over engineering at Commodore, he convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were already a dead end and that they should turn their attention to [[home computer]]s. Peddle packaged his existing [[KIM-1]] [[single-board computer]] design in a metal case, along with a full-travel [[QWERTY]] keyboard, [[monochrome]] [[computer monitor|monitor]], and [[Datassette|tape recorder]] for program and data storage, to produce the [[Commodore PET]].  From its [[1977]] debut, Commodore would be a computer company.

Commodore had been reorganized the year before into '''Commodore International, Ltd.''', moving its financial headquarters to the [[Bahamas]] and its operational headquarters to [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], close to the MOS Technology site. The operational headquarters, where research and development of new products were taking place, retained the name Commodore Business Machines, Inc.

The PET computer line was used primarily in [[Primary education|school]]s, due to its tough all-metal construction (some models were labeled &quot;Teacher's PET&quot;), but did not compete well in the home setting where graphics and sound were important. This was addressed with the introduction of the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] in [[1981]], which was introduced at a cost of $299 and sold in retail stores. Commodore took out aggressive ads featuring [[William Shatner]] asking consumers &quot;Why buy just a video game?&quot;  The strategy worked and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units. A total of 2.5 million units were sold over the machine's lifetime.

CBM introduced the [[Commodore 64]] in [[1982]] as the successor to the VIC-20. Thanks to a well-integrated series of [[integrated circuit|chips]] designed by MOS, the C64 possessed remarkably-capable sound and graphics for its time and is often credited with starting the computer [[demo scene]]. Its $595 price was high compared to the VIC-20, but it was still much less expensive than any other 64K computer on the market. Early C64 ads boasted &quot;You can't buy a better computer at twice the price.&quot;

In [[1983]] Tramiel decided to focus on market share and cut the price of the VIC-20 and C64 dramatically.  TI responded by cutting prices on its [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]], which had been introduced in 1981. Soon there was an all-out price war involving Commodore, TI, [[Atari]] and practically every vendor other than [[Apple Computer]].  This price war contributed to the [[Video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]].  By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped somewhere around 22 million C64s&amp;mdash;making the C64 the best selling computer of all time&amp;mdash;and in the process drove TI out of the home-computer market, almost destroyed Atari, bankrupted most smaller companies, and wiped out its own savings.  Tramiel's motto, &quot;Business is war,&quot; took its toll.

===Tramiel quits; The Amiga vs ST battle ===

[[Image:Commodore Logo(1985).png|right|thumb|220px|Second Commodore logo, with mixed-case company name (1985&amp;ndash;1994).]]
Commodore's board of directors was as trapped as anyone else by the price spiral and decided it wanted out. A power struggle started inside the company, and in January [[1984]], Tramiel quit. He founded a new company, Tramiel Technologies, and hired away a number of Commodore engineers to begin work on a next-generation computer design. Then, in July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], providing him with a manufacturing base and sales network to help him strike back at his rivals at Commodore.

Now it was up to the remaining Commodore management to salvage the company and plan for the future. It did so by buying a small company called [[Amiga Corporation]]. The company was better known for its forays into the video game market, designing controllers for game consoles as well as making games for the Atari 2600. But as it turned out, its video game business was more of a smoke screen to fund the company's true purpose, designing a groundbreaking new computer. Commodore brought this new [[16-bit]] computer design (known initially as the Lorraine, later dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]) to market in the fall of [[1985]] for US $1295.

But Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. He had already released the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800. However, this was not the design Atari had intended to launch at the time. Prior to Tramiel's purchase of the company, Atari had signed a licensing deal with Amiga that granted them use of the Lorraine's custom chips, the very chips that made Amiga's computer so powerful. Tramiel wanted to use these chips in his forthcoming ST computer, but true to form he wanted those chips at a bargain-basement price. Knowing Amiga was strapped for cash as a result of the crash of the video game market, he held back a scheduled payment Atari was due to pay Amiga in an effort to force it to renegotiate the contract with terms more favorable to Atari. This strategy backfired when Commodore bought Amiga and canceled the contract, citing Atari's late payment as the reason. In the end, Atari was forced to use off-the-shelf components to complete the ST's design. (A lawsuit over the Amiga license dragged on for years, only to be abruptly settled. Terms were not disclosed, but many speculate the settlement involved Atari obtaining Amiga development systems for use with the [[Atari Lynx|Lynx]] handheld game system.)

Throughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame_war#Holy_wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior. This was reflected in roughly-similar sales numbers for the two platforms until the release of the [[Amiga 500]] in [[1987]], which took over the market from the ST. Ultimately, the Amiga outsold the ST about 1.5 to 1 in spite of being later to market. Neither platform, however, captured a significant share of the world computer market.

=== The beginning of the end ===

In the 1970s and early 80s, the computer press had often come to Commodore--one of the industry's leading players--and its colorful management for information. The VIC-20 and C64, although aggressively marketed, arguably were successful more because of their price than because of their marketing. After Tramiel's departure, Commodore executives shied away from mass advertising and other marketing ploys, fearful of repeating past mistakes.  Commodore also retreated from its earlier strategy of selling its computers at discount houses and toy stores, and now favored authorized dealers.

However, by the late 1980s, the personal computer market had become dominated by the [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms. By comparison, Commodore's marketing efforts for the Amiga proved ineffective and even seemed half-hearted (one common joke was &quot;If CBM got the contract to advertise [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], they'd call it 'Warm Dead Bird'&quot;).  The company also concentrated on consumer products that would not see demand for another couple of years &amp;ndash; including a [[digital television|digital TV]] system called [[CDTV]], and later a 32-bit [[CD-ROM]]-based [[game console]]: the [[Amiga CD32|CD32]].

Once the clear technology leader, the Amiga rapidly lost ground as the personal computer market became increasingly dominated by the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]]. When introduced in 1985, the Amiga was competing favorably against [[Intel 80286|286]]-based systems with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics and rudimentary sound capabilities that frequently cost 2&amp;ndash;3 times as much. But well into the early 1990s, CBM continued selling mostly Amigas with 7&amp;ndash;14 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[Motorola 68000|68000]]-family CPUs (even though [[Amiga 3000]] with 25Mhz [[68030]] was in the market by that time), when PCs with 33 MHz [[Intel 80486|486]]'s, high-color [[graphics card]]s and [[SoundBlaster]] (or compatible) [[sound card]]s offered comparable, and eventually higher, performance at very competitive prices. Software developers by and large became focused primarily, if not exclusively, on the PC market.

The Amiga hardware did not begin to reach feature parity with PCs until the release of the [[A4000]] and [[A1200]] computers in late [[1992]], which featured an improved graphics chipset, the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]].  By this point, both the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh had several times the market share of the Amiga platform.  As software developers shifted to these platforms, the Amiga lost value for mainstream consumers.  The custom-designed and custom-built AGA chipset also cost Commodore considerably more than the commodity chips used in IBM PCs, reducing Commodore's profit margins.  Although welcomed by Amiga enthusiasts, the machines did little to improve Commodore's fortunes.

=== The sun sets on Commodore ===

With market share eroding, Commodore embarked on a series of decisions that were heavily questioned by shareholders and the press, who sometimes accused management of only being interested in removing as much value from the company as possible before it finally disappeared. By [[1994]], only its operations in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] were still profitable.

Commodore declared bankruptcy on [[April 29]] [[1994]], and its assets were liquidated. The former site of Commodore's operational headquarters in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], now houses the headquarters and broadcast studios of leading cable retailer [[QVC]], Inc. (On [[November 26]], [[2004]], QVC became the first retailer to sell the [[C64 Direct-to-TV|DTV]], a &quot;C64 in a joystick&quot; designed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]].)

The company's computer systems, especially the C64 and Amiga series, retained a cult following among their users for years after its demise.

===Post-Commodore International, Ltd.===

Following its liquidation, Commodore's former assets went their separate ways, with none of Commodore's successors repeating Commodore's early success.

Commodore UK was the only subsidiary to survive the bankruptcy and even placed a bid to buy out the rest of the operation, or at least the former parent company. For a time it was considered the front runner in the bid, and numerous reports, all false, surfaced during the [[1994]]-[[1995]] time frame that Commodore UK had made the purchase. Commodore UK stayed in business by selling old inventory and making computer speakers and some other types of computer peripherals. However, Commodore UK lost its financial backing after several larger companies, including [[Gateway Computers]] and [[Dell Inc.]], became interested, primarily for Commodore's 47 patents relating to the Amiga. Ultimately, the successful bidder was [[Germany|German]] PC conglomerate [[Escom]], and Commodore UK was absorbed into Escom in mid-[[1995]].

Escom paid US$14 million for Commodore International, primarily for the Commodore brand name. It separated the Commodore and Amiga operations into separate divisions and quickly started using the brand name on a line of PCs sold in [[Europe]]. However, it quickly started losing money, went bankrupt on [[July 15]], [[1996]], and was liquidated.

In September [[1997]], the Commodore brand name was acquired by Dutch computer maker [[Tulip Computers NV]]. Tulip's ownership was little more than the answer to a trivia question until [[July 11]], [[2003]], when Tulip announced it would re-launch the Commodore name, including new Commodore 64-related products, and threatened legal action against commercial Web sites that used the computer's name without a license. On [[18 June]] [[2004]], Tulip introduced the website CommodoreWorld.com (see external links, below), run by its new daughter company '''Commodore International BV'''.

The Commodore brand name resurfaced in late [[2003]] on an inexpensive portable [[MP3]] player made in [[China]] by [[Tai Guen Enterprise]], sold mostly in [[Europe]]. However, the device's connection to Tulip, the legal owners of the name, is unclear.

In July of [[2004]], Tulip announced a new series of products using the Commodore name: fPET, a flash memory-based USB Key drive; mPET, a flash-based MP3 Player and digital recorder; eVIC, a 20 GB music player; and the C64 DTV.

In late [[2004]] Tulip sold the Commodore name to [http://www.commodoreworld.com/corporate/ Yeahronimo Media Ventures] for &amp;#8364;22 million [http://www.theregister.com/2004/12/29/tulip_sells_commodore/]. The sale was completed in March [[2005]] after months of negotiations.

The Commodore Semiconductor Group (formerly MOS Technology, Inc.) was bought by its former management and in [[1995]], resumed operations under the name '''GMT Microelectronics''', utilizing a troubled facility in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]] that Commodore had closed in [[1992]]. By [[1999]] it had $21 million in revenues and 183 employees. However, in [[2001]] the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] shut the plant down. GMT ceased operations and was liquidated.

Ownership of the Amiga line passed through several owners, from Escom of Germany in [[1995]], and then to U.S. PC clone maker [[Gateway Computers|Gateway]] in [[1997]], before being licensed to '''Amiga, Inc.''', a company founded by former Gateway employees Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss in [[2000]].

'''Commodore''' is a [[military rank]] used in some [[navy|navies]] for officers whose position exceeds that of a Captain, but is less than that of a [[flag officer]].  

==History==

The rank of Commodore derives from the [[French language|French]] ''commandeur'', which was one of the highest ranks in orders of [[knight]]hood, and in military orders the title of the knight in charge of a ''commenda'' (a local part of the order's territorial possessions).  

The [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] also used the rank of ''[[commandeur]]'' from the end of the [[16th century]] for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in [[1955]]. 
The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] has adopted the English spelling of ''commodore'' for an equivalent rank.

The rank of Commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon Captains who commanded [[squadron]]s of more than one vessel.  In many navies, the rank of Commodore was merely viewed as a [[Senior Captain]] position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of Commodore the prestige of [[flag officer]] status.

==Naval rank==

The following articles deal with the rank of Commodore (or its equivalent) as it is employed in various countries.

* [[Commodore (RN)|Commodore]] ([[United Kingdom]] / [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]])
* [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] ([[United States]])
* [[Kommodore]] ([[Germany]])

==Merchant and boating rank==

Commodore is also a title held by the senior captain within a shipping company. It is also a title held by the senior officer of many yacht clubs and boating associations.

==Other uses==

In the [[Church of Scientology]], &quot;The Commodore&quot; was one of the many titles (and some critics would say, the least grandiose among them) held by the church's founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]].  As the head of [[Sea Org]], a pseudo naval branch of Scientology, Hubbard awarded himself this title.   In fact, Hubbard never earned an actual rank higher than [[Lieutenant]] in his [[U.S. Navy]] service during [[World War II]].

In the [[United States Coast Guard Auxiliary]], the senior elected officer of the organization is the National Commodore, while there are Commodores elected for the Atlantic and Pacific regions.

[[Vanderbilt University]]'s intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, a reference to [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]'s self-appointed title (he was the master of a large shipping fleet).

==The rank of commodore in fiction==

*In the [[video game]] [[StarCraft]], a [[Terran]] battlecruiser (presumably its commander) holds the rank of commodore.

      <comment>/* Formulation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy-Riemann differential equations''' in [[complex analysis]], named after [[Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]], are two [[partial differential equation]]s which provide a necessary ''but not necessarily sufficient'' condition for a function to be [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (it is a sufficient condition if, for example, the functions ''u'' and ''v'' have continuous partial derivatives). This system of equations was first published in [[1814]] by Cauchy, in his paper ''Sur les intégrales définies''.

==Formulation==

Let ''f''(''x'' + ''iy'') = ''u'' + ''iv'' be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[open subset]] of the [[complex number]]s '''C''' to '''C''', where ''x'', ''y'', ''u'', and ''v'' are [[real number|real]], and regard ''u'' and ''v'' as [[real number|real]]-valued functions defined on an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''f'' is holomorphic if and only if ''u'' and ''v'' are continuously differentiable and their partial derivatives satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are:

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial x } = { \partial v \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial y } = -{ \partial v \over \partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The equations correspond structurally to the condition that the [[Jacobian]] matrix is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp;   -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a  
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Complex_number#Matrix_representation_of_complex_numbers|matrix representation of a complex number]]. Geometrically, this expresses the [[conformal]] nature by a combination of [[rotation]] and [[enlargement]], for any analytic function at a point where its derivative isn't zero. It does so by a first-order picture (small discs are rotated and enlarged to other small approximate discs).

It follows from the equations, if they can be differentiated twice, that ''u'' and ''v'' must be [[harmonic function]]s since they satisfy [[Laplace's equation]]. The equations can therefore be seen as the conditions on a given pair of harmonic functions to come as real and imaginary parts of a complex-analytic function. For a given harmonic function ''u'' a corresponding harmonic function ''v'' is called a [[harmonic conjugate]]. If it exists it is unique up to a constant term.

== Example ==

The equations give a direct insight into [[antiholomorphic function]]s.

Suppose a complex function ''f'' analytic on an open set ''D''. Then ''f'' satisfies Cauchy-Riemann equations; that is, if &lt;math&gt;f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} = {\partial v \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\partial v \over \partial x} = - {\partial u \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now suppose &lt;math&gt;\bar f&lt;/math&gt; is also analytic on ''D''. Then since &lt;math&gt;f(x + iy) = u(x, y) - iv(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} = -{\partial v \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\partial v \over \partial x} = {\partial u \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining this with the early equations, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} = {\partial u \over \partial y} = {\partial v \over \partial x} ={\partial v \over \partial y} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows that ''f'' is [[locally constant]] on ''D'', and constant if ''D'' is connected.

==Derivation==

Consider a function ''f''(''z'') = ''u''(''x'', ''y'') + i ''v''(''x'', ''y'') over '''C''', and we wish to calculate its derivative at some point, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. We can essentially approach ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; along the real axis towards 0, or down the imaginary axis towards 0.

If we take the first path:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f'(z)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} {f(z+h)-f(z) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{u(x+h,y)+iv(x+h,y)-[u(x,y)+iv(x,y)]\over h}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{[u(x+h,y)-u(x,y)]+i[v(x+h,y)-v(x,y)]\over h}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\left[\frac{u(x+h,y)-u(x,y)}{h}+i\frac{v(x+h,y)-v(x,y)}{h}\right]}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}
This is now in the form of two [[difference quotient]]s, so now

:&lt;math&gt;f'(z)={\partial u \over \partial x} + i {\partial v \over \partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the second path:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f'(z)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} {f(z+ih)-f(z) \over ih}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{u(x,y+h)+iv(x,y+h)-[u(x,y)+iv(x,y)]\over ih}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\left[\frac{u(x,y+h)-u(x,y)}{ih} +i\frac{v(x,y+h)-v(x,y)}{ih}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\left[-i\frac{u(x,y+h)-u(x,y)}{h}+\frac{v(x,y+h)-v(x,y)}{h}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\left[\frac{v(x,y+h)-v(x,y)}{h}-i\frac{u(x,y+h)-u(x,y)}{h}\right]}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Again, this is now in the form of two [[difference quotient]]s, so

:&lt;math&gt;f'(z)={\partial v \over \partial y} - i {\partial u \over \partial y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equating these two we get

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} + i {\partial v \over \partial x} = {\partial v \over \partial y} - i {\partial u \over \partial y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equating real and imaginary parts, then

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} = {\partial v \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial y} = - {\partial v \over \partial x}. \quad\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Alternative formulation ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy&lt;/math&gt; for real variables ''x'' and ''y''. Then we can write &lt;math&gt;x = (z + \bar z)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = (z - \bar z)/(2i)&lt;/math&gt;. Now &lt;math&gt;\mathit{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as ''real'' functions of ''complex'' independent variables &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar z&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating &lt;math&gt;\mathit{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial x \over \partial z} = {1 \over 2}\ \mathrm{and}\  {\partial y \over \partial z} = {1 \over 2i}&lt;/math&gt;

as well as

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial x \over \partial \bar z} = {1 \over 2}\ \mathrm{and}\ {\partial y \over \partial \bar z} = -{1 \over 2i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiate a function &lt;math&gt;f (x, y) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial z} = {\partial f \over \partial x}{\partial x \over \partial z} + {\partial f \over \partial y}{\partial y \over \partial z}\ \mathrm{and}\ {\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = {\partial f \over \partial x}{\partial x \over \partial \bar z} + {\partial f \over \partial y}{\partial y \over \partial \bar z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, substitution yields:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial z} = {1 \over 2}\left({\partial f \over \partial x} + {1 \over i}{\partial f \over \partial y}\right)\ \mathrm{and}\ {\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = {1 \over 2}\left({\partial f \over \partial x} - {1 \over i}{\partial f \over \partial y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If we let &lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then, since &lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial x} = {\partial u \over \partial x} + i{\partial v \over \partial x}\ \mathrm{and}\ {\partial f \over \partial y} = {\partial u \over \partial y} + i{\partial v \over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over \partial x} + i{\partial v \over \partial x} = {1 \over i}\left({\partial u \over \partial y} + i{\partial v \over \partial y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This represents Cauchy-Riemann equations.

The relation has this interpretation:  &lt;math&gt;\mathit{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt; must be constant with respect to &lt;math&gt;\bar z&lt;/math&gt;. This expresses the concept that an analytic function is &quot;truly&quot; a function of a single complex variable, rather than of a real vector.

==Polar representation==

Considering the polar representation &lt;math&gt;z=re^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, the equations take the form

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial r } = {1 \over r}{ \partial v \over \partial \theta},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial v \over \partial r } = -{1 \over r}{ \partial u \over \partial \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Several variables==

There are Cauchy-Riemann equations, appropriately generalized, in the theory of [[several complex variables]]. They form a significant system of overdetermined PDEs. As often formulated, the ''[[d-bar operator]]'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;

annihilates holomorphic functions. This generalizes most directly the formulation

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, 

where

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = {1 \over 2}\left({\partial f \over \partial x} - {1 \over i}{\partial f \over \partial y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Chaim Topol''' (born [[September 9]], [[1935]]), often billed simply as '''Topol''', is one of the most famous [[Israel]]i [[theater|theatrical]] and [[film]] performers.  

== Biography ==
Topol was born in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].  He first practised acting in amateur theatrical plays that were conducted within the [[Israeli Army]]. Later on he managed to establish his own theatre troupe in [[Tel Aviv]] and in [[1961]] he significantly contributed to the foundation of the Municipal Theatre of [[Haifa]]. 

Despite some criticism that he has received over the years for supposedly using &quot;cute&quot; acting tricks, Topol has managed to retain his stardom and his personal cult following for over three decades.

== Acting career ==

Topol appeared in his first film in [[1964]], and in [[1966]] he made his first English-language screen appearance as [[Abou Ibn Kaqden]] in the big-budget [[Mickey Marcus]] biopic ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]''. 

He came to greatest prominence in the role of [[Tevye]] the milkman in the long-running musical show ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. After scoring an enormous success on the [[London]] stage, he later appeared in the [[1971]] film version of the play.  In [[1972]] Topol was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] and for his perfomance in the film.  He was on active service with the [[Israeli army]] at the time, but was granted permission to attend the awards ceremonies.

Some of his other notable appearances were in ''[[Galileo (movie)|Galileo]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]), ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), and the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[For Your Eyes Only]]'' ([[1981 in film|1981]]). One of Chaim Topol's best known roles in an Israeli production was in the controversial ''[[Sallah Shabbati]]'' by [[Ephraim Kishon]] &amp;mdash; a play, later adapted for film, depicting the hardships of a new [[Sephardi]] Jewish family in Israel of the early [[1950s]]. He has recently starred in ''[[Left Luggage (film|Left Luggage]]'' (1998) playing the role of Mr. Apfelschnitt, and ''[[Time Elevator]]'' (1998) as Shalem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Christadelphians''' (''Brothers and Sisters in Christ'') are a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denomination]], which developed in [[United Kingdom]] and [[North America]] in the [[19th century]]. There are approximately 50 000 Christadelphians in 130 countries.

==Beliefs==

Christadelphians base their beliefs wholly on the [[Bible]], and accept no other texts as inspired by [[God]]. They believe that [[God]] is the creator of all things and the father of true believers. He is a separate being from his son, [[Jesus]] Christ. The [[Holy Spirit]] is not a person, but the power of God used in creation and for [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|salvation]], and at certain times in history has been given to believers.

Jesus is the promised [[Messiah]], in whom the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament (particularly those to [[Abraham]] and [[David]]) find their fulfilment. Jesus is the [[Son of Man]], in that he inherited [[Sin#Christian views of sin|sin]]-prone human nature from his mother, and [[Son of God]] by virtue of his miraculous conception by the power of God. Although [[Temptation#Christian views of temptation|tempted]], he committed no sin, and was therefore a perfect representative sacrifice to bring salvation to sinful humankind. God raised him to [[immortality]], and he ascended to [[Heaven]], God's dwelling place. Jesus will return in person to establish the kingdom of God on earth, centered in Jerusalem.

People become disciples of Christ only by belief in his teachings, by [[repentance]], and through [[baptism]] by total immersion in water. Although saved by faith in God's grace, real faith will manifest in works, and so believers are expected to live a life consistent with Bible teaching. After death, believers are in a state of non-existence, knowing nothing until the [[Resurrection]] at the return of Christ. Following the judgment at that time, the accepted are given the gift of [[immortality]], and live with Christ on a restored Earth, helping him to establish the Kingdom of God, and to rule over the mortal population for a thousand years (the [[Millennium]]). Christadelphians view the future Kingdom of God as the focal point of the Gospel taught by Jesus and the apostles. They point to fulfilled Bible prophecy, particularly as regards the nations, as clear evidence that the Scriptures can be trusted.

Christadelphians reject a number of doctrines traditionally held by the orthodox Christian denominations, notably the immortality of the [[soul]], the [[Trinity]], and the pre-existence of Christ. They believe that where the words ''[[devil]]'' or ''[[Satan]]'' occur in the Bible, they should be understood as the inherent evil within man (i.e. sin) and his inclination to disobey his Creator. These terms may also be used in reference to specific political systems or individuals in opposition or conflict. [[Hell]], is understood to simply refer to the grave to which all men go, rather than being a place of eternal torment.

Christadelphians believe the doctrines they reject were introduced into Christendom after the 1st century, and cannot be demonstrated from the Bible.

Christadelphians are [[conscientious objectors]] (but not [[pacifists]]), and refrain from involvement with politics, joining the armed forces, the police force, or other organised bodies such as trade unions. There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading, bible study, prayer, and morality. Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of a Jesus Christ in bread and wine.

==History==
There have been small groups of believers down the centuries, and particularly since the Reformation, who held unorthodox views. Groups such as the [[Anabaptist|Anabaptists]], [[Waldensians|Waldenses]], [[Socinianism|Socinians]], Racovians and the [[Polish brethren|Polish Brethren]] shared some or even many beliefs  held by Christadelphians. 
[[Isaac Newton]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[John Locke]], [[William Tyndale]] all appear to have held beliefs close to those of Christadelphians on the unity of God, the mortality of man and the role of the Jews in God's purpose.

From the mid-19th century, there were groups in many parts of the United Kingdom and North America which held to the beliefs outlined above, and who were loosely associated with one another. Of particular significance was the publication in 1849 of [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] work, ''Elpis Israel'' in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible. Groups associated with him met under various names, including ''Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'', until the  time of the [[American Civil War]]. At that time, church affiliation was required to register for conscientious objector status and in 1865 Thomas chose for registration purposes the word ''Christadelphian'', which was already in use by some members of congregations holding these beliefs. It is derived from the Greek for &quot;Brothers and sisters in Christ&quot;. 

In the nineteenth century Christadelphian meetings sprang up rapidly in the United Kingdom, America and throughout the English-speaking world. From the early days of Christadelphians, many have simply read the Bible for themselves, and discovered its truth independently. They have then come into contact with Christadelphians, and joined them.

Christadelphians suffered three divisions early on in their history when three groups separated from the main body. A number left in 1873 and eventually became known as the ''[[Nazarene fellowship]]'', a separate religious denomination still in existence. In 1884-5 a dispute arose concerning the inspiration of the Bible. Robert Ashcroft, a leading member, wrote an article which challenged commonly held views about inspiration. In the controversy which followed, the Birmingham ecclesia withdrew fellowship from Ashcroft. Some members, while not agreeing with Ashcroft's views on inspiration, did not approve of Birmingham's handling of the matter. This group eventually left the Birmingham ecclesia and formed a new ecclesia which became known as the Suffolk Street ecclesia. The ecclesias throughout the world which supported them became known as the ''Suffolk Street fellowship''.

The third division occurred in 1898 centered on whether the Judgement at the return of Christ would be limited to baptised believers, or would apply to all who had heard the Gospel message. The majority, who held the latter view, amended their Statement of Faith to clarify this. Those not accepting the amendment became the ''Unamended fellowship''. 

The group from which the Unamended and Suffolk Street fellowships had seceded became generally known as the ''Temperance Hall fellowship''. It underwent a further schism in 1923 over military service and other issues. This resulted in the formation of the ''Berean fellowship''. The Bereans subsequently divided over divorce and remarriage, with the majority becoming known as the ''Dawn fellowship''.

In the early 1950s members of the Berean fellowship re-joined the Temperance Hall fellowship, though not all Bereans agreed with this move.  In 1957-8, there was further reunion with the Suffolk Street fellowship, which had already incorporated many of the Unamended fellowship outside North America. This re-united group, which now included the large majority of Christadelphians, became known as the ''Central fellowship''. 

Some Christadelphians did not accept this reunion since they held that the reasons for separation remained. They formed the ''Old Paths Fellowship''.

Despite periodic efforts at union the Central and Unamended fellowships in North America remain divided. The Berean, Dawn and Old Paths fellowships also continue to the present day.

Christadelphians from different fellowships do communicate with one another over various issues, use some of each others' publications and there are usually continuing attempts to resolve areas of disagreement.

The name Christadelphians is a generic title describing a group of people who share similar origins, but as history shows have quite a diverse history. For more information about individual fellowships readers are recommended to read the relevant Wikipedia entry.

==Organisation==

Christadelphians usually call their congregations ''ecclesias''. There is no central Christadelphian organization or hierarchy.  Ecclesias are autonomous to a degree and co-operation between most of them is based on a common acceptance of the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith [http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm]. The Unamended fellowship use the Unamended Statement of Faith [http://www.texas-christadelphians.org/00_tuc.asp?nav=nav_main&amp;page=doct_stmt_faith]. Anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in this statement and is in good standing in their &quot;home ecclesia&quot; is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia. 

Christadelphians do not have paid [[minister of religion|ministers]]. Most male members are eligible to teach and perform other duties, and these are usually assigned on a rotation, rather than having a designated preacher. Governance follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, typically with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.

Christadelphians, based on their understanding of the Bible, make a distinction between the roles of male and female members. Women are not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, and do not sit on ecclesial arranging committees. They do, however, participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees (for example, for youth work, evangelism, welfare). Women also participate in discussions, teach children, perform music, discuss and vote on business matters, preach, teach unbelievers, and engage in most other activities.

Christadelphian ecclesias actively preach to their neighbours and co-operate at a regional, national, and international level in proselytizing. There are also ecclesially-accountable committees for youth and Sunday School work, military service issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.

[[Image:RG-59.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coaxial cable]] is often used to transmit '''cable television''' into the house]]

'''Cable television''' or '''Community Antenna Television''' ('''CATV''') (often shortened to '''cable''') is a system of providing [[television]], [[FM radio]] programming and other services to consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted directly to people’s televisions through fixed [[optical fiber]]s or [[coaxial cable]]s as opposed to the over-the-air method used in traditional television broadcasting (via radio waves) in which a television antenna is required. 

It is most commonplace in [[Canada]], the [[United States]],  [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[East Asia]], though it is present in many other countries, mainly in [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. In [[Africa]], cable TV has had little success, as it is not cost-effective to lay cables in sparsely populated areas, and although so-called &quot;wireless cable&quot; or [[MMDS|microwave]]-based systems are used, &quot;direct-to-home&quot; satellite television is far more popular, especially in [[South Africa]].   

Technically, both cable TV and CATV involve distributing a number of [[television]] [[Television network|channels]] collected at a central location (called a [[Cable television headend|headend]]) to [[subscriber]]s within a community by means of a network of [[optical fiber]]s and/or [[coaxial cable]]s and [[broadband]] [[amplifier]]s.

As in the case of radio broadcasting, the use of different frequencies allows many channels to be distributed through the same cable, without separate wires for each. The [[tuner]] of the TV, [[VCR]] or radio selects one channel from this mixed signal.

The same program is often simultaneously broadcast by radio and distributed by cable, usually at different frequencies. Other programs may be distributed by cable only; rules restricting content (e.g. regarding [[nudity]] and [[pornography]]) are often more relaxed for cable than for over-the-air TV.

Traditional cable TV systems worked strictly by way of [[analog signal|analog]] signals (i.e. using standard radio waves) but many modern cable TV systems also employ the use of [[digital cable]] technology, which uses compressed digital signals, allowing them to provide many more channels than they could with analog alone.

Many cable television systems were formerly known as CATV (Community Antenna Television) systems as they were originally composed simply of a shared antenna located in a high location to which multiple households could have their TVs connected via coaxial cable. This was designed to provide access to television signals in areas where reception was traditionally poor. As cable-only networks began to appear on CATV systems, picked up via satellite rather than by antenna, the use of the term CATV has largely faded and the term cable television has taken its place.

== History  of U.S. cable television and its regulation ==
During the television licensing freeze of the late [[1940s]], the demand for television increased. Since new television licenses were not being issued, the only way the demand was met was by Community Antenna Television. The first commercial CATV System was developed in [[1948]] by [[John Walson]]. He had interest in an appliance store that began to carry televisions. A major problem in selling televisions in [[Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania]] was that the stations which were available were received very poorly.  Walson built an antenna on the top of a nearby mountain and strung a wire from it to his shop. A neighbor asked for the wire to be connected to his house and Walson connected it to his own house. He said he would extend the wire to anyone who would buy one of his television receivers, and in [[1949]] he started charging for the service. visit; http://www.cablecenter.org/education/library/oralHistoryDetails.cfm?id=270

Another system in Mahanoy City was founded by [[Jerrold Electronics]] Corp. which served the other side of town. Both were originally three-channel systems and were upgraded to five. Other systems were built: some conceived the idea independently, others didn't, and others laid claim to the title of first.

On [[August 1]], [[1949]] [[T.J. Slowie]], a secretary of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], sent a letter to a CATV pioneer in [[Astoria, Oregon]], [[L.E. Parsons]], requesting he &quot;furnish the Commission full information with respect to the nature of the system you may have developed and may be operating.&quot; He did. This is the first known involvement of the FCC in CATV. An FCC lawyer, [[E. Stratford Smith]], determined the Commission could exercise [[common carrier]] jurisdiction over CATV. The FCC didn't act on this opinion and Smith later changed his mind after working in the cable industry for some time and testifying in [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee hearings. Senator and future Federal Communications Commissioner [[Kenneth A. Cox]] attended and participated in these hearings. He prepared a report entitled the [[Cox Report]] for the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. This report was against CATV and supported the FCC policy of a television station in every community.

In [[1959]] and [[1961]] bills were introduced in [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that would have determined the role of the FCC in CATV policy. The 1959 bill, which actually made it to the floor of the Senate, would have limited FCC jurisdiction to CATV systems within the contours, i.e. the broadcast range, of a single station. It was defeated. The 1961 bill proposed by the FCC would have given the Commission authority over CATV as CATV, and not as a common carrier or broadcaster. The Commission could then adopt rules and regulations &quot;in the public interest&quot; to govern CATV in any area covered both by CATV and broadcast television. No action was ever taken on this bill.

More important than Congressional action in determining Federal Communications Commission CATV policy were court cases and FCC hearings. ''[[Frontier Broadcasting Co. v. Collier]]'' was a hearing in which broadcasters tried to get the FCC to exercise common carrier authority over 288 CATV systems in 36 states. The broadcasters maintained that CATV went against the FCC's Sixth Report and Order, which advocated at least one television station in every community. In [[1958]], the FCC decided that CATV was not really a common carrier since the subscriber did not determine the programming. [[Carter Mountain Transmission]] Corp., a common carrier that already transmitted television signals by microwave to CATV systems in several Wyoming towns, wanted to add a second signal to two of the towns and add two signals to a previously unserved town. A television station in one town opposed this and protested to the FCC on the grounds of economic damage. A hearing examiner supported Carter Mountain but the Commission supported the television station. The case was taken to appeal, as most are, and the Federal Communications Commission won. &quot;The fact that no broadcaster has actually gone off the air due to CATV competition at the time the government moved to expand its authority (nor have any since) did not stay the momentum for the expansion of regulatory authority. That some economic impact was merely plausible sufficed as the basis for government concern and government action.&quot; The FCC overruled a hearing examiner in favor of broadcasters again in the &quot;San Diego Case&quot;. The CATV systems in [[San Diego, California]] wanted to import stations from Los Angeles, some of which could be seen in San Diego; the television stations in San Diego didn't want the signals imported. The television stations won, not allowing the signals on future cable lines in San Diego and its environs. The FCC's reasoning was to protect the present and future [[ultra high frequency]] stations in San Diego. 

In the First Report and Order by the Federal Communications Commission on CATV the FCC gave itself the power to regulate CATV. This Report and Order was designed to protect small town television stations. It did this by imposing two rules, which in slightly altered form still stand: one requires that a CATV system carry all local stations in which the CATV system is in the &quot;A&quot; (best reception) contour of the station. The second prohibits the importation of programs from a non-local station that duplicates programming on a local station if the duplication is shown either 15 days before or 15 days after its local airing. This [[1965]] report reasoning is as follows: 1) CATV should carry local stations because CATV supplements, not replaces, local stations and the non-carriage of local stations gives distant stations an advantage since people will not change from the cable to the antenna to see a local station; 2) non-carriage is &quot;inherently contrary to the public interest&quot;; 3) CATV duplication of local programming via distant signals is unfair since broadcasters and CATV do not compete for programs on an equal footing; the FCC recommends &quot;a reasonable measure of exclusivity&quot;. 

The [[1966]] Second Report and Order made some minor changes in the First Report and Order and added a major regulation. This was designed to protect UHF stations in large cities. The new rule disallowed the importation of distant signals into the top 100 markets, thus making CATV profitable only in cities with poor reception. In 1968 the Supreme Court upheld the FCC's right to make rules and regulations concerning CATV. In its decision on United States v. Southwestern Cable, the &quot;San Diego Case&quot;, it said &quot;the Commissions authority over 'all interstate ... communications by wire or radio' permits the regulation of CATV systems.&quot;

=== The birth of public access television ===
{{main|Public-access television}}
In [[1969]] the FCC issued rules requiring all CATV systems with over 3500 subscribers to have facilities for local origination of programming by [[April 1]], [[1971]]. The date was later suspended. In [[1972]], Dean Burch steered the FCC into a new area of regulation. It lifted its restrictions on CATV in large cities, but now put the burden of more local programming on CATV operators. In [[1976]], the FCC used its rule making power to require that new systems now had to have 20 channels, and that cable providers with systems of 3500 subscribers or more had to provide PEG ([[public-access television|public]], education, and government access) channel capacity, and facilities and equipment necessary to use this capacity.

==Programming==
===United States===
In the [[United States]], cable television programming is often divided between basic and premium programming. Basic cable TV networks are generally transmitted without any [[Television encryption|scrambling]] or other special methods and thus anyone connected to the cable TV system can receive them.  Basic cable networks receive at least some funding through fees paid by the cable TV systems for the right to include the network in its channel lineup.  Most basic cable TV networks also include advertising to supplement the fees, due to their programming cost being greater than the fees paid by cable TV systems. Premium cable refers to networks, such as [[HBO]] and [[Showtime]], that scramble or encrypt their signals so that only those paying additional monthly fees to their cable TV system can legally view them (via the use of cable box).  Because these networks command much higher fees from cable TV systems, their programming is generally commercial free. 

There are several features of cable programming that distinguish it from broadcast television.  Because cable television carries more bandwidth than broadcast TV (10 to 20 times as many channels), there is room for more specialized channels catering to particular demographics or interests.  Also, because cable TV networks rely much less, or in some cases not at all, on revenue from commercials, they can feature programming (such as speciality sports or programming in foreign languages) that draws much smaller viewer numbers than what broadcast networks would find acceptable.  And finally, since cable TV channels cannot be viewed by those (e.g., children) without the proper equipment, the FCC’s rules regarding acceptable content do not apply to cable TV networks, allowing greater freedom in the use of language, nudity, and violence. 

The lack of restrictions on content has led to cable TV programs with more adult-oriented content such as [[nudity]] and strong language, including some premium cable networks broadcasting [[soft-core porn]] programs.  Premium cable networks have traditionally been the loosest with regard to content, since they require a cable box to view, making it easier to restrict children’s access to them.  Thus, one can find nudity, foul language, and even soft-core pornography on these networks, though, so far, not [[hard-core pornography]], possibly due in part to such factors as the risk of cable TV systems dropping them or legal risk.  Basic cable, on the other hand, has not traditionally been as loose with regard to content.  While there are no FCC rules that apply to content on basic cable networks, because most such networks rely at least partly on advertising revenue, they have buckled to pressure from advertisers to keep their content more in line with that of broadcast TV.  Thus, many basic cable networks voluntarily censor their programs, particularly with regard to language and nudity.  In recent years though, some basic cable networks have begun to relax their self-imposed restrictions, particularly late at night.  Thus, programs like [[Comedy Central]]’s [[South Park]] often contain content deemed unsuitable for U.S. broadcast TV.  Some basic cable networks have also recently aired R-rated movies, uncut, late at night.

There has been a recent push to create laws that force cable providers to allow consumers to purchase individual cable TV channels &quot;a la carte,&quot; i.e. to allow them to pick and choose which channels they would like to have available in their homes.  This is not likely to occur until digital cable television becomes popular, although technically, analog cable television would be sufficient if all channels were scrambled, as it is very difficult to notch out individual channels from a cable TV line without scrambling.  For example, many cable providers have a &quot;basic plan&quot; consisting of local channels and a few national cable networks; and an &quot;economy basic&quot; plan consisting of local channels only.  Both plans are supplied on the same cable, but the cable company can filter out the expanded channels to the &quot;economy basic&quot; subscribers using a low-pass filter which filters out higher channels.  Notch filters are available which can filter out a &quot;notch&quot; of channels (for example, channels 45-50 can be &quot;notched&quot; out yet the subscriber can receive channels below 45 and higher than 50).  However, to do this individually for a single subscriber who wants many &quot;notches,&quot; would be very difficult unless a scrambling system is used requiring a set-top box.  These problems are alleviated with the use of digital cable, which requires a set-top converter box.  This converter can be programmed remotely to allow or disallow access to channels on an individual basis. The use of [[IPTV]] (i.e., delivery of television over an internet or IP-based network) makes it even easier, since the provisioning of channels can be fully automated.

==Cable television fees and programming lineups==
Cable TV systems impose a monthly fee depending on the number and perceived quality of the channels offered.  Cable TV subscribers are offered various packages of channels one can subscribe to. The cost of each package depends on the type of channels offered (basic vs. premium) and the quantity. These fees cover the fees paid to individual networks for the right to carry their network as well as the cost of  operating and maintaining the cable TV system so that their signals can reach subscribers homes. Additional fees and taxes are often tacked on by local, state, and federal governments.  The fee the cable TV system must pay to a cable TV network will vary depending on whether it is a basic or premium channel and the perceived popularity of that channel. Because cable TV systems are not required to carry any basic cable channels, they often try and negotiate the fee they will pay for carrying a channel. Thus more popular networks have been able to command much higher fees then less popular networks. The fees paid to basic cable networks has a benefit in that advertisement breaks on basic cable are either absent or their number and duration are far lower than on broadcast TV, where ads make up around 25% of programming in the U.S.  

Most cable systems divide their channel lineups into three or four basic channel packages. A must-carry rule requires all cable TV systems to carry local broadcast stations on their lineups. Cable TV systems are also required to offer a subscription package that provides these broadcast channels at a lower rate than the standard subscription rate. The basic programming package offered by cable TV systems is usually known as basic cable and provides access to a large number of basic cable TV networks, as well as broadcast channels, and [[local-access television]] channels. Some systems refer to this package as expanded basic, with their most minimal package being referred to as basic cable. In addition to the basic cable packages, all systems offer premium channel add-on packages offering either just one premium network (e.g. HBO) or several premium networks for one price (e.g. HBO and Showtime together). Finally, most cable systems offer pay-per-view channels where users can watch individual movies, live programs, sports, etc. for an additional fee for single viewing at a scheduled time. Some cable systems have begun to offer [[on-demand programming]], where customers can select programs from a list of offerings including recent releases of movies, concerts, sports, and reruns of TV shows and specials and start the program whenever they wish, as if they were watching a DVD or a VHS tape. Some of the offerings have a cost similar to renting a movie at a video store while others are free.   

Starting in the late [[1990s]], advances in digital signal compression (primarily Motorola's [[DigiCipher 2]] technology in [[North America]]) have given rise to wider implementation of [[digital cable]] services. Digital cable provides many more television channels over the same available bandwidth, by converting cable TV channels to a digital signal and then compressing the signal. Currently, most systems offer a hybrid analog/digital cable system. This means they offer a certain number of analog channels via basic cable service with additional channels being made available via digital cable service. Thus subscribers wishing to have access to digital cable channels must have a special cable box to receive them. Additional subscription fees are also usually required to receive these digital channels. 
Digital cable channels can offer a higher quality picture than their analog counterparts though digital compression has a tendency to soften the quality of the television picture, particularly of channels that are more heavily compressed.

Many cable systems operate as local monopolies in the United States, as cable companies typically receive exclusive rights to serve a region as a result of a franchise agreement with a local government. In some areas that is changing as competition has been allowed to enter the market, including, in some cases, city run cable systems. The rise of [[Digital Satellite System]]s, which provide the same type of programming using small satellite receivers, has also provided competition to cable TV systems.

===Mexico===
The first cable system started to operate in the early Sixties in Monterrey, as a CATV service (an antenna at the top of the Loma Larga, which could get TV signals from South Texas). Most of the other major cities didn't develop cable systems until the late Eighties, due to government censorship. By 1989 the industry had had a major impulse with the founding of Multivisión&amp;mdash;a MMDS system who started to develop its own channels in Spanish&amp;mdash;and the later development of companies such as Cablemas and [[Megacable]]. 

Over the past few years, many US networks have started to develop content for the Mexican market, such as [[CNN en Español]], [[MTV]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[Disney Channel]], and others. The country also has a DTH service called SKY (Televisa &amp; News Corp. owned). Recently DirecTV merged with Sky. The dominant company nowadays is [[Megacable]].

===United Kingdom===
In the UK Cable Television had its origins in 1938, when the first Community Antenna TV systems were setup in towns including [[Bristol]] and [[Hull]], for homes which couldn't receive transmisssions over the air; however these signals were on the [[405-line]] system. In the [[1960s]] [[Rediffusion Vision]] was setup to provide cable television in the newer 625-line and [[PAL]] formats.

In the early [[1980s]] Rediffusion Vision suplimented its service with other channels including [[The Box (TV channel)|The Music Box]], [[Screensport (TV Channel)|Screensport]], [[Sky One|Sky Channel]] and [[TEN (TV Channel)|TEN]]. The service was renamed to [[Rediffusion Cablevision]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the current generation of cable television began in the late [[1980s]] with the issue of franchises to many local operators. These small operations proved uneconomic and there has been a continuing process of consolidation and re-financing.

The two principal cable operators are now [[NTL]] and [[Telewest Broadband]], which are themselves in the process of merging.  NTL's cable service was originally known as CableTel and grew rapidly through the acquisition of, among others, ComTel (which itself had bought Telecential), Comcast, Diamond Cable and finally, in [[1999]], the residential and small business operations of [[Cable &amp; Wireless]]. Telewest also steadily acquired local operators.

Cable TV faces intense competition from [[British Sky Broadcasting|SkyDigital]]'s [[satellite television]] service, although most channels on that platform are also carried on cable (however they do lack features- for example interaction news or football that is- available  to Sky Digital viewers); very few channels are now exclusive to cable. However, paid for [[digital terrestrial television]] proved less of a competitive threat, as [[ITV Digital]] went into liquidation in [[2002]].  The re-launch of DTTV as the free [[Freeview]] service has been a success in introducing people to multichannel digital TV and seems not to have adversely affected the growth of cable and satellite subscribers.

Another potential source of competition in the future will be TV over [[broadband]]. This was initially launched, using [[ADSL]], in [[London]], where it is provided by [[HomeChoice]], and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], where it where it is provided by [[Kingston Communications]] (as of April 1st, KIT will cease).  As the speed and availability of broadband connections increase, more TV content can be delivered using protocols such as [[IPTV]].

===Republic of Ireland===
Cable television first started in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in the [[1970s]], when several comapnies (incluing state broadcaster [[RTÉ]] who began a service called RTE Relays -later Cablelink), started rebroadcasting the UK's (then) three terrestrial TV channels in some cities and larger towns. The services began offering a number of satellite channels in the [[1980s]]. The state telephone operator [[Telecom Éireann]] (now [[eircom]]) was also a stakeholder. In 1989 the company started an [[MMDS]] service called Multilink serving rural areas, as did other companies such as Irish Mulitchannel in [[Cork]], now called [[Chorus Communications|Chorus]]. Cablelink was sold to NTL in [[1999]], and renamed NTL Ireland.  On [[9 May]] [[2005]], the business was sold for [[Euro|&amp;euro;]] 325 million to MS Irish Cable Holdings BV, an affiliate of [[Morgan Stanley]].  At the time, Morgan Stanley said that it has entered into an agreement to re-sell the business to UPC Ireland BV, an indirect subsidiary of UnitedGlobalCom, now [[Liberty Global Europe]], subject to regulatory approval. 

A small number of other cable providers exist, usually serving a single town. Crossan in [[Longford]] and Casey in [[Dungarvan]] are the only two of these to have moved to a digital network, with the remaining systems often being little more than a community antenna system.

In rural areas where neither cable or MMDS are available, there have been 'deflectors', which pick up the UK terrestrial channels (either from [[Northern Ireland]] or [[Wales]]), and retransmit them on local [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] signals along with other channels. These operators faced legal action in the late [[1990s]] from MMDS operators, as they did not pay royalties to the relevant broadcasters, and were not licensed. When the deflectors were shut down, there was such an outcry in those areas that an independent candidate in [[County Donegal]], [[Tom Gildea]], was elected as a [[Teachta Dála|TD]] on a platform of supporting legalisation, which occurred in [[1999]].

===Hong Kong===
''[[i-Cable Communications Limited]] ''(branded as &quot;''CableTV''&quot;) is the holding company that runs [[Hong Kong]]'s one of four cable television service providers. It is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]]. ''Wharf Holdings Limited'' owns 67 per cent of the cable provider and the rest amongst public shareholders. Another three operators offers pay-TV via [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]], they are Now Broadband TV([[PCCW]]), HKBN Digital TV and SuperSUN(controlled by [[TVB]]).

Many in Hong Kong watch subscription TV using [[satellite television|satellite]] systems like [[STAR TV]].

===Singapore===
[[StarHub Cable Vision]] is the sole cable television operator in [[Singapore]], where private ownership of satellite dishes is banned. StarHub Cable Vision was formed as a result of a merger between [[StarHub]] and [[Singapore Cable Vision]] on [[15 May]] [[2002]]. The latter first began broadcasting as a terrestrial pay-television operator in [[1992]] as the first cable network was not completed until [[1995]]. Around 15% of households and offices in Singapore are connected to the StarHub network.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], most people do not have access to cable. Satellite is a more common way of getting subscription TV services.

[[Telstra]]'s [[Foxtel]]-carrying cable network covers parts of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].

[[Optus]]'s network covers small parts of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Brisbane]], though its restrictive subscription rules means that many people in this area are not allowed to subscribe.

A small part of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] is covered by [[Bright Telecomunications]]. Part of [[Canberra]] is covered by [[TransACT]]. Much of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] is covered by [[Austar]]. Parts of [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] are reached by [[Neighbourhood Cable]].

==Other cable-based services==
Coaxial cables are capable of bi-directional carriage of signals as well as the transmission of large amounts of data. Cable television signals use only a portion the bandwidth available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as [[broadband internet]] and [[cable telephony]].

Unlike [[North America]], many cable operators in [[Europe]] have already introduced telephone services, which operate just like existing fixed line operators. 

Broadband internet is achieved over coaxial cable by using [[cable modem]]s to convert the [[television network|network]] data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog modem to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 56k and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.

Another service being added to many cable systems is [[cable telephone]] service. This service involves installing a special telephone interface at the customer's premises that converts the analog signals from the customer's in-home wiring into a digital signal, which is then sent on the [[local loop]] (replacing the analog [[last mile]], or [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) to the company's switching center, where it is connected to the [[PSTN]]. The biggest obstacle to cable telephone service is the need for nearly 100% reliable service for emergency calls. One of the standards available for digital cable telephony, [[PacketCable]], seems to be the most promising and able to work with the [[Quality of Service]] demands of traditional analog POTS service. The biggest advantage to digital cable telephone service is similar to the advantage of digital cable TV, namely that data can be compressed, resulting in much less bandwidth used than a dedicated analog circuit-switched service. Other advantages include better voice quality and integration to a [[VoIP]] network providing cheap or unlimited nationwide and international calling. Note that in most cases, digital cable telephone service is separate from [[cable modem]] service being offered by many cable companies and does not rely on IP traffic or the Internet.

'''Cholera''' (also called '''Asiatic cholera''') is a [[water-borne disease]] caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which are typically ingested by drinking contaminated water, or by eating improperly cooked fish, especially [[shellfish]].  It was first described in a scientific manner by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] physician [[Garcia de Orta]] in the [[16th century]].

==Pathology==
===Susceptibility===
Cholera produces potentially lethal secretory diarrhea through a pathway that involves the [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]], CFTR (Gabriel 1994).  This discovery led to the hypothesis that carriers for [[cystic fibrosis]], who have lower levels of functional CFTR, are protected from the severe effects of cholera because they don't lose water as quickly as other people. This might explain the high incidence of cystic fibrosis among populations which were formerly exposed to cholera.  However, no evidence of resistance ''[[in vivo]]'' has been observed in humans, and studies in mice have produced conflicting results (Gabriel 1994, Cuthbert 1995, Hogenauer 2000).

Recent [[genetics|genetic research]] has determined that a person's susceptibility to cholera (and other diarrheas) is affected by their [[blood type]]. Those with type O blood are the most susceptible. Those with type AB are the most resistant, virtually immune. Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B.

[[Image:cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|''Vibrio cholerae'': The bacteria that causes cholera ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]&amp;nbsp;image)]]

About one million ''Vibrio cholerae'' bacteria must be ingested to cause cholera in normally healthy adults, although increased susceptibility may be observed in those with a weakened [[immune system]], individuals with decreased gastric acidity (as from the use of [[antacid]]s), or those who are [[malnutrition|malnourished]].

===Transmission===
Cholera is transmitted through ingestion of feces contaminated with the bacterium.  The contamination usually occurs when untreated sewage is released into waterways, affecting the water supply, any foods washed in the water, and shellfish living in the affected waterway &amp;#151; it is rarely spread directly from person to person.
The resulting diarrhea allows the bacterium to spread to other people under unsanitary conditions.

===Symptoms===
Symptoms include those of general GI tract upset: [[Diarrhea#Acute diarrhea|profuse diarrhea]] (eg 1L/hour), abdominal [[cramp]]ing, [[fever]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. Also those of the resulting dehydration: [[thirst]], muscle cramps, weakness, loss of tissue [[turgor]], sunken eyes and wrinkled skin, severe [[metabolic acidosis]] with [[potassium depletion]], [[anuria]], circulatory collapse and [[cyanosis]]. Death is through circulatory volume shock (massive loss of fluid and electrolytes), and can occur within hours.

The root causes of these symptoms are the [[enterotoxin]]s that ''V. cholerae'' produces.  The main enterotoxin, known as '''cholera toxin''', interacts with [[G protein]]s and [[cyclic AMP]] in the intestinal lining to open [[ion channels]].  As ions flow into the intestinal [[lumen]], water follows through osmosis.

==History==
===Origin and Spread===
Cholera was originally [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to the Indian subcontinent, with the [[Ganges River]] likely serving as a contamination reservoir. It spread by trade routes (land and sea) to [[Russia]], then to [[Western Europe]], and from Europe to [[North America]]. It is now no longer considered an issue in Europe and North America, due to [[water filtration|filtering]] and [[chlorination]] of the water supply.

* 1816-1826 - '''First pandemic''': Previously restricted, the pandemic began in [[Bengal]], then spread across [[India]] by 1820. It extended as far as [[China]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] before receding.
* 1829-1851 - '''Second pandemic''' reached Europe, [[London]] and [[Paris]] in 1832 (in London, it claimed at least 3000 victims according to a [[1832]] article; in Paris, 20 000 on a population of 650 000, and 100 000 in all of France [http://www.amicale-genealogie.org/Histoires_temps-passe/Epidemies/chol01.htm]), Russia ([[Cholera Riots]]), [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec]], [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]] and [[New York]] in the same year, and the Pacific coast of North America by 1834.
* 1849 - Second outbreak in Paris. An outbreak in North America took the life of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James K. Polk]]
* 1852-1860 - '''Third pandemic''' mainly affected Russia, with over a million deaths.
* 1863-1875 - '''Fourth pandemic''' spread mostly in Europe and [[Africa]].
* 1866 - Outbreak in North America. &lt;!-- taken from above paragraph. Not sure if this is separate from the 4th pandemic --&gt;
* 1899-1923 - '''Sixth pandemic''' had little effect in Europe because of advances in public health, but Russia was badly affected again.
* 1961-1970s - '''Seventh pandemic''' began in [[Indonesia]], called [[El Tor]] after the strain, and reached [[Bangladesh]] in 1963, India in 1964, and the USSR in 1966. From [[North Africa]] it spread into Italy by 1973. In the late 1970s there were small outbreaks in Japan and in the South Pacific.
* January 1991 to September 1994 - Outbreak in [[South America]], apparently initiated by discharged ballast water. Beginning in [[Peru]] there were 1.04 million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was a non-O1, [[nonagglutinable vibrio]] (NAG) named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in [[Tamilnadu]], India and for a while displaced El Tor in southern Asia before decreasing in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain and occurs in a new serogroup. There is evidence as to the emergence of wide-spectrum resistance to drugs such as [[trimethoprim]], [[sulfamethoxazole]] and [[streptomycin]].

===Research ===
The scientists with major contributions to fighting cholera were [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], who found the link between cholera and drinking water in [[1854]], and [[Robert Koch]], who identified ''V. cholerae'' as the bacillus causing the disease.  The bacterium was originally isolated thirty years earlier by Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], but his results were not widely known around the world.

=== Other historical information ===
In the past, people travelling in ships would hang a yellow flag if one of the crews suffered from cholera. Boats with a yellow flag hung would not be allowed to disembark at any harbor. (See ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'')

==Treatment==
Treatment typically consists of aggressive [[rehydration]] and [[oral rehydration salt|replacement of electrolytes]], since the death rate is generally high due to the serious dehydration caused by the illness.

===Prevention===
Although cholera can be life-threatening, it is easily prevented. In the United States and Western Europe, because of advanced water and sanitation systems, cholera is not a major threat.  The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States was in [[1911]].  However, everyone, especially travelers, should be aware of how the disease is transmitted and what can be done to prevent it.

Simple sanitation is usually sufficient to stop an epidemic.  There are several points along the transmission path at which the spread may be halted:
* Sickbed:  Proper disposal and treatment of waste produced by cholera victims.
* Sewage:  Treatment of general sewage before it enters the waterways.
* Sources:  Warnings about cholera contamination posted around contaminated water sources.
* Sterilization: Boiling, filtering, and chlorination of water before use.

Filtration and boiling is by far the most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s, though very basic, have greatly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. 

In general, education and sanitation are the limiting factors in prevention of cholera epidemics.

[[Image:Crater Lake from rim-USGS.jpg|thumb|270px|Crater Lake|Crater Lake, Oregon]]A '''caldera''' is a [[volcano|volcanic]] feature formed by the collapse of a volcano into itself.  Calderas may be filled with water, creating crater lakes.  The word 'caldera' comes from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning &quot;cauldron&quot;.

==Caldera formation==
A caldera collapse is usually triggered by the emptying of the [[magma chamber]] beneath the volcano, often as the result of a large [[volcanic eruption|eruption]]. If enough magma is erupted, the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the ''volcanic edifice'' (the [[mountain]]) above.  Fractures will form around the edge of the chamber, usually in a roughly circular shape.  These ''ring fractures'' may in fact serve as volcanic vents. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fractures begins to collapse.  The collapse may occur as the result of a single massive eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions.  The total amount of collapse may be hundreds or thousands of meters.

===Explosive calderas===
If the magma is rich in [[silica]], the caldera is often filled in with [[ignimbrite]], [[tuff]], [[rhyolite]], and other [[igneous rock]]s.  Silica-rich magma is very [[viscous]].  As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma.  When the magma gets near the surface of the Earth, the gas expands quickly, causing [[explosion]]s and spreading [[volcanic ash]] over wide areas.  Further [[lava]] flows may be erupted, and the center of the caldera is often uplifted in the form of a ''[[resurgent dome]]'' by subsequent intrusion of magma.  A ''silicic'' or ''rhyolitic caldera'' may erupt hundreds or even thousands of [[cubic kilometer]]s of material in a single event.  Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as [[Krakatoa]] in [[1883]] or [[Mount Pinatubo]] in [[1991]], may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world.  Large calderas may have even greater effects. 

[[Image:Caldera de Taburiente.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the massive walls of the Caldera de Taburiente, La Palma: a caldera formed by erosion]]

When [[Yellowstone Caldera]] erupted 630,000 years ago it released 1000 cubic kilometers of material, covering half of [[North America]] in up to two meters of debris.  By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in [[1980]], it released 1.2 cubic kilometers of ejecta. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]]. About 75,000 years ago, this volcano released 2800 cubic kilometers of ejecta, the largest known eruption within the [[Quaternary]] Period (last 1.8 million years). In the late 1990s, [[archeologist]] Stanley Ambrose [http://www.anthro.uiuc.edu/faculty/ambrose/] proposed that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the [[human]] population to a few thousand individuals, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]] (''see'' [[Toba catastrophe theory]]). Even larger caldera-forming eruptions are known, especially [[La Garita Caldera]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], where the 5000 cubic kilometer Fish Canyon Tuff was blasted out in a truly major single eruption 27.8 million years ago.

At some points in [[geologic time]], rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters.  The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]] (erupted during the [[Tertiary Period]]) or the [[Saint Francois Mountain Range]] of [[Missouri]] (erupted during the [[Proterozoic]]).

===Non-explosive calderas===
Some volcanoes, such as [[Kilauea]] on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], form calderas in a different fashion. In the case of Kiluaea, the magma feeding the volcano is relatively silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less [[viscous]] than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano. Such calderas are also known as subsidence calderas. The magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events.  [[Kilauea]] Caldera has an inner crater known as Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u, which has often been filled by a lava lake. The largest volcano on Earth, [[Mauna Loa]] is also capped by a subsidence caldera called [[Mauna Loa|Moku&amp;lsquo;&amp;#257;weoweo Caldera]].

===Non-volcanic calderas===

It is possible, although rare, for a caldera-like formation to be created by erosion rather than volcanism.  It is believed that the [[Caldera de Taburiente]] on [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]] is an example of this.

{{otheruses}}
A '''calculator''' is a device for performing numerical [[calculation]]s.  The type is considered distinct from both a [[calculating machine]] and a [[computer]] in that the calculator is a special-purpose device that may not qualify as a [[Turing machine]].  
Although modern calculators often incorporate a general purpose computer, the device as a whole is designed for ease of use to perform specific operations, rather than for flexibility. Also, modern calculators are far more portable than other devices called computers.

==Overview==
In the near past, mechanical and clerical aids such as [[abacus|abacuses]], [[comptometer]]s, [[Napier's bones]], books of [[mathematical table]]s, [[slide rule]]s, [[adding machine]]s, were used for serious numeric work, and the word &quot;calculator&quot; denoted a person (most often male) who did such work for a living using such aids as well as pen and [[paper]]. This semi-manual process of calculation was tedious and error-prone.

Modern calculators are electrically powered and are made by numerous manufacturers, in countless shapes and sizes varying from cheap, give-away, credit-card sized models to more sturdy adding machine-like models with built-in printers.

== Electronic calculators==
In the past, some calculators were as large as today's [[computers]]. The first [[mechanical calculator]]s were mechanical desktop devices, which were soon replaced by electromechanical desktop calculators, and then by electronic devices using first [[thermionic valve]]s, then [[transistor]]s, then hard-wired [[integrated circuit]] logic. Today, most calculators are handheld microelectronic devices. 

===A basic calculator===
The complexity of calculators varies with the intended purpose. A simple modern calculator, 
suitable for everyday activities such as shopping or checking a bill, might consist of the following parts:

* A power source, such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or a [[solar panel]]
* A display, usually made from [[LED]] lights or [[LCD|liquid crystal (LCD)]], capable of showing a number of digits (typically 8 or 10)
* Electronic circuitry
* A [[keypad]] containing:
**The ten digits, 0 through 9
**The [[decimal point]]
**The [[equals sign]], to prompt for the answer
**The four arithmetic functions (namely, [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[Division (mathematics)|division]])
**A Cancel button, to clear the current calculation
**On and off buttons
**Other basic functions, such as [[square root]] and [[percentage]] (%).
* More advanced models may have a single-number [[Computer storage|memory]], which can be recalled where necessary.

Since the late-[[1980s]], it has become common to incorporate simple calculators in other small devices, such as [[mobile phone|mobile phones]], [[pager|pagers]] or [[wrist watch|wrist watches]].

===Advanced electronic calculators===
[[Image:CRAZY copy.gif|right|thumb|A screenshot of a 3D [[wire frame model|wire frame graph]] on a [[TI-89 series|TI-89]] calculator.]]
More complex ''scientific calculators'' support [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]], [[statistics|statistical]] and other [[list of functions|mathematical functions]]. The most advanced modern calculators can display graphics, and include features of [[computer algebra system]]s. They are also programmable; calculator applications include algebraic equation solvers, financial models and even games.

Only a few companies develop and make modern professional engineering and finance calculators:  The most well-known are [[Casio]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) and [[Texas Instruments|Texas Instruments]] (TI).  Such calculators are good examples of [[embedded system]]s.

== Use in education ==

In most developed countries, [[student|students]] use calculators for schoolwork.  There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic skills]] would suffer.  There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations by hand or &quot;in the head&quot;, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[estimation]] techniques and problem-solving.

There are other concerns - for example, that a pupil could use the calculator in the wrong fashion but believe the answer because that was the result given by the calculator. Teachers try to combat this by encouraging the student to make an estimate of the result manually and ensuring it roughly agrees with the calculated result. Also, it is possible for a child to type in -1 x -1 and obtain the correct answer '1' without truly realising the principle involved. In this sense, the calculator becomes a crutch rather than a learning tool, and it can slow down students in exam conditions as they check even the smallest result on a calculator.

== Other concerns on usage ==

Errors are not restricted to school pupils. Any user could carelessly rely on the calculator's output without double-checking the [[orders of magnitude|magnitude]] of the result - i.e. where the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] is positioned. This problem was all but nonexistent in the era of [[slide rule]]s and pencil-and-paper calculations, when the task of establishing the magnitudes of results had to be done by the sufficiently meticulous user.

Most everyday calculators are not completely accurate. There is a level of detail beyond which they truncate the number in memory, a symptom called [[arithmetic underflow]]. This essentially reduces the accuracy of the calculation, and this error can accumulate (for example, if the number is multiplied by itself, the error doubles). It is therefore possible for the calculator to show '''51.999999''' on the display when the accurate result is, in fact, '''52'''. Also, most everyday calculators do not follow the proper [[order of operations]] in math; therefore, if someone were to type (on an average calculator) &quot;2+4×2&quot;, they may get 12 (i.e., the answer to &quot;(2+4)×2&quot;), instead of 10, the correct answer (i.e., the answer to &quot;2+(4×2)&quot;).

Some fractions such as 2/3 are awkward to display on a calculator display as they are usually rounded to 0.66666667. Also, some fractions such as 0.14285714... can be difficult to recognise in decimal form - in fact, this number is 1/7. Some of the more advanced scientific calculators are able to work in [[vulgar fraction]]s, although the operation in practice is somewhat awkward.

== Calculators vs. computing ==

A fundamental difference between a calculator and most computers is that calculators typically operate in [[Binary-coded decimal]] rather than binary as do computers.  Also, the market for calculators is extremely price-sensitive; typically the user cares primarily about what is the least expensive model having a specific feature set, but does not care much about speed (since speed is primarily constrained by how fast the user can press the buttons).  Thus designers of calculators strive to minimize the number of logic elements on the chip, not the number of clock cycles needed to do a computation.

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement floating point math with code in ROM, and compute trigonometric functions with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require floating-point.  For similar reasons, bit-serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit-parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers: a bit-serial design minimizes the chip complexity but takes many more clock cycles.

[[Personal computer]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s can perform general calculations in a variety of ways:

*computers often have a separate calculator program, varying from one that just emulates a simple calculator, such as [[Microsoft Calculator]], to advanced [[spreadsheet]] programs such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] or [[OpenOffice.org]] Calc
*for more advanced calculations one can use a [[computer algebra]] program, such as [[Mathematica]], [[Maple computer algebra system|Maple]] or [[Matlab]].
*browsers can perform calculations using [[client-side scripting]], e.g. using [[Client-side JavaScript]] by entering &quot;javascript:alert(12*13)&quot; in the address bar (the answer 156 appears in a separate alert window) or &quot;document.write (12*13)&quot; in a [[HTML]] file, preceded with &quot;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&quot; and followed by &quot;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;.
*an interpreter or compiler for a general programming language can be used
*calculations can also be performed [[server-side]], e.g. with the [[List of Google services and tools#Calculator|calculator feature of the Google search engine]]

==History==

===Origin: The Abacus===
[[Image:Abacus 6.png|thumb|right|Chinese abacus.]]
{{main|Abacus}}
The first calculators were abacuses, and were often constructed as a wooden frame with beads sliding on wires. Abacuses were in use centuries before the adoption of the written Arabic numerals system and are still widely used by merchants and clerks in China and elsewhere.

===The 17th century===
[[Wilhelm Schickard]] built the first automatic calculator called the &quot;Calculating Clock&quot; in 1623. Some 20 years later, in 1645, French philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] invented the calculation device later known as [[Pascal's calculator]], which was used for taxes in France until 1799. The German philosopher G.W.v.[[Leibniz]] also produced a [[Calculus ratiocinator| calculating machine]].

===1930s to 1960s===
[[Image:Mechanical-Calculator.png|thumb|right|Mechanical calculator from 1914]]
From approximately the [[1930s]] through the [[1960s]], mechanical calculators were often used (see ''Mechanical Calculator'' under [[History of computing hardware]]).  These desktop devices were motor-driven and had multiple columns of keys for each digit.  [[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the [[Curta]] continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.

In [[1954]], [[IBM]] demonstrated a large all-[[transistor]] calculator and, in [[1957]], they released the first ''commercial'' all-transistor calculator (the IBM 608). In October [[1961]], the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA Mk.VII was released. This British designed-and-built machine used [[vacuum tube]]s in its circuits and cold-cathode [[nixie tube]]s for its display. It was superseded, technologically, in [[1964]] when [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the CS-10A—the world's first ''all-transistor'' ''desktop'' calculator—which weighed 25 kg (55 lb) and cost 500,000 yen (~US$2500). The first ''handheld'' electronic calculators went on sale in [[1970]] with models from Japanese manufacturers Sharp and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] weighing around 770 g (1.7 lb).

===1970s to mid-1980s===
In the early [[1970s]], the ''Monroe EPIC'' programmable calculator came on the market.  A large desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it was capable of being programmed to perform many computer-like functions.  However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction.  Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic.  During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly referred to as ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring 5.2×3.0×1.5 in (131×77×37 mm), came out in the fall of [[1971]], with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August [[1972]] the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring 5.4×2.2×0.35 in (138×56×9 mm) and weighing 2.5 oz (70g). It retailed for around $150 ([[Pound Sterling|GB£]]79). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than $10 (GB£5).

The first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions, i.e. the first slide rule-replacing model, was the [[1972]] [[HP-35]] from [[Hewlett Packard|Hewlett Packard (HP)]]; it, along with all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) (where a calculation like &quot;6 – 2&quot; is performed by pressing &quot;6&quot;, &quot;Enter↑&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;–&quot;; instead of algebraically: &quot;6&quot;, &quot;–&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;=&quot;).

In [[1973]], [[Texas Instruments|Texas Instruments (TI)]] introduced the [[SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) a hand-held ''algebraic notation'' calculator, which was later followed by the [[SR-11]] and eventually the [[TI-30]].

The first ''programmable'' hand-held calculator was the [[HP-65]], in [[1974]]; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. A year later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''continuous memory'', i.e. programs and data were retained in memory during power-off.  In [[1979]], HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41|HP-41C]].  It could be expanded with [[random access memory|RAM]] (memory) and [[read-only memory|ROM]] (software) modules, as well as peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).

===Mid-1980s to present===
[[Image:TI-84_Plus.jpg|right|thumb|A [[TI-84 Plus series|TI-84 Plus]] graphing calculator from Texas Instruments.]]
The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released steadily more feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 90s.  At the turn of the millennium, the line between a [[graphing calculator]] and a PDA/ [[handheld computer]] was not always clear (forgetting the keyboard for the sake of the argument), as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integration|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.

In March [[2002]], HP announced that the company would no longer produce calculators, which was hard to fathom for some fans of the company's products; the [[HP-48]] range in particular had an extremely loyal customer base.  Nevertheless, HP restarted their production of calculators in late 2003. The new models, however, reportedly didn't have the mechanical quality and sober design of HP's earlier calculators for which HP calculators were once famous (instead featuring the more &quot;youthful&quot; look and feel of contemporary competing designs from TI).  In the days when
a scientific calculator cost about as much as a computer does today, HP sales reps were famous
for starting demonstrations by slamming the calculator on the floor.  But today calculators
are regarded as cheap, disposable gadgets.

The [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with nearly no changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the &quot;HP 12c platinum edition&quot; which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

==Trivia==
*The word &quot;calculator&quot; is occasionally used as a pejorative term to describe an inadequately capable general-purpose [[microcomputer]]. The synonym of this meaning is &quot;[[wikt:bitty box|bitty box]]&quot;, as discussed in the [[Jargon file]].

*A curious episode of the mid 1970s involved the Melcor 635, a scientific calculator with a [[computer bug|bug]] in its [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions.  Because the [[CORDIC]] algorithms used in most calculators cannot compute the inverse trigonometric functions of [[0 (number)|zero]], these need to be [[hardcoded]] — and some engineer at Melcor got it wrong.  For any input other than exactly zero, even for instance 1.0E-99, the calculator worked correctly; the user simply had to remember not to compute the [[trigonometric function#inverse functions|arc-cosine]] of zero.  The company discovered this after making 50,000 calculators.  The upshot was an advertisement in Summer and Fall 1975 issues of such publications as ''[[Scientific American]]'' and the MIT alumni magazine headlined 'Somebody Goofed', offering these calculators, for which a typical retail price at the time would have been around 100 dollars, for $59.99.

*As many schoolchildren and students know, some words and simple phrases can be written using an ordinary [[seven-segment display]] calculator; this involves entering [[calculator spelling|certain numbers]] and then viewing the resulting words by turning the calculator display upside-down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AntiqueCashRegister7.gif|thumb|250px|right|Antique crank-operated cash register]]A '''cash register''' or '''till''' (British English) is a mechanical or electronic device for calculating and recording sales transactions, and an attached [[cash drawer]] for storing [[currency]]. 
Usually the cash register also prints a [[receipt]] for the customer.

Usually the drawer can be opened only after it is done recording a sale, except when using a special [[key (lock)|key]], which only senior personnel or the owner has. This reduces the risk of personnel [[stealing]] from the [[shop]] owner by not recording a sale and pocketing the money, in the case that the customer does not require a receipt and has to be given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than [[inventory]]). In fact, cash registers were first invented for the purpose of eliminating employee theft or [[embezzlement]].  The first registers were entirely mechanical, without receipts. The employee was required to ring up every transaction on the register, and when the total key was pushed, the drawer opened and a bell would ring, alerting the manager to a sale taking place.  Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines.

A cash register may be compulsory for [[tax]] purposes. The law sometimes also requires customers to collect the receipt and keep it at least for a short while after leaving the shop, again for checking that the shop records sales, so that it cannot [[tax evasion|evade taxes]].

Often cash registers are attached to [[weighing scale|scales]], [[barcode scanner]]s, [[checkstand|checkstands]], and [[EFTPOS]] or [[credit card]] terminals. Increasingly, dedicated cash registers are being replaced with general purpose [[computer]]s with [[Point of sale|POS]] software.

Today, these machines scan the barcode (usually [[EAN]] or [[Universal Product Code]] (UPC)) for each item, retrieve the price from a [[database]], calculate deductions for items on sale, calculate the [[tax]], calculate differential rates for preferred customers, time and date stamp the transaction, record the transaction in detail including each item purchased, record the method of payment, keep totals for each product or type of product sold as well as total sales for specified periods, and do other tasks as well.

Cash register manufacturers include [[Casio]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Wincor-Nixdorf]] and [[Uniwell]].

== Self checkout ==
{{main|Self checkout}}
Some supermarkets have introduced self-checkout machines, where the customer is trusted (to an extent) to scan the barcodes (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area (where the bag is weighed, the machine complains vocally when it thinks that something in the bag doesn't seem to weigh what the inventory database lists the weight as). There is normally a supervisor watching over several such checkouts; as such the benefit to the customer is little, the benefit to the supermarket is reduced staffing levels. Payment on these machines is accepted by card [[EFTPOS]], or cash via coinslot and bank note scanner.

==Origin==
The first cash register was invented by [[James Ritty]] in [[1879]]. He was the owner of a tavern in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and wanted to stop dishonest employees from pilfering his profits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''chronometer''' is a [[clock]] accurate enough to be used as a portable [[time standard]] on a vehicle, usually in order to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]]. In [[Switzerland]], only timepieces certified by the [[COSC]] may use the word 'Chronometer' on them.

==History==

Until the mid 1750s, [[navigation]] at [[sea]] was an unsolved problem due to the difficulty in calculating longitudinal position.  Navigators could determine their [[latitude]] by measuring the sun's angle at noon.  However to find their [[longitude]], they needed a portable time standard that would work on a ship.  Conceptually, at local high [[noon]] they could compare the chronometer's [[time]] to determine their longitude (in modern practice, a navigational almanac and trigonometric sight reduction tables permit navigators to measure the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], visible [[planet]]s or any of 57 navigational stars at any time that the horizon is visible).

The problem of creating a sea-worthy timepiece was difficult.  At the time, the best clocks were [[pendulum clock]]s, and the rolling of a ship at sea rendered the pendulum useless. [[John Harrison]], a Yorkshire carpenter, invented a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs, whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two chronometers used this system but he became rightly convinced that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. His third machine replaced one headache with a bigger one and he eventually abandoned the large machines altogether.

He finally solved the accuracy problems with his H4 chronometer, essentially a large 5 inch (12 cm) diameter pocket watch, winning a prize of £20,000 offered by the government in the early 18th century.  His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring.  This general layout remained in use until [[microchip]]s reduced the cost of a [[quartz clock]] to the point that electronic chronometers became commonplace.

Ownership of the marine chronometer's design passed to the Admiralty, who now needed manufacturers. [[Thomas Earnshaw]], [[John Arnold]] and others tackled this, moving the temperature compensation into the balance wheel itself and developing the practical and simple spring detent [[escapement]]. This combination was the defining technology of marine chronometers until the electronic era.

[[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]] was the pioneer in the industrial revolution of watch making as early as 1850 in developing the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] by Interchangeable Parts at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], which is at the base of today's worldwide manufacturing methods. The American [[Hamilton Watch Company]] harnessed [[mass production]] to produce chronometers in quantity for the [[US Navy]] during [[World War II]].

==Mechanical chronometers==

The crucial problem was to find a resonator that remained unaffected by the motions of a ship at sea.  The [[balance wheel]] solved that problem.  Balance wheels for chronometers used bi-metallic strips to move small weights toward and away from the center of the wheel, in order to adjust the period of the balance wheel for the temperature of the chronometer.  Solid balance-wheels of low-expansion steel alloys such as [[invar]] give results nearly as good, but are more susceptible to magnetism.

The other crucial problem was that the energy of most spring materials changes with temperature.  A special alloy of low-expansion nickel-steel ([[elinvar]]) was eventually developed, just to solve this problem. Additionally, balance-wheel springs had to be given a special oval shape.  The recipes for &quot;observatory quality&quot; steel balance-springs have been lost because of low production volumes.  The original manufacturers (such as Hamilton Watch) are out of business.  Some horologists claim that carbon composite springs have comparable qualities, and are nonmagnetic, as well.

The [[escapement]] drives the balance wheel, usually from a [[gear]] train.  It is the part that ticks.  Escapements have a locking state and a drive state.  In the locking state, nothing moves.  The motion of the balance wheel switches the escapement to drive, when the escapement pushes against the wheel (supplies an impulse) for a brief part of the wheel's cycle.  

The escapement is the part of a clock most prone to wear, because it moves the fastest.  The efficiency of an escapement's design, that is, how much energy is converted into resonant motion, directly affects the accuracy of a clock, and how long a clock can operate between windings.

A chronometer's escapement is usually designed to minimize the energy and time required to unlock the escapement, so that it affects the resonant frequency of the oscillator as little as possible.

Another way of making a clock more efficient is to use ruby as [[jewel bearing]]s for the axes and the parts of the escapement that make repeated contact. It could be thought that ball bearings might be used to good effect at the pivots of clocks and watches, but tests seem to show that they do not perform well under the stop-start conditions typical of mechanical timepieces. Ruby is hard-wearing, can take a high polish, and has a low co-efficient of friction with polished hard steel. Synthetic ruby can also be produced very cheaply nowadays, making it the best material for horological bearing surfaces. Lately, ceramics have been experimented with as a new material for chronometer parts subject to high wear rates.

===Complications===
In horology terms, a [[Complication (horology)|complication]] in a mechanical watch is a special feature that causes the design of the watch movement to become more complicated. Examples of complications include:
* [[Tourbillon]]
* [[Perpetual Calendar]]
* [[Minute repeater]]
* [[Equation of time]]
* [[Power reserve]]
* [[Lunar phase|Moon phases]]
* [[Double chronograph]]

==Today==

[[quartz clock|Quartz clocks]] and [[atomic clock|atomic clocks]] have made mechanical clock-chronometers obsolete for time standards used scientifically and/or industrially, although some custom watchmakers can still produce them.  The techniques used to mass-produce mechanical clock-chronometers are now lost. 

Nevertheless, in Switzerland nowadays, over 1,000,000 Officially Certified Chronometers certificates, mostly for mechanical wrist-chronometers (wrist-[[watch]]) with sprung balance oscillator, are being delivered each year, upon having been submitted to the COSC's most severe tests, each singly identified by an officially recorded individual [[serial number]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A CPU generally has these components:
# Datapaths (such as [[ALU]]s and [[pipelines]])
# Logic which controls the datapaths
# memory components such as register files, caches
# clock circuitry such as clock drivers, [[PLL]]s, clock distribution networks
# pad transceivers circuitry
# logic gate cell [[library (electronics)|library]] which is used to implement the logic

CPUs designed for high performance markets might require custom designs for
each of these items to achieve frequency, power-dissipation and chip-area goals. 

CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by:
* acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as  [[intellectual property]]
* use control logic implementation techniques ([[logic synthesis]] using CAD tools) to implement the other components - datapaths, register files, clocks

Common logic implementation techniques used in CPU design include:
* unstructured random logic 
* [[finite state machines]]
* [[microprogramming]] (common from 1965 to 1985, no longer common except for CISC CPUs) 
* [[programmable logic array]] (common in the 1980s, no longer common)

A CPU design project generally has these major tasks:
* architectural study and performance modeling 
* [[register transfer level|RTL]] (eg. logic) design and verification
* [[circuit design]] of speed critical components (caches, registers, ALUs)
* [[logic synthesis]] or logic-gate-level design
* [[static timing analysis|timing analysis]] to confirm that all logic and circuits will run at the specified operating frequency 
* physical design including [[floorplanning]], [[place and route]] of logic gates
* checking that RTL, gate-level, transistor-level and physical-level representatations are equivalent 
* checks for [[signal integrity]], [[design rule checking|chip manufacturability]] 

As with most complex electronic designs, the logic verification effort (proving that the design does
not have bugs) now dominates the project schedule of a CPU.  


Key CPU architectural innovations include [[CPU cache|cache]], [[virtual memory]], [[instruction pipelining]], [[superscalar]], [[CISC]], [[RISC]], [[virtual machine]], [[emulators]], [[microprogram]], and [[stack (computing)|stack]].

== Goals of CPU design ==

The first CPUs were designed to do mathematical calculations faster and more reliably than human &quot;computers&quot;.

Each successive generation of CPU might be designed to achieve some of these goals:
* higher performance levels of a single program or thread
* higher throughput levels of multiple programs/threads
* less power consumption for the same performance level 
* lower cost for the same performance level
* smaller die-area to allow higher levels of integration within one VLSI chip (multiple CPUs or other components)  
* greater connectivity to build larger, more parallel systems
* more specialization to aid in specific targeted markets

Because there are too many programs to test a CPU's speed on all of them, [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s were developed.
The most famous benchmarks are the SPECint and SPECfp benchmarks developed by [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]] and the [[ConsumerMark]] benchmark developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium [http://eembc.org/].

Some important measurements include:
* Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normally [[Intel]] [[IA32]] architecture) to be able run a large base of pre-existing pre-compiled software.  Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks,  most of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency.
* System designers building [[parallel computing|parallel computers]], such as [[Google_search_technology#Current_Hardware | Google]], pick CPUs based on their speed per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself. [http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM][http://news.com.com/Power+could+cost+more+than+servers,+Google+warns/2100-1010_3-5988090.html]
* Some system designers building parallel computers pick CPUs based on the speed per dollar.
* System designers building [[real-time computing]] systems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has low [[interrupt latency]] and when it has deterministic response. ([[DSP]])
* Computer programmers who program directly in assembly language want a CPU to support a full featured [[instruction set]].

&lt;!-- ... Are there other measures of &quot;goodness&quot;, &quot;figures of merit&quot;, that I'm missing here? --&gt;

Some of these measures conflict.
In particular, many design techniques that make CPU run faster make the &quot;performance per watt&quot;, &quot;performance per dollar&quot;, and &quot;deterministic response&quot; much worse, and vice versa.

== History of general purpose CPUs ==

=== 1950s: early designs ===

Each of the computer designs of the early 1950s was a unique design; there were no upward-compatible machines or computer architectures with multiple, differing implementations.  Programs written for one machine would not run on another kind, even other kinds from the same company. This was not a major drawback at the time because there was not a large body of software developed to run on computers, so starting programming from scratch was not seen as a large barrier.  

The design freedom of the time was very important, for designers were very constrained by the cost of electronics, yet just beginning to explore how a computer could best be organized.  Some of the basic features introduced during this period included [[index registers]] (on the [[Ferranti Mark I]]), a return-address saving instruction ([[UNIVAC I]]), immediate operands ([[IBM 704]]), and the detection of invalid operations ([[IBM 650]]).

By the end of the [[1950]]s commercial builders had developed factory-constructed, truck-deliverable computers. The most widely installed computer was the [[IBM 650]], which used [[drum memory]] onto which programs were loaded using either [[punched tape|paper tape]] or [[punch card]]s. Some very high-end machines also included [[core memory]] which provided higher speeds. [[Hard disk]]s were also starting to become popular.

Computers are automatic [[Abacus|abaci]].  The type of number system affects the way they work.  In the early [[1950s]] most computers were built for specific numerical processing tasks, and many machines used decimal numbers as their basic number system &amp;ndash; that is, the mathematical functions of the machines worked in base-10 instead of base-2 as is common today. These were not merely [[binary coded decimal]].  The machines actually had ten vacuum tubes per digit in each [[Processor register|register]]. Some early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] computer designers implemented systems based on ternary logic; that is, a bit could have three states: +1, 0, or -1, corresponding to positive, no, or negative voltage.

An early project for the [[U.S. Air Force]], [[BINAC]] attempted to make a lightweight, simple computer by using binary arithmetic.  It deeply impressed the industry.

As late as 1970, major computer languages were unable to standardize their numeric behavior because decimal computers had groups of users too large to alienate.

Even when designers used a binary system, they still had many odd ideas.  Some used sign-magnitude arthmetic (-1 = 10001), rather than modern [[two's complement]] arithmetic (-1 = 11111).  Most computers used six-bit character sets, because they adequately encoded [[Hollerith]] cards.  It was a major revelation to designers of this period to realize that the data word should be a multiple of the character size.  They began to design computers with 12, 24 and 36 bit data words (e.g. see the [[TX-2]]).

In this era, [[Grosch's law]] dominated computer design: Computer cost increased as the square of its speed.

=== 1960s: the computer revolution and CISC ===

One major problem with early computers was that a program for one would not work on others. Computer companies found that their customers had little reason to remain loyal to a particular brand, as the next computer they purchased would be incompatible anyway. At that point price and performance were usually the only concerns.

In 1962, IBM tried a new approach to designing computers. The plan was to make an entire family of computers that could all run the same software, but with different performances, and at different prices. As users' requirements grew they could move up to larger computers, and still keep all of their investment in programs, data and storage media.

In order to do this they designed a single ''reference computer'' called the '''[[System 360]]''' (or '''S/360'''). The System 360 was a virtual computer, a reference instruction set and capabilities that all machines in the family would support. In order to provide different classes of machines, each computer in the family would use more or less hardware emulation, and more or less [[microprogram]] emulation, to create a machine capable of running the entire System 360 [[instruction set]].

For instance a low-end machine could include a very simple processor for low cost. However this would require the use of a larger microcode emulator to provide the rest of the instruction set, which would slow it down. A high-end machine would use a much more complex processor that could directly process more of the System 360 design, thus running a much simpler and faster emulator.

IBM chose to make the reference [[instruction set]] quite complex, and very capable. This was a conscious choice. Even though the computer was complex, its &quot;[[control store]]&quot; containing the [[microprogram]] would stay relatively small, and could be made with very fast memory. Another important effect was that a single instruction could describe quite a complex sequence of operations. Thus the computers would generally have to fetch fewer instructions from the main memory, which could be made slower, smaller and less expensive for a given combination of speed and price.

As the S/360 was to be a successor to both scientific machines like the [[IBM 7090|7090]] and data processing machines like the [[IBM 1401|1401]], it needed a design that could reasonably support all forms of processing. Hence the instruction set was designed to manipulate not just simple binary numbers, but text, scientific floating-point (similar to the numbers used in a calculator), and the [[binary coded decimal]] arithmetic needed by accounting systems.

Almost all following computers included these innovations in some form.  This basic set of features is now called a &quot;[[complex instruction set computer]],&quot; or CISC (pronounced &quot;sisk&quot;), a term not invented until many years later.

In many CISCs, an instruction could access either registers or memory, usually in several different ways.
This made the CISCs easier to program, because a programmer could remember just thirty to a hundred instructions, and a set of three to ten [[addressing mode]]s rather than thousands of distinct instructions.
This was called an &quot;[[orthogonal instruction set]].&quot;
The [[PDP-11]] and [[Motorola 68000]] architecture are examples of nearly orthogonal instruction sets.

There was also the ''BUNCH'' (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, CDC, and Honeywell) that competed against IBM at this time though IBM dominated the era with [[S/360]].

The Burroughs Corporation (which later became Unisys when they merged with Sperry/Univac) offered an alternative to S/360 with their [[Burroughs B5000|B5000]] series machines. The B5000 series [[1961]] had virtual memory, a multi-programming operating system (Master Control Program or MCP), written in [[ALGOL 60]], and the industry's first recursive-descent compilers as early as 1963.

=== 1970s: large scale integration ===

In the 1960s, the [[Apollo guidance computer]] and [[Minuteman missile]] made the [[integrated circuit]] economical and practical.

Around 1971, the first calculator and clock chips began to show that very small computers might be possible.  The first [[microprocessor]] was the [[4004]], designed in 1971 for a calculator company ([[Busicom]]), and produced by [[Intel]].  The 4004 is the direct ancestor of the [[Intel 80386]], even now maintaining some code compatibility.  Just a few years later, the word size of the 4004 was doubled to form the [[8008]].

By the mid-1970s, the use of integrated circuits in computers was commonplace.  The whole decade consists of upheavals caused by the shrinking price of transistors.  

It became possible to put an entire CPU on a single printed circuit board.  The result was that minicomputers, usually with 16-bit words, and 4k to 64K of memory, came to be commonplace.

CISCs were believed to be the most powerful types of computers, because their microcode was small and could be stored in very high-speed memory. The CISC architecture also addressed the &quot;semantic gap&quot; as it was perceived at the time. This was a defined distance between the machine language, and the higher level language people used to program a machine.  It was felt that compilers could do a better job with a richer instruction set.

Custom CISCs were commonly constructed using &quot;bit slice&quot; computer logic such as the AMD 2900 chips, with custom microcode.  A bit slice component is a piece of an [[ALU]], register file or microsequencer.  Most bit-slice integrated circuits were 4-bits wide.

By the early 1970s, the [[PDP-11]] was developed, arguably the most advanced small computer of its day.  Almost immediately, wider-word CISCs were introduced, the 32-bit  [[VAX]] and 36-bit [[PDP-10]].

Also, to control a cruise missile, Intel developed a more-capable version of its 8008 microprocessor, the [[8080]].

IBM continued to make large, fast computers.  However the definition of large and fast now meant more than a megabyte of RAM, clock speeds near one megahertz [http://www.hometoys.com/mentors/caswell/sep00/trends01.htm][http://research.microsoft.com/users/GBell/Computer_Structures_Principles_and_Examples/csp0727.htm], and tens of megabytes of disk drives. 

IBM's System 370 was a version of the 360 tweaked to run virtual computing environments.  The [[VM (Operating system) |virtual computer]] was developed in order to reduce the possibility of an unrecoverable software failure.

The Burroughs B5000/B6000/B7000 series reached its largest market share.  It was a stack computer programmed in a dialect of Algol.  It used 64-bit fixed-point arithmetic, rather than floating-point.

All these different developments competed madly for marketshare.

=== Early 1980s: the lessons of RISC ===

In the early [[1980s]], researchers at [[UC Berkeley]] and [[IBM]] both discovered that most computer language compilers and interpreters used only a small subset of the instructions of a [[CISC]]. Much of the power of the CPU was simply being ignored in real-world use. They realized that by making the computer simpler and less orthogonal, they could make it faster and less expensive at the same time.

At the same time, CPUs were growing faster in relation to the memory they addressed. Designers also experimented with using large sets of internal registers. The idea was to [[cache]] intermediate results in the registers under the control of the compiler.
This also reduced the number of [[addressing mode]]s and orthogonality.

The computer designs based on this theory were called [[Reduced Instruction Set Computer]]s, or RISC.  RISCs generally had larger numbers of registers, accessed by simpler instructions, with a few instructions specifically to load and store data to memory. The result was a very simple core CPU running at very high speed, supporting the exact sorts of operations the compilers were using anyway.

A common variation on the RISC design employs the [[Harvard architecture]], as opposed to the [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] or Stored Program architecture common to most other designs.  In a Harvard Architecture machine, the program and data occupy separate memory devices and can be accessed simultaneously.  In Von Neumann machines the data and programs are mixed in a single memory device, requiring sequential accessing which produces the so-called &quot;Von Neumann bottleneck.&quot;

One downside to the RISC design has been that the programs that run on them tend to be larger. This is because [[compiler]]s have to generate longer sequences of the simpler instructions to accomplish the same results.  Since these instructions need to be loaded from memory anyway, the larger code size offsets some of the RISC design's fast memory handling.

Recently, engineers have found ways to compress the reduced instruction sets so they fit in even smaller memory systems than CISCs. Examples of such compression schemes include [[ARM architecture|the ARM]]'s &quot;Thumb&quot; instruction set. In applications that do not need to run older binary software, compressed RISCs are coming to dominate sales.

Another approach to RISCs was the [[MISC]], &quot;[[niladic]]&quot; or &quot;zero-operand&quot; instruction set. This approach realized that the majority of space in an instruction was to identify the operands of the instruction. These machines placed the operands on a push-down (last-in, first out) [[stack (computing)|stack]]. The instruction set was supplemented with a few instructions to fetch and store memory. Most used simple caching to provide extremely fast RISC machines, with very compact code. Another benefit was that the interrupt latencies were extremely small, smaller than most CISC machines (a rare trait in RISC machines). The first zero-operand computer was developed by [[Charles H. Moore]]. It placed six 5-bit instructions in a 32-bit word, and was a precursor to [[VLIW]] design (see below: 1990 to Today).

Commercial variants were mostly characterized as &quot;[[Forth]]&quot; machines, and probably failed in the market place because the power and advantages of that language were not commonly understood.  Also, the machines were developed by defense contractors at exactly the time that the cold war ended.  Loss of funding may have broken up the development teams before the companies could perform adequate commercial marketing.

RISC chips now dominate the market for 32-bit embedded systems. Smaller RISC chips are even becoming common in the cost-sensitive 8-bit embedded-system market. The main market for RISC CPUs has been systems that require low power or small size.

Even some CISC processors (based on architectures that were created before RISC became dominant) translate instructions internally into a RISC-like instruction set. These CISC chips include newer [[X86|x86]] and [[VAX]] models.

These numbers may surprise many, because the &quot;market&quot; is perceived to be desktop computers. With Intel x86 designs dominating the vast majority of all desktop sales, RISC is found in the [[Apple Computer|Apple]], [[Sun_Microsystems|Sun]] and [[SGI]] desktop computer lines. However, desktop computers are only a tiny fraction of the computers now sold. Most people own more computers in embedded systems in their car and house than on their desks.

=== Mid-1980s to today: exploiting instruction level parallelism ===

In the mid-to-late 1980s, designers began using a technique known as &quot;[[instruction pipelining]]&quot;, in which the processor works on multiple instructions in different stages of completion. For example, the processor may be retrieving the operands for the next instruction while calculating the result of the current one. Modern CPUs may use over a dozen such stages. [[Misc|MISC]] processors achieve single-cycle execution of instructions without the need for pipelining.

A similar idea, introduced only a few years later, was to execute multiple instructions in parallel on separate arithmetic-logic units ([[ALU]]s). Instead of operating on only one instruction at a time, the CPU will look for several similar instructions that are not dependent on each other, and execute them in parallel. This approach is known as [[superscalar]] processor design.

Such techniques are limited by the degree of [[instruction level parallelism]] (ILP), the number of non-dependent instructions in the program code. Some programs are able to run very well on superscalar processors due to their inherent high ILP, notably graphics. However more general problems do not have such high ILP, thus making the achievable speedups due to these techniques to be lower.

Branching is one major culprit.  For example, the program might add two numbers and branch to a different code segment if the number is bigger than a third number. In this case even if the branch operation is sent to the second ALU for processing, it still must wait for the results from the addition.  It thus runs no faster than if there were only one ALU. The most common solution for this type of problem is to use a type of [[branch prediction]].

To further the efficiency of multiple functional units which are available in superscalar designs, operand register dependencies was found to be another limiting factor. To minimize these dependencies, [[out-of-order execution]] of instructions was introduced.  In such a scheme, the instruction results which complete out-of-order must be re-ordered in program order by the processor for the program to be restartable after an exception. ''Out-of-Order'' execution was the main advancement of the computer industry during the [[1990s]].
A similar concept is [[speculative execution]], where instructions from both sides of a branch are executed at the same time, and the results of one side or the other are thrown out once the branch answer is known.

These advances, which were originally developed from research for RISC-style designs, allow modern CISC processors to execute twelve or more instructions per clock cycle, when traditional CISC designs could take twelve or more cycles to execute just one instruction.

The resulting instruction scheduling logic of these processors is large, complex and difficult to verify.  Furthermore, the higher complexity requires more transistors, increasing power consumption and heat. In this respect RISC is superior because the instructions are simpler, have less interdependence and make superscalar implementations easier. However, as Intel has demonstrated, the concepts can be applied to a CISC design, given enough time and money.

:Historical note: Some of these techniques (e.g. pipelining) were originally developed in the late [[1950s]] by [[International Business Machines|IBM]] on their [[IBM 7030|Stretch]] mainframe computer.

=== 1990 to today: looking forward ===

====VLIW and EPIC====

The instruction scheduling logic that makes a superscalar processor is just boolean logic. In the early 1990s, a significant innovation was to realize that the coordination of a multiple-ALU computer could be moved into the [[compiler]], the software that translates a programmer's instructions into machine-level instructions.

This type of computer is called a '''[[very long instruction word]]''' (VLIW) computer.

Statically scheduling the instructions in the compiler (as opposed to letting the processor do the scheduling dynamically) can reduce CPU complexity. This can improve performance, reduce heat, and reduce cost.

Unfortunately, the compiler lacks accurate knowledge of runtime scheduling issues. Merely changing the CPU core frequency multiplier will have an effect on scheduling. Actual operation of the program, as determined by input data, will have major effects on scheduling. To overcome these severe problems a VLIW system may be enhanced by adding the normal dynamic scheduling, losing some of the VLIW advantages.

Static scheduling in the compiler also assumes that dynamically generated code will be uncommon. Prior to the creation of [[Java_virtual_machine|Java]], this was in fact true. It was reasonable to assume that slow compiles would only affect software developers. Now, with [[Just-in-time_compilation|JIT]] virtual machines for Java and [[.net]], slow code generation affects users as well.

There were several unsuccessful attempts to commercialize VLIW. The basic problem is that a VLIW computer does not scale to different price and performance points, as a dynamically scheduled computer can. Another issue is that compiler design for VLIW computers is extremely difficult, and the current crop of compilers (as of 2005) don't always produce optimal code for these platforms.

Also, VLIW computers optimise for throughput, not low latency, so they were not attractive to the engineers designing controllers and other computers embedded in machinery. The [[embedded system]]s markets had often pioneered other computer improvements by providing a large market that did not care about compatibility with older software.

In January [[2000]], a company called [[Transmeta]] took the interesting  
step of placing a compiler in the central processing unit, and making the compiler translate from a reference byte code (in their case, [[x86]] instructions) to an internal VLIW instruction set.  This approach
combines the hardware simplicity, low power and speed of VLIW RISC with   
the compact main memory system and software reverse-compatibility provided
by popular CISC.

[[Intel]] released a chip, called the [[Itanium]], based on what they call an [[Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing]] (EPIC) design.  This design supposedly provides the VLIW advantage of increased instruction throughput.  However, it avoids some of the issues of scaling and complexity, by explicitly providing in each &quot;bundle&quot; of instructions information concerning their dependencies. This information is calculated by the compiler, as it would be in a VLIW design. The early versions are also backward-compatible with current [[x86]] software by means of an on-chip [[emulation]] mode. Integer performance has been disappointing as have sales in volume markets.

====Multi-threading====

Current designs work best when the computer is running only a single program, however nearly all modern [[operating system]]s allow the user to run multiple programs at the same time.  For the CPU to change over and do work on another program  requires expensive [[context switching]].  In contrast, multi-threaded CPUs can handle instructions from multiple programs at once.

To do this, such CPUs include several sets of registers. When a context switch occurs, the contents of the &quot;working registers&quot; are simply copied into one of a set of registers for this purpose. 

Such designs often include thousands of registers instead of hundreds as in a typical design. On the downside, registers tend to be somewhat expensive in chip space needed to implement them.  This chip space might otherwise be used for some other purpose.

====Multi-core====
Multi-core CPUs are typically multiple cpus on the same die possibly sharing the same cache to main memory and sharing the same bus to talk to other devices and to talk to eachother.

====Reconfigurable logic====

Another track of development is to combine reconfigurable logic with a general-purpose CPU.  In this scheme, a special computer language compiles fast-running subroutines into a bit-mask to configure the logic.  Slower, or less-critical parts of the program can be run by sharing their time on the CPU.  This process has the capability to create devices such as software [[radio]]s, by using digital signal processing to perform functions usually performed by analog [[electronics]].

====Public domain processors====

As the lines between hardware and software increasingly blur due to progress in design methodology and availability of chips such as [[FPGA]]s and cheaper production processes, even [[open source hardware]] has begun to appear.  Loosely-knit communities like [[OpenCores]] have recently announced completely open CPU architectures such as the [[OpenRISC]] which can be readily implemented on FPGAs or in custom produced chips, by anyone, without paying license fees.

====High-end processor economics====

Developing new, high-end CPUs is a '''very''' expensive proposition. Both the logical complexity (needing very large logic design and logic verification teams and simulation farms with perhaps thousands of computers) and the high operating frequencies (needing large circuit design teams and access to the state-of-the-art fabrication process) account for the high cost of design for this type of chip. The design cost of a high-end CPU will be on the order of US $100 million. Since the design of such high-end chips nominally take about five years to complete, to stay competitive a company has to fund at least two of these large design teams to release products at the rate of 2.5 years per product generation. Only the personal computer mass market (with production rates in the hundreds of millions, producing billions of dollars in revenue) can support such economics. As of 2004, only four companies are actively designing and fabricating state of the art general purpose computing CPU chips: [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[IBM]] and [[Fujitsu]].  [[Motorola]] has spun off its semiconductor division as [[Freescale]] as that division was dragging down profit margins for the rest of the company.  [[Texas Instruments]], [[TSMC]] and [[Toshiba]] are a few examples of a companies doing manufacturing for another company's CPU chip design.

== Embedded design ==

The majority of computer systems in use today are embedded in other machinery, such as telephones, clocks, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure.  An [[embedded system]] usually has minimal requirements for memory and program length and may require simple but unusual input/output systems.  For example, most embedded systems lack keyboards, screens, disks, printers, or other recognizable I/O devices of a personal computer.  They may control electric motors, relays or voltages, and reed switches, variable resistors or other electronic devices.  Often, the only I/O device readable by a human is a single light-emitting diode, and severe cost or power constraints can even eliminate that.

In contrast to general-purpose computers, embedded systems often seek to minimize [[interrupt latency]] over instruction throughput.

When an electronic device causes an interrupt, the intermediate results, the registers, have to be saved before the software responsible for handling the interrupt can run, and then must be put back after it is finished.  If there are more registers, this saving and restoring process takes more time, increasing the latency.

Low-latency CPUs generally have relatively few registers in their central processing units, or they have &quot;shadow registers&quot; that are only used by the interrupt software.

=== Other design issues ===

==== Optical communication ====
&lt;!-- [[virtual memory]] moved to [[Computer architecture]] --&gt;

One interesting near-term possibility would be to eliminate the [[front side bus]].  Modern vertical [[laser diode]]s enable this change.  In theory, an optical computer's components could directly connect through a holographic or phased open-air switching system.  This would provide a large increase in effective speed and design flexibility, and a large reduction in cost.  Since a computer's connectors are also its most likely failure point, a busless system might be more reliable, as well.

==== Optical processors ====
Another farther-term possibility is to use light instead of electricity for the digital logic itself.
In theory, this could run about 30% faster and use less power, as well as permit a direct interface with quantum computational devices.
The chief problem with this approach is that for the foreseeable future, electronic devices are faster, smaller (i.e. cheaper) and more reliable.
An important theoretical problem is that electronic computational elements are already smaller than some wavelengths of light, and therefore even wave-guide based optical logic may be uneconomic compared to electronic logic.
The majority of development effort, [[as of 2006]] is focused on electronic circuitry.
See also [[optical computing]].

==== Clockless CPUs ====

&lt;!--
Should I move this &quot;clockless&quot; stuff to
[[asynchronous circuit]],
leaving only a couple of sentences of summary and a link to that article
?
Or is this big enough to fork off its own article,
[[clockless CPU]]s ?
--&gt;
Yet another possibility is the &quot;clockless CPU&quot; (asynchronous CPU).  Unlike conventional processors, clockless processors have no central clock to coordinate the progress of data through the pipeline.
Instead, stages of the CPU are coordinated using logic devices called &quot;pipe line controls&quot; or &quot;FIFO sequencers.&quot;  Basically, the pipeline controller clocks the next stage of logic when the existing stage is complete.  In this way, a central clock is unnecessary. There are two advantages to clockless CPUs over clocked CPUs:
* components can run at different speeds in the clockless CPU.  In a clocked CPU, no component can run faster than the clock rate.
* In a clocked CPU, the clock can go no faster than the worst-case performance of the slowest stage. In a clockless CPU, when a stage finishes quicker than normal, the next stage can immediately take the results rather than waiting for the next clock tick. A stage might finish quicker than normal because of the particular data inputs (multiplication can be very fast if it is multiplying by 0 or 1), or because it is running at a higher voltage or lower temperature than normal.

Two examples of asynchronous CPUs are the [[ARM_architecture|ARM]]-implementing [[AMULET_microprocessor|AMULET]] and the asynchronous implementation of [[MIPS_architecture|MIPS]] R3000, dubbed [http://www.async.caltech.edu/mips.html MiniMIPS].

The biggest disadvantage of the clockless CPU is that most CPU design tools assume a clocked CPU (a [[synchronous circuit]]), so making a clockless CPU (designing an [[asynchronous circuit]]) involves modifying the design tools to handle clockless logic and doing extra testing to ensure the design avoids [[Metastability in electronics|metastable]] problems.  For example, the group that designs the aforementioned AMULET developed a tool called [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/apt/projects/tools/lard/ LARD] to cope with the complex design of AMULET3.

==== Soft microprocessors ====
''See article [[Soft microprocessor]]''

==Design concepts==
In general, all processors, micro or otherwise, run the same sort of task over and over:

#read an instruction and decode it
#find any associated data that is needed to process the instruction
#process the instruction
#write the results out

Complicating this simple-looking series of events is the fact that [[main memory]] has always been slower than the processor itself. Step (2) often introduces a lengthy (in CPU terms) delay while the data arrives over the [[computer bus]]. A considerable amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible. This often requires complex circuitry and was at one time found only on hand-wired [[supercomputer]] designs. However, as the manufacturing processes have improved, they have become a common feature of almost all designs.

===RISC===
The basic concept of [[RISC]] is to clearly identify what step 2 does. In older processor designs, now retroactively known as [[CISC]], the instructions were offered in a number of different modes that meant that step 2 took an unknown length of time to complete. In RISC, almost all instructions come in exactly one mode that reads data from one place -- the registers. These ''addressing modes'' are then handled by the [[compiler]], which writes code to load the data into the registers and store it back out. For this reason the term '''load-store''' is often used to describe this philosophy in design; there are many processors with limited instruction sets that are not really RISC.

The side effect of this change is twofold. One is that the resulting logic core is much smaller, largely by making step 1 and 2 much simpler. Secondly it means that step 2 always takes one cycle, also reducing the complexity of the overall chip design which would otherwise require complex &quot;locks&quot; that ensure the processor completes one instruction before starting the other. For any given level of performance, a RISC design will have a much smaller &quot;gate count&quot; (number of transistors), the main driver in overall cost -- in other words a fast RISC chip is much cheaper than a fast CISC chip.

The downside is that the program gets much longer as a side effect of the compiler having to write out explicit instructions for memory handling, the &quot;code density&quot; is lower. This increases the number of instructions that have to be read over the computer bus. When RISC was first being introduced there were arguments that the increased bus access would overwhelm the speed, and that such designs would actually be slower. In theory this might be true, but the real reason for RISC was to allow [[instruction pipeline]]s to be built much more easily.

===Instruction pipelining===
One of the first, and most powerful, techniques to improve performance is the [[instruction pipeline]]. Early microcoded designs would carry out all of the steps above for one instruction before moving onto the next. Large portions of the circuitry were left idle at any one step, for instance, the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on.

Pipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time. In the same basic example, the processor would start to decode (step 1) a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results. This would allow up to four instructions to be &quot;in flight&quot; at one time, making the processor look four times as fast. Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete, there's still four steps, the CPU as a whole &quot;retires&quot; instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed.

RISC make pipelines smaller, and much easier to construct by cleanly separating each stage of the instruction process and making them take the same amount of time -- one cycle. The processor as a whole operates in an [[assembly line]] fashion, with instructions coming in one side and results out the other. Due to the reduced complexity of the [[Classic RISC pipeline]], the pipelined core and an instruction cache could be placed on the same size die that would otherwise fit the core alone on a CISC design. This was the real reason that RISC was faster, early designs like the [[SPARC]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] often running over 10 times as fast as [[Intel]] and [[Motorola]] CISC solutions at the same clock speed and price.

Pipelines are by no means limited to RISC designs.  By 1986 the top-of-the-line VAX (the 8800) was a heavily pipelined design, slightly predating the first commercial MIPS and SPARC designs.  Most modern CPUs (even embedded CPUs) are now pipelined, and microcoded CPUs with no pipelining are seen only in the most area-constrained embedded processors.  Large CISC machines, from the VAX 8800 to the modern Pentium 4 and Athlon, are implemented with both microcode and pipelines.  Improvements in pipelining and caching are the two major microarchitectural advances that have enabled processor performance to keep pace with the circuit technology on which they are based.

===Cache===
It was not long before improvements in chip manufacturing allowed for even more circuitry to be placed on the die, and designers started looking for ways to use it. One of the most common was to add an ever-increasing amount of [[CPU cache|cache memory]] on-die. Cache is simply very fast memory, memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as opposed to &quot;many&quot; needed to talk to main memory. The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache, if the data is already in the cache it simply &quot;appears&quot;, whereas if it is not the processor is &quot;stalled&quot; while the cache controller reads it in.

RISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s, often only 4k in total. This number grew over time, and modern CPU's typically include about 512kbytes, while CPU's intended for server use come with 1 or 2 Mbytes. Generally speaking, more cache means more speed.

===Superscalar designs===
Even with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above, chip manufacturing had soon made even them have room left over. This led to the rise of [[superscalar]] processors in the early 1990s, processors that could run more than one instruction at once.

In the outline above the processor runs parts of a single instruction at a time. If one were simply to place two entire cores on a die, then the processor would be able to run two instructions at once. However this is not actually required, as in the average program certain instructions are much more common than others. For instance, the load-store instructions on a RISC design are more common than [[floating point]], so building two complete cores isn't as efficient a use of space as building two load-store units and only one floating point.

In modern designs it is common to find two load units, one store (many instructions have no results to store), two or more integer math units, two or more floating point units, and often a [[SIMD]] unit of some sort. The decoder grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different units that are idle at that point. The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end, as in out-of-order.

===Out-of-order execution===
The addition of caches reduces the frequency of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the memory hiearchy, but does
get rid of these stalls entirely. In early designs a ''cache miss'' would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait. Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data ''is'' available in the cache at that point. [[Out-of-order execution]] allows that ready instruction to be processed while the processor waits on the cache, then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the normal order.


===Speculative execution===
One problem with an instruction pipeline is that there are a class of instructions that must make their way entirely through the pipeline before execution can continue. In particular, conditional branches need to know the result of some prior instruction before &quot;which side&quot; of the branch to run is known. For instance, an instruction that says &quot;if x is larger than 5 then do this, otherwise do that&quot; will have to wait for the results of x to be known before it knows if the instructions for this or that can be fetched.

For a small four-deep pipeline this means a delay of up to three cycles -- the decode can still happen. But as clock speeds increase the depth of the pipeline increases with it, and modern processors may have 20 stages or more. In this case the CPU is being stalled for the vast majority of its cycles every time one of these instructions is encountered.

The solution, or one of them, is ''[[speculative execution]]'', also known as ''branch prediction''. In reality one side or the other of the branch will be called much more often than the other, so it is often correct to simply go ahead and say &quot;x will likely be smaller than five, start processing that&quot;. If the prediction turns out to be correct, a huge amount of time will be saved. Modern designs have rather complex prediction systems, which watch the results of past branches to predict the future with greater accuracy.


===Multiprocessing and Multithreading===
Computer architects have become stymied by the growing mismatch in CPU operating frequencies and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] access times. None of the techniques that exploited instruction-level parallism within one program could make up for the long stalls that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory. For this reason, newer generations of computers have started to exploit higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or [[thread (computer science)|program thread]]. 

This trend is sometimes known as ''throughput computing''. This idea originated in the mainframe market where [[OLTP|online transaction processing]] emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction, but the capacity to deal with massive
numbers of transactions. With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing
in the last decade, the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues. 

One technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through [[multiprocessing]] systems, computer systems with multiple CPUs. 
Once reserved for high-end [[mainframe]]s and [[supercomputer]]s, small scale (2-8) multiprocessors servers have become commonplace 
for the small business market. For large corporations, large scale (16-256) multiprocessors are common. Even [[personal computer]]s
with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s. 

With further transistor size reductions made available with semiconductor technology advances, [[Chip-level multiprocessing]] have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip. Initially used in chips targeting embedded markets, where
simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon. By 2005, semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs ''CMP'' chips to be manufactured in volume. Some designs, such as [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[UltraSPARC T1]] have reverted back to simpler (scalar, in-order) designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon.     

Another technique that has become more popular recently is [[multithreading]]. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory, instead of stalling for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute. Though this doesn't speed up a particular program/thread, it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle.

Conceptually, multithreading  is equivalent to a [[context switch]] at the operating system level. The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires. This is achieved by replicating the state hardware (such as the [[register file]] and [[program counter]]) for
each active thread. 

A further enhancement is [[Simultaneous multithreading]]. This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from
different programs/threads simultaneously in the same cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In phylogenetic taxonomy, the '''Carinatae''' are considered the last common ancestor of Neornithes (living [[bird]]s) and [[Ichthyornis]] (an extinct seabird of the [[Cretaceous]]). Defined in this way, the group includes all living [[bird]]s, including [[ratite]]s ([[ostrich]], [[emu]], etc.), as well as neognathous birds and a few [[Mesozoic]] forms. 

Traditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds having a [[keel (bird)|keeled]] [[sternum]]. The carina or &quot;keel&quot; referred to a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum, or breast bone. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced carina. Ratites, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong carina. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates and ratites. The difficulty with this scheme was that there have been (and still are) any number of flightless birds, without strong carinae, but which are descended directly from ordinary flying birds with carinae. Examples include the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], a galliform (chicken-like) bird, and the [[dodo]], a columbiform (the [[pigeon]] family). None of these birds are ratites. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship. 

Unfortunately, the use of this term to describe the Ichthyornis-Neornithine group turned out to be equally inapt. Various dinosaurs -- apparently, remote ancestors and cousins of the Carinatae -- '''do''' possess a keeled sternum. So, evidently the presence of this structure does not necessarily imply its use in [[flight]]. This sort of definitional problem is one reason why the use of physical characteristics to define or name taxonomic groups is now discouraged.

The characteristics that actually are unique to the Carinatae have little to do with the sternum. Rather, carinates are unique in having, for example, a globe-shaped, convex head on the [[humerus]] and fully fused bones in the lower leg and outer arm.

[[Image:Cocktail1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cocktail.]]
In general, a '''cocktail''' is a mix of several substances, usually liquids. 

This article describes the '''cocktail''' as a mixed [[drink]], usually containing one or more [[distillation|distilled]] [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic beverages]] and perhaps non-alcoholic drinks, [[ice]] and sometimes [[liqueur]], [[fruit]], sauce, [[honey]], milk or cream, [[spice|spices]], etc.  The cocktail became popular during [[Prohibition]] in the [[United States]]; to mask the taste of [[bootlegging|bootlegged]] alcohol, the bartenders at a [[speakeasy]] would mix it with other liquors and non-alcoholic drinks.

Until the [[1970s]], cocktails were made predominantly with [[gin]], [[whiskey]], or [[rum]], and rarely [[vodka]]. From the 1970s on, the popularity of vodka increased dramatically. By the [[1980s]] it was the predominant base for mixed drinks. Many cocktails traditionally made with gin, such as the [[gimlet (cocktail)|gimlet]], may now be served by default with vodka.

Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages that are used nearly exclusively in cocktails (or in non-alcoholic soda fountain drinks, such as the [[egg cream]]) include [[soda water]], [[tonic water]] and [[seltzer]]. [[Liqueurs]] are also common cocktail ingredients.

==History==
[[Image:Flaming cocktails.jpg|thumb|left|250px|&quot;Flaming&quot; cocktails contain a small amount of flammable [[alcoholic proof|high-proof alcohol]] which is ignited prior to consumption.]]
The earliest known printed use of the word &quot;cocktail&quot; was in the [[May 13]], [[1806]] edition of the ''Balance and Columbian Repository'' (A [[Hudson, New York]] publication), where the paper provided the following answer to what a cocktail was: 
:''&quot;Cocktail is a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters--it is vulgarly called a bittered sling and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, inasmuch as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a [[United_States_Democratic-Republican_Party|Democratic]] candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow anything else.&quot;''

The first publication of a [[bartender]]s' guide which included cocktail recipes was in [[1862]]: ''How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion'', by Professor Jerry Thomas. In addition to listings of recipes for Punches, Sours, Slings, Cobblers, Shrubs, Toddies, Flips, and a variety of other types of mixed drinks were 10 recipes for drinks referred to as &quot;Cocktails&quot;. A key ingredient which differentiated &quot;cocktails&quot; from other drinks in this compendium, was the use of [[bitters]] as an ingredient, although it is not to be seen in very many modern cocktail recipes.

During Prohibition in the United States ([[1919]]-[[1933]]), when alcohol consumption was illegal, cocktails were still consumed in establishments known as speakeasies. Not only was the quality of the alcohol available far lower than was previously used, but the skill and knowledge of the bartenders would also decline significantly during this time.
 
==Etymology==
There are several plausible theories as to the origin of the term &quot;cocktail&quot;. Among them are:
*Some say that it was customary to put a feather (presumably from a cock's tail) in the drink to serve both as decoration and to signal to [[teetotaler]]s that the drink contained [[ethanol|alcohol]]. 
*Another etymology is that the term is derived from ''coquetier'', a French [[egg-cup]] which was used to serve the beverage in [[New Orleans]] in the early 19th century.
*The word could also be a distortion of Latin ''[aqua] decocta'', meaning &quot;distilled water&quot;.

==Derivative uses==
The word &quot;cocktail&quot; is sometimes figuratively been used for a mixture of (not necessarily drinkable) liquids or other substances, for example: &quot;''120 years of industry have dosed the area's soil with a noxious cocktail of heavy metals and chemical contaminants''&quot;.

'''Coptic Orthodox Christianity''' is the indigenous form of [[Christianity]] that, according to tradition, the apostle [[St. Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] established in [[Egypt]] in the middle of the [[1st century]] AD (approximately [[42]]). The Church belongs to the [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Alexandria]] in Coptic Christianity has been a distinct church body since the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in [[451]]. Her leader is the [[List of Coptic Popes|Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of the Holy See of Saint Mark]], currently [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]]. More than 95% of Egypt's Christians belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, but other &quot;Patriarchates/Patriarchs of Alexandria&quot; also exist (Coptic Catholic, Greek/Latin Catholic and Greek Orthodox - see 'Coptic Christianity Today' below).


==History==
[[Egypt]] is often identified as the place of refuge that the [[Holy Family]] sought in its [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/The_Holy_Family_in_Egypt flight] from [[Judea]]: &quot;When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of [[Herod the Great]], that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, ''Out of Egypt I called My Son''&quot; ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 2:12-23). The Egyptian Church, which is now more than nineteen centuries old, was the subject of many prophecies in the [[Old Testament]]. [[Isaiah]] the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says &quot;In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.&quot;

The first [[Christian]]s in Egypt were mainly [[Alexandria]]n [[Jew]]s such as [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], whom [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke the Evangelist]] addresses in the introductory chapter of his [[Gospel of Luke|gospel]]. When the church was founded by [[Saint Mark|Mark]] during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Nero]], a great multitude of native Egyptians (as opposed to Greeks or Jews) embraced the Christian faith. [[Christianity]] spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Mark's arrival in Alexandria as is clear from the [[New Testament]] writings found in [[Oxyrhynchus|Bahnasa]], in [[Middle Egypt]], which date around the year 200 AD, and a fragment of the [[Gospel of John|Gospel of Saint John]], written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], which was found in [[Upper Egypt]] and can be dated to the first half of the second century. In the [[2nd century|second century]] [[Christianity]] began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local language, namely [[Coptic Language|Coptic]].

===The Catechetical School of Alexandria, Egypt===
The Catechetical School of Alexandria is the oldest catechetical school in the world. Founded around 190 by the scholar [[Pantanaeus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and the great [[Origen]], who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. Origen wrote over 6,000 commentaries of the [[Bible]] in addition to his famous [[Hexapla]]. Many scholars such as [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]] visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question and answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before [[Braille]], wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.

The Theological college of the catechetical school of Alexandria was re-established in 1893. The new school currently has campuses in Alexandria, [[Cairo]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Los Angeles]], where Coptic priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among other subjects Christian theology, history, [[Coptic language]] and art - including chanting, music, [[iconography]], and tapestry.

===Egyptian origin of the cross symbol===
[[Image:Coptic_bust.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Coptic bust from the transition period, as the ankh become &quot;christianized&quot;. Found in the Fayeum in the 1950s. {{3d_glasses}}]]
For over 2500 years the pagan symbol of the ankh cross was a ubiquitous symbol of spiritual life. Unlike most Egyptian sacred images, it was not a human-like god with the head of an animal, or even the disk of Sun, but a pure symbol of deity. It was not hard to see how that ageless symbol would somehow become connected to a faith, centered around a man who had been executed on another kind of cross. That man, Jesus, was believed by his followers to be the Son of the one and only God. Egypt had long associated the ankh cross with all that was unknowable and trandscendant in their poly-theistic faith. Everywhere else in the Roman influenced world, a cross was merely an implement of execution for slaves and enemies of the Roman state. It was very degrading to connect the memory of the Christian &quot;Savior&quot;, to something that conotated an ignoble and lingering death. The ankh provided a  means to bring the cross into the &quot;pantheon&quot; of Christian symbolism, after 250 years of rejection by the Jewish and Greek followers of Jesus.{{fact}}

===Monasticism and missionary work===
In the [[3rd century|third century]], during the persecution of [[Decius]], some Christians fled to the desert, and remained there to pray after the persecutions abated. This was the beginning of the [[Monasticism|monastic movement]], which was reorganized by [[Saint Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great]] and [[Pachomius]] in the [[4th century]]. By the end of the century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian hills. A number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations till this day.

Egyptian monasticism attracted the attention of Christians in other parts of the world, who visited Egypt, many bringing monastic ideas home with them, and spreading monasticism through the Christian world. [[Saint Basil|Basil]], organizer of the monastic movement in [[Asia Minor]] visited Egypt around AD [[357]] and his rule is followed by the eastern Churches; Jerome, en route to [[Jerusalem]], stopped in Egypt and left details of his experiences in his letters; [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] founded monasteries in the [[6th century]] on the model of Pachomius, but in a stricter form.

===Council of Nicea===
In the 4th century, a [[Libya]]n priest called [[Arianism|Arius]] started a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Council of Nicea]] ([[325]]) was convened by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] to resolve the dispute and eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was authored by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius the Apostolic]], the Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria.

===Council of Constantinople===
In the year [[381]], [[Timothy I of Alexandria]] presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]], which completed the [[Nicene Creed]] with this confirmation of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]]: 

:&quot;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Life-giver, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in one Holy Universal Apostolic Church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen.&quot;

===Council of Ephesus===
[[Image:CopticAltar.jpg|thumb|left|Coptic Altar in Jerusalem]]
Another theological dispute in the [[5th century]] occurred over the teachings of [[Nestorius]], a Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not [[hypostatically]] joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title &quot;Mother of God&quot; ''([[Theotokos]])'' to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], declaring her instead to be &quot;Mother of Christ&quot; ''(Christotokos)''. When reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]], the Coptic Pope (Cyril I) acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent.  When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope  [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]], supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as &quot;The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius.&quot; This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: &quot;The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril.&quot; In these [[anathema]]s, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, &quot;Anyone who dares to deny the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Holy Virgin]] the title ''Theotokos'' is Anathema!&quot; Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the [[First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus]] ([[431]]), over which Cyril presided.

The [[First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus]] confirmed the teachings of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]] and confirmed the title of the Holy Ever-Virgin Mary as &quot;Mother of God&quot;. It also clearly stated that anyone who separated [[Christ]] into two hypostases was anathema, as Athanasius  had said that there is &quot;One Nature and One Hypostasis for God the Word Incarnate&quot; (Mia Physis kai Mia Hypostasis tou Theou Logou Sasarkomeni). Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows:

:&quot;We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God ''(Theotokos)'' for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firminess of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen.&quot;

The Orthodox faith is considered to have prevailed at the council. Unfortunately, Cyril of Alexandria died soon afterwards. [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Saint Dioscorus]], the archdeacon of Alexandria (considered a saint by the non-Chalcedonians but a heretic by the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics) was elected as Cyril's replacement. The Nestorians took the opportunity of Cyril's death to revive their campaign against Cyrillian Christology.

===Council of Chalcedon===
[[Image:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|St Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]
By the time the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was called, politics had already started to intermingle with Church affairs. When the Emperor [[Marcianus]] interfered with matters of faith in the Church, the response of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Saint Dioscorus]], the Pope of Alexandria who was later to be exiled, to this interference was clear: &quot;You have nothing to do with the Church.&quot; It was at [[Chalcedon]] that the emperor would take his revenge for the Pope's frankness.

The [[Council of Chalcedon]] abandoned Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, &quot;Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary,&quot; thus the foundation according to non-Chalcedonians is made clear. In terms of Christology the Oriental understanding is that Christ is &quot;One Nature--the Logos Incarnate,&quot; ''of'' the full humanity and full divinity. The Byzantine understanding is that Christ is ''in'' two natures, full humanity and full divinity. (Just as all of us are of our mother and father and not in our mother and father, so too is the nature of Christ. If Christ is in full humanity and in full divinity, then He is separate in two persons as the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] teach. Imagine your nature in your mother and your father; you are then two different people. If however your nature is of your mother and your father, then you are one person [http://www.geocities.com/mfignatius/others/byzantine01.html].) This is the linguistic difference which separated the Orientals from the Byzantines. 

The Council's finding were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the [[Byzantine Empire]]: Egyptians, [[Syria]]ns, [[Armenia]]ns, and others. From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the &quot;[[Melkite]]&quot; or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the [http://www.greekorthodox-alexandria.org/ Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria], and the non-Chalcedonian national truly Egyptian one, now known as the [[List of Coptic Popes|Coptic Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and Apostolic See of St. Mark]]. Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the national Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Church). Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in [[Full communion|communion]] with the other leading churches of [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]]. The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]].

The Coptic Church regards herself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. Some Copts believe that perhaps the Council understood the Church correctly, but wanted to exile the Church, to isolate her and to abolish the Egyptian, independent Pope, who maintained that Church and State should remain separate. The Coptic Church regarded that the ousting of Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria in the council of Chalcedon was in part due to the rivalry between the Bishops of Alexandria and Rome. The Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was considered influenced by Nestorian philosophy. It is important to note that Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons. Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council in which he was ousted, which apparently was a result of the conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates. For further info, please refer to [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm this key paper] on the subject by Professor Fr. [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/John_S._Romanides John S. Romanides], a prominent Greek Orthodox scholar.

Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians &quot;[[Monophysitism|monophysites]]&quot;, though the Coptic Church denies that she teaches monophysitism, which she has always regarded as a heresy. They have sometimes called the Chalcedonian group &quot;[[Dyophysitism|dyophysites]]&quot;.  A term that comes closer to Coptic doctrine is &quot;[[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]]&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaphysitism], which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Church believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called &quot;the nature of the incarnate word&quot;, which was reiterated by [[Cyril of Alexandria|Saint Cyril of Alexandria]]. Copts, thus, believe in two natures &quot;human&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; that are united in one hypostasis ''without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration''. These two natures ''did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye'' (Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea).

===From Chalcedon to the Arab conquest of Egypt===
Copts suffered under the rule of the Byzantine [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The Melkite Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred the Egyptian population whom they considered heretics. Many Egyptians were tortured and martyred to accept the terms of Chalcedon, but Egyptians remained loyal to the faith of their fathers and to the Cyrillian view of [[Christology]]. One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of that period is [[Saint Samuel the Confessor]].

===The Arab conquest of Egypt===
The [[Arab]] conquest of Egypt took place in AD [[641]]. Although the Imperial forces resisted the Arab army under [[Amr ibn al-As]], the majority of the civilian population, having suffered persecution for the differing Christian beliefs, were less hostile. Considered &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot;, Christians were allowed to practice their religion, under the protection of the Islamic [[Shari'a]] law. This protection stemmed in part from a [[Hadith]] of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] (whose [[Muhammad's marriages|Egyptian wife]] ''Maria'' had borne him a son who died in infancy, named Ibrahim) that advised &quot;When you conquer Egypt, be kind to the Copts for they are your proteges and kith and kin&quot; .

Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained a mainly Christian land, although gradual conversions to Islam over the centuries and the massive immigration of Arabs had the effect of changing Egypt from a mainly Christian to a mainly [[Muslim]] country by the end of the [[12th century]]. This process was sped along by persecutions during and following the reign of the mad [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (reigned AD 996-1021) and the [[Crusades]], and also by the acceptance of Arabic as a liturgical language by the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] [[Pope Gabriel II of Alexandria|Gabriel ibn-Turaik]].

===From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution===
The position of the Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s dynasty. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit and, by [[1855]], the main mark of Copts' inferiority, the ''Jizya'' tax, was lifted. Shortly thereafter, Christians started to serve in the Egyptian army. The [[1919 revolution]] in Egypt, the first grassroots display of Egyptian identity in centuries, stands as a witness to the homogeneity of Egypt's modern society with both its Muslim and Christian components.

==Coptic Christianity today==
[[Image:Monastry3.jpg|frame|left|A modern Coptic monastery.]]
The current Coptic Orthodox [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of the Holy See of Saint Mark]] is [[Pope Shenouda III]] (his title should not be confused with that of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]]). The most recent Greek-Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria is [[Patriarch Theodoros II of Alexandria|Theodoros II]] [http://www.greekorthodox-alexandria.org/main.htm]. There is a small [[Coptic Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Rite]] Catholic) which is headed by a Patriarch of Alexandria. The [[Melkite Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Rite]] Catholic) has little presence in Egypt, but is headed by a Patriarch of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. There is also a [[List of Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]]. Small [[Protestant]] and [[Anglican]] denominations also exist.

By some accounts there are about 60 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in the world: they are found primarily in [[Egypt]] (roughly 15 million), [[Ethiopia]] (roughly 38 million [http://www2.wcc-coe.org/pressreleasesen.nsf/index/pr-05-55.html]), and [[Eritrea]] (roughly 2 million), but there are significant numbers in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Israel]], and in diaspora throughout the world making approximately another 3 to 4 million.  However, as applied to the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], which in 1959 was granted her first own Patriarch by Coptic [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]], the word ''Coptic'' can be considered a misnomer because it means ''Egyptian''.  The [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church]] similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Tewahedo Church during the 1990s.  These three churches remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches.

Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental Orthodox and Chalcedonian Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve the theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing (see [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Agreed_Official_Statements_on_Christology_with_the_Catholic_and_Eastern_Orthodox_Churches Agreed Official Statements on Christology with the Eastern Orthodox Churches]). In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Pastoral_Agreement_between_the_Coptic_Orthodox_and_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchates_of_Alexandria_%282001%29 agreed] to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making rebaptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other. Previously, if a Coptic and Greek wanted to marry, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, for it to be recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.

In the Coptic Church only men may be ordained, and they must be married before they are ordained, if they wish to be married. In this respect they follow the same practices as does the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

Traditionally, the [[Coptic language]] was used in church services, and the scriptures were written in the [[Coptic alphabet]].  However, due to the arabisation of Egypt, service in churches started to witness increased use of Arabic, while preaching is done entirely in Arabic. Native languages are used, in conjunction with Coptic, during services outside of Egypt.

Coptic Christians celebrate [[Christmas]] on the 7th of January which, since 2002, is an official national holiday in Egypt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Children of God''' (COG), later known as the '''Family of Love''', the '''Family''', and now '''The Family International''',  is a [[new religious movement]] that started in 1968 in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. It was a fringe element of the [[Jesus Movement]] of the late 1960s, with many of its early [[Religious conversion|converts]] drawn from the [[hippies|hippie movement]]. It was among the movements prompting the [[cult]] controversy of the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and Europe and triggered the first organized [[anti-cult movement|anticult]] group ([[FREECOG]]).

As it grew and expanded around the world, so did its message&amp;mdash;[[salvation]], [[apocalypticism]], spiritual &quot;revolution&quot; against the outside world that they called &quot;the System&quot;&amp;mdash;and resultant controversy. In 1974, it began to experiment with a method of [[evangelism]] called [[Flirty Fishing]]&amp;mdash;using sex to show God's love and win converts and support. The practice was discontinued in 1987. Their founder and prophetic leader, [[David Berg]], communicated with his followers via ''Mo Letters''&amp;mdash;letters of instruction and counsel on a myriad of spiritual and practical subjects&amp;mdash;until his death in late 1994. After his death, his widow [[Karen Zerby]] became the leader of the Family. 

The group’s liberal sexuality and its publication and distribution of writings, photographs and videos advocating and documenting adult-child sexual contact and the sexualization of children led to numerous reports of sexual contact between adults and minors. A number of judicial and academic investigations in the 1990s found the Family to be a safe environment for children, yet such investigations have also highlighted troubles in its past. Family leadership, admitting only that some children were abused from 1978 until 1986, created policies prohibiting excessive discipline or any sexual contact between adults and minors. Those found to have abused children after December 1988 are [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from Family membership.  The Family requires individuals who decide to report child abuse to a law enforcement agency or pursue any other legal action against an alleged abuser to leave the group entirely or, if the alleged abuser has been excommunicated for child abuse, to move to a lower commitment membership status until the matter is resolved.

The January 2005 murder of a former member by the leader's son [[Ricky Rodriguez]] (who had also left the group several years earlier) and his subsequent suicide shocked both members and former members, and led to considerable media attention.  

==Beliefs==
:''Main article: [[Beliefs of the Children of God]]'' 

Theologians have placed the Family's basic [[theology]] within the historical Christian tradition, along with some unorthodox beliefs. To some extent, they identify, and would be seen by most, as [[fundamentalist]] Christians, though some of their more radical beliefs and practices would certainly be regarded as non-traditional, even heretical, by most fundamentalist Christians, and indeed by most Christian theologians. 

The Family International states they believe the [[Bible]] to be the inspired Word of God and sacred revelation. [[David Berg]] is regarded as a [[prophet]] by them, in the understanding of one who passed on the message of God, not so much as a predictor of the future, though he frequently attempted to predict future events, for the most part inaccurately. They believe his &quot;mantle&quot; passed to his wife, Karen Zerby, at his death. They regard the officially published writings of both of them, but not everything they have written, as part of the ''Word of God''. While there is an understanding in the movement that all ''word'' is not on the same level of significance, nevertheless all ''word'' is important to read and take heed to.

They believe that the [[Great Commission]] of evangelizing the world is the duty of every Christian, and that their lives should be dedicated to the service of God and others. They have several levels of membership, and the most committed, &quot;Family Disciples,&quot; live communally. They also encourage the having of children. While birth control was initially highly discouraged, the choice is currently left to the individual and is not uncommon in practice.

A central tenet to their theology is the &quot;Law of Love,&quot; that, simply stated, maintains that if a person's actions are motivated by unselfish, sacrificial love and are not intentionally hurtful to others, such actions are in accordance with Scripture and are, thus, lawful in the eyes of God. They believe that this tenet supersedes all other biblical laws, except the ones forbidding male homosexuality, which they believe is an abomination. They believe that God created [[human sexuality]], that it is a natural, emotional, and physical need, and that [[heterosexual]] relations between consenting adults of legal age is a pure and natural wonder of God's creation, and permissible according to Scripture. Adult members may have sex with any other adult member of the opposite sex. Teenagers from the age of 16 are also allowed to have sex with other members under age 21. Since 1986, sex between minors and adults is strictly forbidden. Family members are strongly encouraged to have sex with any member who may be in need, commonly called &quot;sharing&quot; or &quot;sacrificial sex&quot;. No one is pressured to have sex against their will, but members who do not &quot;share&quot; are considered selfish and unloving.

In common with other apocalyptic and millenarian movements, they believe that they are now living in the time period known in Scripture as the &quot;[[Last Days]]&quot; or the &quot;Time of the End,&quot; which is the era immediately preceding the return of Jesus Christ. Before that event, they believe that the world will be ruled for seven years by a man known as the [[Antichrist]], who will create a one-world government. At the half-way point in his rule he will become completely possessed by [[Satan]], precipitating a time of troubles known as the [[Great Tribulation]] which will bring intense [[persecution]] of Christians as well as stupendous natural and unnatural disasters. At the end of this period, faithful Christians will be taken to heaven in an event known as the [[Rapture]] that is shortly followed by a battle between Jesus and the Antichrist commonly known as the &quot;Battle of [[Armageddon]]&quot;, in which the Antichrist is defeated. Jesus Christ reigns on Earth for 1000 years, a period they call the Millennium.

The Family's official statement of their beliefs can be found here: [http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/faith.htm]

===Recent Teachings===
The Family's recent teachings center around beliefs that they have termed the &quot;new [spiritual] weapons.&quot; The Family believes that they are soldiers in the [[spiritual warfare|spiritual war]] of [[Conflict Between Good and Evil|good versus evil]] for the souls and hearts of men. Although some of these beliefs are not new to the Family, they have assumed greater importance in recent years. These include:

[[Prophecy]]: In Family jargon, the traditional definition of ''prophecy''&amp;mdash;a prediction of the future&amp;mdash;has been expanded to refer to any message received from the &quot;spirit world&quot; from Jesus, deceased founder David Berg, or another &quot;spirit helper&quot; (see below). A great emphasis has been placed on each member using prophecy directly and regularly to guide their daily lives. Although prophecy, also referred to as &quot;[[channeling]],&quot; has been a part of the movement from the beginning, it has assumed greater significance in recent years. It has been noted by scholars that the Family is unique among new religious movements in its decentralization and democratization of divine guidance from God.

Spirit Helpers: These include [[angel]]s, departed humans, and even famous fictional characters, eg. Don Quixote, who are sent to give instruction and to fight in the spiritual warfare taking place in the spiritual dimension that Family members believe is coexistent with the physical world that surrounds them. These helpers are believed to relay the divine messages they receive in prophecy and also are engaged in spiritual combat with [[Satan]] and his demons.

The Keys of the Kingdom: The Family believes that the keys referred to in the Biblical passage &quot;and I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot; (Matthew 16:19), have assumed greater significance today. As such, Family members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for supposed extra effect during prayer. These keys are also believed to power various spacecraft, and can magically turn into swords for the purpose of fighting spiritual demons.

[[Loving Jesus]]: This is a term that members of the Family use to describe their intimate, sexual relationship with [[Jesus]]. The Family describes the &quot;Loving Jesus&quot; teachings as a radical form of [[bridal theology]] [http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/lj.htm]. It is their understanding of the Scriptures that the followers of Christ are His bride, called to love and serve Him with the fervor of a wife. They take bridal theology a step further than most Christians have by encouraging members to imagine that Jesus is having sex with them during sexual intercourse or masturbation. Male members are told to visualize themselves as women &quot;in the spirit&quot;, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus.

The Family continues to stress the imminent [[second coming|Second Coming of Christ]], preceded by the rise of a worldwide government led by the &quot;Antichrist&quot;. These doctrines regarding the &quot;[[End times|End Time]]&quot; influence virtually all long-term decision making.

==History==
===The Children of God (1968-1977)===
The founder of the movement was a former [[Christian Missionary Alliance]] pastor, [[David Berg|David Brandt Berg]] (1919-1994), also known within the group as Moses David, Mo, Father David, and Dad to adult group members and eventually as Grandpa to the group's youngest members. 

Members of the Children of God founded [[Intentional Community|communes]], first called &quot;colonies&quot;, but now referred to as &quot;Homes,&quot; in various cities around the world. They would [[proselytism|proselytize]] in the streets and distribute literature. New converts who joined the movement memorized [[scripture]], went through a course of Bible knowledge classes, and were expected to emulate the lives of early Christians while rejecting mainstream denominational Christianity. (See [[religious conversion]]) 

In common with converts to some other religions, and in keeping with Biblical custom, most incoming members adopted a [[name change|new &quot;Bible&quot; name]].

Berg communicated with his followers through his more than 3,000 published letters written over 24 years, referred to as &quot;Mo Letters&quot; by members of the group. By January 1972 David Berg introduced through his letters that he was God's prophet for this time, further establishing his spiritual authority within the group. Nonetheless, Berg freely acknowledged his failings and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, James (2000). &quot;Life in The Family:  An Oral History of the Children of God&quot;. ''University of Syracuse Press'', Syracuse, NY. pp. 64-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the end of 1972 COG members had distributed approximately 42 million Christian tracts, mostly on God’s Salvation and America’s doom. Street distribution of Berg’s Letters (called &quot;litnessing&quot;) became the COG's predominant method of outreach--as well as support--for the next five years.

The Children of God ended as an organizational entity in February 1978. Reports of serious misconduct, financial mismanagement, and abuse of their positions by a number of the established leaders, including the opposition of some to FFing ([[Flirty Fishing]]), caused Berg to reorganize the movement. He dismissed over 300 of the movement’s leaders and declared the general dissolution of the then existing COG structure. This shift was known as the &quot;Reorganization Nationalization Revolution&quot; (RNR). A third of the total membership left the movement, and those who remained became part of the reorganized movement, dubbed the &quot;Family of Love,&quot; and later, simply the &quot;Family.&quot; Most of the group's beliefs remained the same. &lt;ref name=Origins&gt; ''[http://www.thefamily.org/dossier/statements/origins.htm The Origins of a Movement: From &quot;The Children of God&quot; to &quot;The Family International&quot;]'', found on the official website&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Family of Love (1978-1981)===
The Family of Love era was characterised by movement of Family members into more countries. Regular witnessing methods included door to door, giving out tracts and other gospel literature, classes which included Family music as well as classes on various aspects of the Christian life. 
 
In 1974, David Berg introduced a new witnessing method called [[Flirty Fishing]] (or FFing), which allowed female members to physically express God's love by engaging in sexual activity with potential converts. It began as an experiment started as early as 1973 by members of Berg's inner circle and was eventually introduced to the rest of the membership.  By 1978, it was more widely practiced by members of the group. In some areas, Flirty Fishers used escort agencies to meet people. As in other witnessing methods, people who were reached through FF'ing supported the movement generously. Even though FF'ing was practised for a relatively short length of time, several people who were FF'd remain friends, supporters and well wishers to this day.

According to the Family, as a result of Flirty Fishing, ''&quot;over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a [[disciple]] and [[missionary]].&quot;''&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; According to data provided by the Family to researcher Bill Bainbridge, from 1974 until 1987 Family members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims (1996). &quot;The Sociology of Religious Movements&quot;. ''Routledge''. ISBN 0-4159-1202-4. pg 223&lt;/ref&gt; Flirty Fishing also resulted in the birth of many children, including Karen Zerby's son, Davidito (aka Rick Rodriguez). Children born as result of Flirty Fishing were referred to as &quot;Jesus Babies&quot;. By the end of 1981, over 300 &quot;Jesus Babies&quot; had been born. 

In an official statement on its origins, the Family International partly describes the practice of Flirty Fishing as follows:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted green;&quot;&gt;
In part as a response to the sexual liberality of the early '70s, Father David presented a more intimate and personal, voluntary form of evangelism, which became known as &quot;Flirty Fishing&quot; or &quot;FFing.&quot; ...Father David proposed that the boundaries of expressing God's love to others could at times go beyond just showing kindness and doing good deeds. He suggested that for those who were in dire need of physical love and affection, even sex could be used as evidence to them of the Lord's love. The motivation, guiding principle, and reasoning behind the FFing ministry was that through this sacrificial proof of love, some would better accept and understand God's great love for them. The goal was that they would come to believe in and receive God's own loving gift of salvation through His Son, Jesus, who gave His life for them. By this unorthodox method David felt many would find the Lord's love and salvation, who never would have otherwise.
Although we no longer practice FFing, we believe the scriptural principles behind the ministry remain sound. &lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 1994, after extensive research of Family publications and the testimony of many witnesses, The Lord Justice Ward said this about FFing:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted green;&quot;&gt;
I am quite satisfied that most of the women who engaged in this activity and the subsequent refinement of ESing, (which was finding men through escort agencies), did so in the belief that they were spreading God's word. But I am also totally satisfied that that was not Berg's only purpose. He and his organization had another and more sordid reason. They were procuring women to become common prostitutes. They were knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution. That was criminal activity. Their attempts to deny this must be dismissed as cant and hypocrisy. To deny that the girls were acting as prostitutes because &quot;we are not charging but we expect people to show their thanks and their appreciation and they ought to give more for love than if we charged them&quot; is an unacceptable form of special pleading. The &quot;FFers handbook&quot; told the girls that fishing could be fun but fun did not pay the bills. &quot;You've got to catch a few to make the fun pay for itself. So don't do it for nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A judge in Italy came to a very different conclusion in 1991, deciding that flirty fishing was not prostitution (see Tribunale Penale di Roma (Criminal Court of Rome), November 15, 1991, In re Berg and others, and in the archives of the Criminal Court of Rome (RG 3841/84):

The judges concluded that it was only in &quot;the last months of 1977 Berg started counseling the members that it was permissible for proselyting reasons to offer sexual contacts and services to perspective [sic] members, the more so when the latter were potentially good financial contributors to the cult.&quot;  Among the Children of God, the judges argued, flirty fishing was not understood as prostitution but &quot;as a personal contribution to the humanitarian aims that the sect always claimed to pursue.&quot;

The practice of [[Flirty Fishing]] or &quot;FFing&quot; was officially abandoned in 1987 in favor of other [[Evangelism|witnessing]] methods and also to avoid contracting [[AIDS]]. In 1987, new rules were introduced that banned, under penalty of [[excommunication]], sexual contact with non-members. However, the new rules also stated that exceptions to the rule would be allowed in certain cases. For example, one publication stated: &quot;All sex with outsiders is banned!--Unless they are already close and well-known friends!&quot; [http://www.exfamily.org/pubs/ml/b5/ml2531.shtml]

===The Family (1982-1994)===
By 1982 more Family members had moved to southern and eastern parts of the world and by the end of 1983 the Family was reporting 10,000 fulltime members living in 1,642 Family Homes. In addition the Music With Meaning radio club had by this time grown to almost 20,000 members. The Family also stated that at this time witnessing efforts were resulting in an average of 200,000 conversions to Christ and distribution of nearly 30 million pages of literature per month.

Berg's writings contributed to suspicions about the movement's care of their children, because of his challenging of modern-day taboos in Western society about adult/child sexuality. Some individuals do not believe that Berg merely questioned society's boundaries&amp;mdash;they believe he ignored them. Several women have publicly accused Berg of molesting them as children, including his eldest daughter [[Deborah Davis]], his granddaughter [[Merry Berg]], another of his granddaughters, [[Joyanne Treadwell Berg]], and [[Davida Kelley]], a child who had grown up in his household. 

A childcare manual published by the group in January of 1982 described the education, home life, and care of the son of [[Karen Zerby]], known as Davidito or [[Ricky Rodriguez]]. The 700-page book also included a dozen or so photographs depicting the child engaged in sexual play with his governesses, particularly Sara (also known as Sara Davidito, Sara Kelley, or Prisca Kelley). This book was removed from circulation and reprinted without the offending pages. Some pages from the original edition have been posted on the Internet Story Of Davidito [http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Story_of_Davidito]. Some claim that the publication of this book led to similar sexualization of children throughout the group.

By 1988, reports of sexual abuse began to filter up to the top of the Family's leadership. This prompted Berg to renounce his ideas regarding adult/child sex, writing: ''&quot;We do not approve of sex with minors, and hereby renounce any writings of anyone in our Family which may seem to do so! We absolutely forbid it! — Moses David 12/88&quot;'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Child Abuse?!&quot;&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Child_Abuse%3F%21 Child Abuse?!] (March 1989) (Hosted by [http://www.xFamily.org xfamily.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1989, the Family issued a statement which stated that, in &quot;early 1985&quot; an urgent memorandum was sent to all of its members ''&quot;reminding them that any such activities [adult-child sexual contact] are &lt;u&gt;strictly forbidden&lt;/u&gt; within our group.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Child Abuse?!&quot;/&gt; (emphasis in original). In January 2005, Claire Borowik, spokesperson for the Family International, issued a statement that said, &quot;Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not clearly stated in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense.[http://www.newdaynews.com/resource/davidito/borowick-01.htm]&quot;

In December 1988 the Family implemented a policy that forbade adult-child sexual contact on penalty of permanent excommunication (expulsion from the movement). This policy was not retroactive. The Family, as a religious movement, does not take the place of civil authorities when it comes to the investigation of alleged crimes. Individuals, or parents of minors, who have a complaint may take their case to the relevant authorities. Because of the impact such an investigation could have on the lives of other children living in the communal Home, members who file charges or pursue other legal action against those excommunicated for child abuse are expected to temporarily leave the Family or move to a different membership status, explained in the June 2003 Charter amendments&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter Amendments&quot;&gt;Charter Amendments, June 2003 ([http://www.xfamily.org/images/c/c5/CharterAmendments.pdf pdf]) (Hosted by [http://www.xFamily.org xfamily.org])&lt;/ref&gt; in the Rights of Children (pg. 22) and the Right of Redress (pg. 51) sections.

In the 1990s, allegations of sexual abuse were laid against The Family in different locations worldwide, including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States|USA]], and [[Venezuela]] (see links below). The Family leadership has maintained that they did not sanction or condone the sexual abuse of children, and that government-led investigations and court cases did not find evidence of abuse in the 750 children they examined. An outline of some court cases, selected excerpts of some court rulings, newspaper editorials and other material that supports the group's positions can be found at [http://www.cesnur.org/testi/TheFamily/se_thefamily.htm]. Some actual court documents can be found in the [[Children_of_God#Court_cases|Court Cases]] section below. 

The Family has issued apologies. Karen Zerby, writing in the Letter &quot;An Answer to Him That Asks&quot; in 1995 stated: &quot;Because of the insight Dad [Berg] gave into the Scriptures which granted us a great deal of sexual freedom, without clearly stated explicit restrictions that prohibited all sexual activity between adults and minors, it resulted in actions that caused harm to some children. He must therefore bear responsibility for the harm.  ... As the author of the Letters, he accepts the blame, but this doesn't mean that everyone else is completely blameless. Anyone who attempted to use the Law of Love to justify any unloving, selfish or hurtful behavior is responsible before God for it.&quot;

According to [[Eileen Barker]]'s book ''An Introduction to New Religious Movements'', the group has been acquitted of all charges of sexual abuse of children. Other researchers have concurred that there is no evidence of greater sexual activity amongst teenagers in the Family than in society at large. &lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy R. &quot;Correlates of Adolescent Sexual Activity in the Family&quot;, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family transformation in the 1990s====

In the early 1990s, alongside many other religious groups, Family members took advantage of the newly opened Eastern Europe (following the fall of communism) and expanded their evangelisation campaigns eastward. The production and dissemination of millions of pieces of Gospel literature earned them the colloquial name &quot;the poster people.&quot; 

The early 1990s also saw the launch of what the Family terms their &quot;Consider the Poor&quot; (CTP) ministries. Expanding their outreach beyond witnessing, members began reaching out a helping hand in material ways to the poor and disadvantaged. Family members became active in disaster relief efforts, the provision and distribution of humanitarian aid, musical benefit programs for refugees, visitation to hospitals, and so on.

===The Family (1995-2003)===
After Berg's death in October 1994, [[Karen Zerby]], known in the group as Mama, Queen Maria, Maria David or Maria Fontaine, took over leadership of the group. She then married her longtime coworker, [[Steven Douglas Kelly]], an American also known as Christopher Smith, Peter Amsterdam, or King Peter. He became her traveling representative due to Zerby's [[Recluse|reclusive]] separation from most of her followers.

In February of 1995, the group introduced the Family Charter [http://thefamily.org/dossier/charter/overview.htm], consisting of the &quot;Charter of Responsibilities and Rights,&quot; which defined the responsibilities which Charter Members, Homes and leadership were expected to live up to as the standard of discipleship and the rights of Charter members and of the Charter Home. Following that was the &quot;Fundamental Family Rules,&quot; which was a summary of all rules and guidelines from past Family publications which were still in effect with the enactment of the Charter.

The Charter set forth a new way of living within the organization--that of allowing members to operate according to their own faith and according to their desires. The rights referred to in the Charter were what a member could expect to receive from the group and how members were to be treated by leadership and fellow members. The responsibilities referred to were what members were expected to give to the group if they wished to remain full-time members, including [[tithe|tithing]] ten percent of their income to World Services, giving three percent to the &quot;Family Aid Fund,&quot; which was set up for the sole purpose of helping and supporting needy field situations worldwide, and one percent to the Home's regional common pot, which was used for local projects, activities, and fellowships.

The Charter also provided that it or any part of it could be revoked at any time by World Services if the need was to warranted it. The Charter, presently in its second edition, has been subsequently amended over the years according to the growing and changing needs of the movement.

In a 1995 court case, [[The Right Honourable|the Rt Hon.]] Lord Justice Ward decided that the group, including some among its top leadership, had engaged in abusive sexual practices involving minors and that they had also engaged in severe [[corporal punishment]] and sequestration of minor children. However, he concluded that the Family had abandoned these practices and that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg's writings that were &quot;responsible for children in the Family having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour.&quot;

The group has publicly renounced any doctrine that alluded to encouraging sex between adults and minors. This was made clear in an internal publication issued by Karen Zerby in 1988, where she stated, “We've already put out an urgent notice to the Family &amp; to the whole world that we don't do such things, and we mean it, we don't do it!--And anybody [in the Family] who does is in serious trouble, not only with the world but with us! … If we hear of anybody who violates these rules, we're going to immediately excommunicate them!” [Child Abuse—1988]

This renunciation was later argued by some, using what Family leader Karen Zerby said, as quoted from “Summit '93, Mama Jewels #2,” 1992 [http://www.geocities.com/magicgreenshirt/downloads/sj_pg19.gif], when she brought the subject of loving affection between adults and children up for discussion only at a leadership conference in 1992. Regardless, Family policy remained unchanged and offenders are excommunicated.

===The Family International (2004-present)===

In 2004 the movement's name was changed to the Family International. However Homes were told that they could retain their former names with the proviso that they make clear they are affiliated with the Family International.

In 2004 there were major internal changes in the group. Documents of the group talk about arresting a general trend to a less dedicated lifestyle and the need to be recommitted to the group's general mission of fervently preaching the Gospel. In the second half of 2004 they held a six-month renewal period to help members refocus their priorities. Membership was reorganized and new levels of membership were introduced. Members now fall into the following categories, Family Disciples, Missionary Members, Fellow Members, Active Members, and General Members.

The [[Family Discipleship Charter]], also known as the Family’s Charter, governs Family disciples, but the [[Missionary Member Statutes]] and the [[Fellow Member Statutes]] were written for the governance of the Family’s Missionary member and Fellow member circles, respectively. Homes of Family Disciples now work to newly annunciated set of criteria on which they are reviewed every six months.

At the beginning of 2005 there were 1,238 Family Homes and 10,202 members worldwide. Of those, 266 Homes and 4884 members were FD, 255 Homes and 1,769 members were MM, and 717 Homes and 3,549 members were FM. Statistics on AM and GM categories are currently unavailable.

===Issues===
====Child Abduction====
: ''Main article: [[Child Abduction in the Children of God]]''

Since the late 1970s, there have been increasing reports of children of former members being abducted and moved to other countries to prevent their parents, law enforcement authorities and child welfare agencies from finding them.  An investigation into the whereabouts of four missing children, whose mother, Ruth Frouman [http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Ruth_Frouman], was expelled from the group in July 1987, eight months after being diganosed with breast cancer, and not allowed to leave with her children, resulted in police raids [http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Legal_Case_Argentina%2C_1993] on 10 Family Homes in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 1993.[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Tribunal_de_Menores_de_Mercedes_-_Case_number_32.202]. Two of her children were returned to their father in May 1993. The other two abducted children were not reunited with their father and their other relatives until mid-1997. 

However, there have also been reports of parents taking their children out of the Family without the other parent's consent and instead resolving the custody dispute in the judicial system. For example, in 1992 the  spouse of Grant Borowick, brother of Family International spokesperson Susan Claire Borowik, left the Family and in 1993 returned with three male relatives to take her children back to her hometown of Salta, Argentina. According to news reports, Grant Borowick spent six months trying to obtain visitation rights through Argentine courts. [http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Hamilton_Spectator:_Cult_includes_brother_of_suspect_woman] It is unknown whether he was successful.

Although official Family spokespersons have rarely made any public statements about specific [[child abduction]] cases involving its members, members of the Family claim that there is some evidence that the Family's policies and practices regarding child abduction and child custody began to change in the mid-1990s. In February 1995, several months after the death of its founder, the Family introduced to its members a rule book known as the ''Love Charter'' or the ''Charter of Rights and Responsibilities''. Section 60, ''Permanent Marital Separation Rules'', states that couples with children must come to a mutual written agreement regarding the separation and the custody of the children and that obtaining a legal divorce and child custody order is optional.[http://www.xfamily.org/images/2/2d/Charter.pdf] This policy stated that it only applied to marital separations after February 1995. The June 2003 amendments state that if the parties involved cannot reach a mutual agreement and  &quot;opt to use the court system to settle the matter,&quot; they must &quot;relinquish Charter membership until the matter is settled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter Amendments&quot;/&gt;

At least one Family member, Peter Bevan Riddell, is known to have been convicted of child abduction. In 1984, he was convicted of child kidnapping and forgery in Japan and deported to Australia. After his release from prison, he returned to the Family to work for David Berg and Karen Zerby in World Services.[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Peter_Bevan_Riddell] Another Family member, Brian Edward Pickus, has been wanted for decades on an Interpol warrant issued by the United States and the state of Hawaii for kidnapping, burglary and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Brian_Edward_Pickus_-_Argentina_Extradition_Case]

====The second generation====
Second-generation adults, those adults who were born and/or raised in the Family International and are known in the movement as &quot;SGAs,&quot; have assumed many if not the majority of the leadership positions in the organization. This includes the chairmanships of many of the international, regional, and national boards.  

Yet as with other high-commitment religious groups, many second-generation members of the group have left to pursue secular careers, get a tertiary education, and raise their children in a drastically different environment than the one they were raised in. There is a great deal of anti-Family sentiment amongst some of those who have left, including threats to legally pursue alleged physical and sexual abusers, whom, some allege, have been shielded from prosecution by the group's leadership. 

The Family International has asserted that most former second-generation members have chosen to remain publicly silent about their experiences, and that the public silence of this group indicates that the vast majority of them have cordial relations with those still in it. It claims there is ample firsthand and [[anecdotal evidence]] to support this assertion. Many former second-generation members have publicly complained of negative experiences in the group.

As former [[Missionary Kids|missionary kids]], the second generation of former members have now become adults. Many have returned to the country of their citizenship and have, thus, become [[Third Culture Kids]] (TCKs). Many of the former second-generation members have kept in communication with each other. A notable example of this is their use of the site, MovingOn.org &lt;ref name=MovingOn&gt;[http://www.movingon.org/ MovingOn.org] - Community site for former second generation members of The Family&lt;/ref&gt; established by a former second-generation member in 2001. 

Those who have remained in the group have chosen to continue the missionary work of their parents and have been vocal in their defense of the Family lifestyle at MyConclusion.com&lt;ref name=MyConclusion&gt;[http://www.myconclusion.com MyConclusion.com] - Opinions and responses by current second-generation members with positive viewpoints about The Family&lt;/ref&gt;, a site established by second-generation members of the Family International shortly after the January 2005 murder-suicide of [http://www.rickyrodriguez.org Rick Rodriguez] and [http://www.angela-smith.org Angela Smith].
 
Members of the Family International are encouraged to maintain friendly relations with relatives who have left. However, they are also discouraged from associating with relatives that are considered active enemies of the Family. Some former second generation members have found it difficult to maintain friendly relations with their relatives still in the Family when their parents and siblings have appeared on televion programs around the world to denounce them as mentally unstable liars in the pay of the anti-cult movement. 

There are many former second generation members that have reported crimes to law enforcement agencies, have testified against the group in court cases involving its members, and publicly express negative opinions about the group's members and practices. The Family uses the sociological/religious term [[apostates]] to describe these ex-members and has argued that their testimony is unreliable and less credible than that of current members.  The Family has also argued that second generation members who alleged they were abused in the group are liars, mentally unstable or demon-possessed and that the anti-cult movement paid them large sums of money to tell lies about the Family. Some of the second generation of former members resent the apostate label, as most of them never chose to join this group in the first place (they were born into it) and, thus feel they cannot rightly be called apostates.

====Relationship with government authorities====
Family members are expected to respect the legal and civil authorities of the countries in which they live, in keeping with the biblical admonitions of Romans 13. Members may choose to use their adopted religious name in every day life, rather than their legal name.  

In sociological terms, the movement exists in high tension with the surrounding environment. Yet, members have consistently shown their peaceful cooperation with the duly appointed authorities, even when provoked by police and social service raids of their communities in the early 1990s. &lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims (2002). &quot;The Endtime Family: Children of God&quot;. ''State University of New York Press'', Albany, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secrecy====
A consistent trait throughout the history of The Family has been the high value they have placed on their independence and privacy from what they term the &quot;System&quot;—the surrounding political and economic environment. This has led to secrecy surrounding leadership and finances. World Services (WS), the central administrative wing of The Family, continues to operate in seclusion, with very few members of The Family actually knowing their whereabouts. 

Some members have legally changed their names. There have been allegations that members of the Family, including senior leaders, have used forged or fraudulently obtained passports and other identity documents from Australia, Canada, the United States and other countries.

Senior leadership also typically still attempt to keep their legal names from common circulation, although this has became more difficult through the second half of the 1990s, due to legal action in many countries. In particular, a major court case in England brought to light many formerly guarded names of senior members.

In The Family's publications printed photographs of WS members were typically &quot;censored&quot; by means of a rudimentary pencil drawing pasted over the person's face. It was not uncommon in Family-produced art for Berg's head to be replaced with that of a hand-drawn lion.

Following the death of David Berg in 1994, all members of The Family and the public were finally allowed to see up-to-date photographs of the organization's late founder. For many members this was the first time they had ever seen a photograph of his face. In recent years, Steven Kelly has carried pictures of Karen Zerby with him on travels to show members, since most have never seen a picture of their spiritual leader prior to this.

Although, by now, most of the group's members will have seen photographs or video footage of Karen Zerby and Steven Kelly, their identities and location are still heavily guarded by those members working closest to them. Recent photographs or video footage of Karen Zerby, Steven Kelly, and most WS members are not readily available even to fulltime members of The Family. Some may argue that it is unique that the organization's leadership neither seeks the limelight, nor lives at a higher standard than the rank and file, which is often not the case with other religious leaders and organizations.

====Finances====
Family finances are based on a system of [[tithe|tithing]]. Ten percent of all income for all members is required to be donated to World Services. A further three percent, typical in every region, is to be donated to the regional offices for locally administered projects and a community lending program. A further one percent is given for regional literature publishing.

A study of how The Family channels funds around the world is very interesting from a sociological angle since it depends largely on trust of carefully placed non-senior members who typically manage bank accounts in their own names that contain organization funds. Surprisingly, very little graft has been experienced, and the notable cases involved insubstantial amounts of money.

Organization literature includes many discussions of impending world financial doom. The Family as a result has gone to considerable lengths to avoid investments and actions that it deems unstable in the event of a world financial crash. Typically, they store any reserves in Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, or gold.

The Family has consistently avoided property investments and stocks or bonds, believing them to be contrary to the scriptural requirements for Christian discipleship and their [[End times|End time]] beliefs.

==Criticism==
The group has often and heavily been criticized by the press and the [[anti-cult movement]]. In 1971, an organization called [[FREECOG]] was founded by concerned family members of followers, including [[deprogramming|deprogrammer]] [[Ted Patrick]], to &quot;free&quot; them from their involvement in the group.

Frequently, critics of the movement cite the writings of David Berg and/or specific incidents and behavior of certain individuals, including members of the leadership. Family members meanwhile argue that the entire volume of writings of Father David do not reflect either the fundamental beliefs (contained in the &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;) or the organization's policies (contained in the Charter, published in 1995). Likewise, they reject the concept of the entire group being blamed for the alleged wrongdoing of individuals. 

The controversy over the movement has generated strong feelings in both current and ex-members. An example of the contrasting interpretations of Family life can be seen in the accounts of second generation members: former members at [http://www.movingon.org/abuse.asp Movingon.Org] and (mostly) current members at MyConclusion.com&lt;ref name=&quot;MyConclusion&quot;/&gt;.

==Notable members (past and present) ==
Actors [[River Phoenix]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Summer Phoenix]], [[Rain Phoenix]], and [[Rose McGowan]] were members of the group during their childhood. Renowned [http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/rrhof.htm] [[blues]] [[slide guitar|slide guitarist]] [[Jeremy Spencer]] [http://jeremyspencer.com/], a founding member of [[Fleetwood Mac]], has been a member of the group since 1971. Comedian [[Tina Dupuy]] [http://www.tinadupuy.com] was also a member, and now mentions her childhood in the group in her act.

==Statistics==

According to the Children of God, there were 130 [[Intentional Community|communes]] or &quot;colonies&quot; in 15 countries in 1972. In 1993, 7,000 of the 10,000 members were under 18 years of age.  Recent statistics by The Family International puts full-time and fellow members at just over 11,200 in over 100 countries (around 4,000 adult full-time members and 4,000 children). Some estimates have placed the total number of people that have passed through the group at 35,000.

==Programs, projects, and productions==
:''Main article: [[Programs, projects, and productions of the Children of God]].''

The Family International (as the group calls itself today) or The Family International Fellowship has various programs through which it operates. The main ones include ''Family Care Foundation'' (FCF), ''Aurora Productions AG'', and [[Activated Ministries]]. However, the group has many other local foundations and projects in various countries throughout the world.

==Leadership, Regional Offices, and Management==
:''Main article: [[Leadership and Management of the Children Of God]].''
The leadership of The Family International is headed by:
* Karen Elva Zerby
: - spiritual leader of The Family International
: - American
: - legally changed her name ''to'' Katherine Rianna Smith, 4-Nov-1997
: - Aliases: Maria, Mama, Maria Fontaine, Maria David, Maria Berg, or Queen Maria
* Steven Douglas Kelly
: - head-leader of The Family International
: - American
: - legally changed his name ''to'' Chris Smith
: - Aliases: Peter Amsterdam or King Peter

Under them, management is divided into ''World Services'', ''Creations'', and ''Family Care Foundation''. 
Each region is managed by a team of Continental Officers (COs), each team typically having five to seven members. The management structures beneath the CO team are more variable and their members are changed frequently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CodexOfHammurabi.jpg|thumb|An inscription of the Code of Hammurabi]]
[[Image:Code-de-Hammurabi-2.jpg|thumb|]]
[[Image:Code-de-Hammurabi-1.jpg|thumb|]]
The '''Code of Hammurabi''' (also known as the '''Codex Hammurabi''' and '''Hammurabi's Code'''), created ca. [[1780 BC]] ([[short chronology]]), is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. Other collections of laws include the codex of  [[Ur-Nammu]], king of [[Ur]] (ca. [[2050 BC]]), the Codex of [[Eshnunna]] (ca. [[1930 BC]]) and the codex of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] (ca. [[1870 BC]]).

It shows rules and punishments if those rules are broken. It focuses on [[theft]], [[agriculture]] (or shepherding), [[property damage]], [[Legal rights of women in history|women's rights]], [[marriage]]  rights, [[children's rights]], [[slavery|slave rights]], [[murder]], [[death]], and [[injury]]. The punishment varies depending on the  class of offenders and victims. For a comprehensive summary, see [[Babylonian law]].

The laws do not accept excuses or explanations for mistakes or fault: the Code was openly displayed for all to see, so no man could plead ignorance of the law as an excuse. Few people, however, could read in that era (literacy mainly being the domain of scribes).  

[[Hammurabi]] ([[1728 BC]]-[[1686 BC]]) felt he had to write the code to please his [[God|gods]]. Unlike many earlier and contemporary kings, he did not consider himself related to any god, although he did call himself &quot;the favorite of the gods.&quot; In the upper part of the [[stela]], Hammurabi is shown in front of the throne of the sun god [[Shamash]].

The laws (numbered from 1 to 282, but numbers 13, and 66-99 are missing) are inscribed in [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] on an eight foot tall stela of black [[diorite]]. It was discovered in [[December]] [[1901]] in [[Susa]], [[Elam]], which is now [[Khuzestan]], [[Iran]], where it had been taken as plunder by the Elamites in the [[12th century BC]]. It is currently on display at the [[Louvre]] Museum in [[Paris]], [[France]].

The code is often pointed to as the first example of the legal concept that some [[law]]s are so basic as to be beyond the ability of even a [[monarch|king]] to change. By writing the laws on stone they were immutable. This concept lives on in most modern legal systems and has given rise to the term ''written in stone''.

The Code of Hammurabi was one of many sets of laws in the [[Ancient Near East]]. Most of these law codes, coming from similar cultures and racial groups in a relatively small geographical area, necessarily have passages that resemble each other. For example, the laws found in the later [[Hittite]] code of laws (ca. [[1300 BC]]) have some individual laws that bear a passing resemblance to those in the Code of Hammurabi, as well as other codices from the same geographic area. The earlier Ur-Nammu, of the written literature prolific [[Ur-III]] dynasty ([[21st century BC]]), also produced a code of laws, some of which bear resemblance to certain specific laws in the Code of Hammurabi. The later [[Mosaic Law]] (according to the modern [[documentary hypothesis]] ca. [[700 BC|700]-[[500 BC]] - under [[Hezekiah]]/[[Josiah]]; traditionally ca. [[1200 BC]] - under [[Moses]]) also has some laws that resemble the Code of Hammurabi, as well as other law codes of the region.

The '''Cuba Libre''' (KOO-buh-LEE-breh) is a [[cocktail]] made of

* 3 [[ounce]]s [[Cola]]
* [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] wedge
* 1 ounce [[rum]]

Rub the rim of a highball glass with the lime. Fill with ice. 
Add rum and fill with Cola. Drop in the lime squeeze. 

{{Wikibookspar|Bartending|Cuba Libre}}

The Cuba Libre ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''Free [[Cuba]]'') was invented in [[Havana, Cuba]] around [[1900]]. 
Patriots aiding Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]]&amp;mdash;and, later, expatriates avoiding [[Prohibition]]&amp;mdash;regularly mixed rum and Cola as a cocktail and a toast to this West Indies island.

According to [[Bacardi]]: 
:&quot;The world's most popular drink was born in a collision between the United States and [[Spain]]. It happened during the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century when [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]], the [[Rough Riders]], and [[United States|Americans]] in large numbers arrived in Cuba. One afternoon, a group of off-duty soldiers from the U.S. Signal Corps were gathered in a bar in Old Havana. Fausto Rodriguez, a young messenger, later recalled that a captain came in and ordered Bacardi rum and Coca-Cola on ice with a wedge of lime. The captain drank the concoction with such pleasure that it sparked the interest of the soldiers around him. They had the bartender prepare a round of the captain's drink for them. The Bacardi rum and Coke was an instant hit. As it does to this day, the drink united the crowd in a spirit of fun and good fellowship. When they ordered another round, one soldier suggested that they toast ''¡Por Cuba Libre!'' in celebration of the newly freed Cuba. The captain raised his glass and sang out the battle cry that had inspired Cuba's victorious soldiers in the War of Independence.&quot; [http://www.bacardi.com] 

According to a [[1965]] deposition by [[Fausto Rodriguez]], the Cuba Libre was first mixed at a Cuban bar in August of [[1900]] by a member of the U.S. Signal Corps, referred to as &quot;[[John Doe]].&quot;

Soon enough, as Charles H. Baker points out in his ''Gentlemen's Companion'' of [[1934]], the Cuba Libre &quot;caught on everywhere throughout [[U.S. Southern States|the South]] [of the US, ed] ... filtered through the North and West,&quot; aided by the ample supply of its ingredients. In ''The American Language'', [[H.L. Mencken]] writes of an early variation of the drink: &quot;The troglodytes of western [[South Carolina]] coined 'jump stiddy' for a mixture of Coca-Cola and [[denatured alcohol]] (usually drawn from automobile radiators); connoisseurs reputedly preferred the taste of what had been aged in [[Model-T|Model-T Fords]].&quot;

The Cuba Libre gained further popularity in the U.S. after [[the Andrews Sisters]] recorded a song (in 1945) named after the drink's ingredients, &quot;[[Rum and Coca-Cola]].&quot; 
Cola and rum were both cheap at the time and this also contributed to the widespread popularity of the concoction.

This drink was once viewed as exotic, with its dark syrup made, at that time, from [[cola nuts]] and [[coca]].

== Variations ==
The &quot;Cuba Pintada&quot; (stained cuba), and &quot;Cuba Campechana&quot; are also popular, specially among young people. The first one is rum with club soda and just a little bit of cola product(just enough that it stains the glass), the Campechana contains half club soda and half coke.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[collagen]], the '''collagen helix''' is a major shape in [[quaternery structure]]. It consists of a triple [[helix]] made of the repetitious [[amino acid]] sequence [[glycine]] - [[proline]] - [[hydroxyproline]].
Each of the three chains is stabilized by the [[steric repulsion]] due to the [[pyrrolidone]] rings of [[proline]] and [[hydroxyproline]] [[residue]]s. The pyrrolidone rings keep out of each other’s way when the [[polypeptide]] chain assumes this extended [[helical]] form, which is much more open than the tightly coiled form of the [[alpha helix]].
The three chains are [[hydrogen bonded]] to each other. The [[hydrogen bond donors]] are the [[peptide]] NH groups of [[glycine]] residues. The [[hydrogen bond acceptors]] are the CO groups of residues on the other chains. The OH group of [[hydroxyproline]] also participates in hydrogen bonding. The rise of the collagen helix (superhelix) is 290 picometres (0.29 nm) per residue.

In [[general relativity]], the '''cosmic censorship hypothesis (CCH)''' is a conjecture about the nature of [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] in [[spacetime]].

Singularities that arise in the solutions of [[Einstein's field equation|Einstein's equations]] are typically hidden within [[event horizon]]s, and therefore cannot be seen from the rest of spacetime. Singularities which are not so hidden are called ''[[naked singularity|naked]]''.   
The '''weak cosmic censorship hypothesis''' conjectures that no naked singularities other than the [[Big Bang]] singularity exist in the universe.

==Basics==
The fundamental concern is that since the physical behavior of singularities is unknown, if singularities can be seen from the rest of spacetime, [[causality]] may break down, and [[physics]] may lose its predictive power. The issue cannot be avoided, since according to the [[Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]], singularities are inevitable in physically reasonable situations. Still, in the absence of naked singularities, the universe is deterministic &amp;mdash; it's possible to predict the entire evolution of the universe, knowing only its condition at a certain moment of time (more precisely, everywhere on a [[spacelike]] 3-dimensional hypersurface, called the [[Cauchy surface]]). Failure of the cosmic censorship hypothesis leads to the failure of determinism, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of space-time in the causal future of a naked singularity.

The hypothesis was first formulated by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969, and it is not stated in a completely formal way. In a sense it is more of a research program proposal: part of the research is to find a proper formal statement that is physically reasonable and that can be proved to be true or false (and that is sufficiently general to be interesting).

==Problems with the concept==
There are a number of difficulties in formalizing the hypothesis:

* there are technical difficulties with properly formalizing the notion of a singularity.
* it is not difficult to construct spacetimes which have naked singularities, but which are not &quot;physically reasonable&quot;. A formal statement needs some set of hypotheses which exclude these situations.
* It could happen that an observer inside the event horizon could see the singularity. The version of the conjecture which excludes this case is the ''strong cosmic censorship hypothesis''.
* [[Caustic]]s may occur in simple models of gravitational collapse, and can appear to lead to singularities. These have more to do with the simplified models of bulk matter used, and in any case have nothing to do with general relativity, and need to be excluded.
* Computer models of gravitational collapse have shown that naked singularities can arise, but these models rely on very special circumstances (such as spherical symmetry). These special circumstances need to be excluded by some hypothesis.

In 1991, [[John Preskill]]  and [[Kip Thorne]] bet against [[Stephen Hawking]] that the hypothesis was false.  They won the bet (for a T-shirt to cover the winner's nakedness) due to the discovery of the special situations just mentioned.  Hawking later reformulated the bet to exclude those technicalities.  The revised bet is still open.

== The strong cosmic censorship hypothesis ==

While the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts that any observer who has observed a singularity is destined to fall into it, it does not give a timeframe for this to happen. As such, for classical general relativity to be a complete theory, an observer of a naked singularity should still have a theory to explain what is observed; Penrose thus formulated a stronger version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis (known as the '''strong cosmic censorship hypothesis''') that asserts that no singularity is ever visible to any observer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Catholic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]) {{Polytonic|καθολικός}}, universal, from {{Polytonic|καθόλου}}, in general: {{Polytonic|κατα-}}, according to + {{Polytonic|ὅλου}}, neuter genitive of {{Polytonic|ὅλος}}, whole) can be used as a specifically [[Christian]] religious term with a number of meanings: 

* In one widely used sense, it refers to the members, beliefs, and practices of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], particularly in countries and languages associated with the Protestant Reformation, where the attachment &quot;Roman&quot; was once used by early Protestants to disparage Catholic claims to be the sole historical Christian Church. Though many identify Roman Catholicism exclusively with the [[Latin Rite|Latin or Western]] Church, its variety is seen in the more than twenty other [[particular Church]]es, the &quot;[[Eastern Rite|Eastern Catholic Churches]]&quot;, all in full [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with the [[Pope]]. Major Eastern Catholic churches in communion with the Pope include the Ukrainian, Greek, Greek Melkite, Maronite, Ruthenian Byzantine, Coptic Catholic, Syro-Malabar, Syro-Malankara, Chaldean, and Ethiopian Catholic Churches.
* Some Protestant Christians use the term ''catholic'' (lower-case ''c'') to refer to the belief that all [[Christianity|Christians]] are part of one Church, regardless of denominational divisions. This &quot;universal&quot; interpretation is often used to understand the phrase &quot;[[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church|one holy catholic and apostolic Church]]&quot; in the [[Nicene Creed]], the phrase &quot;the catholic faith&quot; in the [[Athanasian Creed]], and the phrase &quot;holy catholic church&quot; in the [[Apostles' Creed]].
* It can be used to refer to those Christian Churches which maintain that their [[episcopal|Episcopate]] can be traced directly back to the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]]s, and that they are therefore part of a broad catholic (or universal) body of believers. Among those who regard themselves as ''Catholic'' but not ''Roman Catholic'' are members of the various [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es (such as the [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Russian Orthodox]]), the [[Oriental Orthodox]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Anglican]]s, and some very small groups such as the [[Old Catholic Church]], the [[Independent Catholic]], the [[Ancient Catholic|Ancient]] and [[Liberal Catholic Church]]es, as well as the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] (though the latter prefer the lower-case &quot;c,&quot; and, like Anglicans, stress that they are both Protestant ''and'' Catholic). These various churches that regard themselves as part of a broad Catholic Church are distinguished primarily by their use of the [[Nicene Creed]], in which believers acknowledge the &quot;[[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church|one holy catholic and apostolic Church]].&quot; The Nicene Creed is of course also used by the Roman Catholic Church.
* It can mean the one Church founded by Christ through [[Apostle Peter|Peter the Apostle]], according to Matthew 16:18-19: &quot;And I tell you, you are ''Cephas'' (which means rock), and on this rock I will build my Church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.’&quot; In Roman Catholic theology, this is understood to mean specifically the Roman Catholic Church.
*Some use the term ''Catholic'' to distinguish their own position from a [[Calvinist]] or [[Puritan]] form of Reformed-[[Protestantism]]. These include [[High Church]] [[Anglican]]s, known also as &quot;[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]],&quot; High Church [[Lutheran]]s, known also as [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutherans]], and others.

[[Methodist]]s  and [[Presbyterian]]s believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early Church, but do not claim descent from ancient Church structures such as the episcopate. Neither of these Churches, however, denies that they are a part of the catholic (meaning universal) Church. 

== History of usage ==
Early [[Christianity|Christians]], such as Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (who was martyred in about [[110]]), used the term to describe the whole [[Church]] - the word's literal meaning is ''universal'' or ''whole'' - as opposed to the local Church, and excluding  adherents of [[sects]] or [[heresy|heretical]] groups.

A letter that Saint Ignatius wrote to Christians in Smyrna in about 107 is the earliest surviving witness to the use of the term &quot;catholic Church&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 8).[1] By it Saint Ignatius designated the Christian Church in its universal aspect, excluding heretics, such as those who disavow &quot;the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 7).[2] He called such people &quot;beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 4).[3]

The use of the term &quot;Catholic&quot; to distinguish the &quot;true&quot; Church from heretical groups is found also in [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], who wrote:
:&quot;In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the [[Apostle Peter]], to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15-19), down to the present episcopate.
:&quot;And so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.
:&quot;Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&quot; 
: &amp;mdash; St. Augustine (354&amp;ndash;430): ''Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental'', chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith[http://www.ccel.org/pager.cgi?&amp;file=fathers/NPNF1-04/augustine/bk_fundamental/bk1.html&amp;from=CHAP4&amp;up=]

Earlier still, [[Cyril of Jerusalem|St Cyril of Jerusalem]] (circa 315-386) urged those he was instructing in the Christian faith: &quot;If ever thou art sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God&quot; (Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310118.htm]

A contemporary of Augustine, [[St. Vincent of Lerins]], wrote in 434 under the pseudonym Peregrinus a work known as the ''Commonitoria'' (&quot;Memoranda&quot;). While insisting that, like the human body, Church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII), he stated: &quot;[I]n the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in the strictest sense 'Catholic,' which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors&quot; (section 6, end of chapter II).

==Present-day usage==
While other Christian denominations also lay claim to the description &quot;catholic&quot;, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches possessing the [[historic episcopate]] (bishops), the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot; is usually associated with the Church that is also called the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and whose over one billion adherents are about half of the estimated 2.1 billion Christians. 

In countries that have been traditionally Protestant, ''Catholic'' will often be included in the official name of a particular [[parish]] church, school, [[hospice]] or other institution belonging to the Roman Catholic Church, to distinguish it from those of other [[Christianity:_Denominations|denominations]]. For example, the name &quot;St. Mark's ''Catholic'' Church&quot; seeks to make clear that it is not an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] or [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church.

Those who apply the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot; to all Christians indiscriminately find it objectionable that a term that they see as designating the ''whole'' Church as an invisible entity should be used to refer to one communion only. However, the Roman Catholic Church, which holds that there can be no such thing as the Church as an &quot;invisible entity&quot; &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt;, or grouping of separated Communions, normally refers to itself simply as the Catholic Church, as shown in its publication of a &quot;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]&quot;.  It claims that it can basically be traced historically to the original Catholic or universal Church, from which various groups broke away over the centuries.  The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] all make the same claim in their own favour

Though normally referring to itself simply as the Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church accepts the latter description in its relations with other Churches. There are some instances of its application to itself, in internal documents, of the adjective &quot;Roman&quot;, to indicate the central position for it of the see of Rome. An example is its self-description as the &quot;Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church&quot;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/V1.HTM#4] in the [[24 April]] [[1870]] Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith of the [[First Vatican Council]], a document in which it also refers to itself five times as simply the Catholic Church. This practice of calling itself simply the Catholic Church is in application of the belief that those who break off cease to be part of the Catholic Church - a belief that goes back, as mentioned above, even to Saint Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term ''Catholic Church'' - combined with the belief that all who are not in full [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with the [[Pope|See of Rome]] have &quot;broken off.&quot;

== Divergent usages ==
As noted, in addition to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Oriental Orthodox|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] all see themselves as the &quot;[[one holy catholic and apostolic Church]]&quot; of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Old Catholic Church|Old-Catholics]] each see themselves as a Communion within that one Church, and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] see themselves as &quot;a reform movement within the greater Church catholic.&quot; The Orthodox do not recognize the universal primacy of the Bishop of Rome (i.e., the [[Pope]]), but do rank him as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (&quot;first among equals&quot;) among the five major ancient Christian Patriarchates (super-metropolitical archiepiscopal Sees) of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome.  Anglicans and Old-Catholics accept that the Bishop of Rome is ''primus inter pares'' among all [[primates]], but they embrace [[Conciliarism]] as a necessary check on what they consider to be the &quot;excesses&quot; of Roman [[Ultramontanism]].  The Catholic Church's view of the Bishop of Rome is that he is not only ''primus inter pares,'' but that he is also given a special charism as the &quot;Successor of Peter&quot; to serve as universal pastor to the entire Church. The Catholic Church summarizes this view with the ancient quote, &quot;Where Peter is, there is the Church.&quot;  

Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians (in general), and the Assyrian Church of the East each recognize the &quot;validity&quot; of each other's [[Eucharist]] ([[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]]), and of the holy orders of their respective priesthoods and episcopate. The Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, considers Anglican Holy Orders to be &quot;null and void,&quot; as declared by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his Bull ''[[Apostolicae curae]]''. Beginning with the Encyclical Letter ''[[Saepius officio]]'' of the [[Archbishop]]s of [[Canterbury]] and [[York]] in response to ''Apostolicae curae'', Anglicans, for obvious reasons, have steadfastly rejected this claim.  At present, Old-Catholics and many Lutheran churches are in [[full communion]] with the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], including full exchange of clergy and participation in each other's ordinations (including episcopal consecrations).  Although there were several statements made by a couple of Orthodox leaders in the early 20th century giving hope to High Anglican clergy that their priestly orders would eventually be recognized as valid by the Orthodox, today there is little variance among Orthodox patriarchs and metropolitans on the validity of Anglican Orders.  As with the Catholic Church, today the Orthodox churches universally require ordination to the priesthood for Anglican clergy that convert to Orthodoxy, evidencing the prevailing Orthodox view that the Anglican liturgy is non-sacramental in nature.  Recent decisions by various Anglican/Episcopal bishops to ordain women to the priesthood and to the episcopate have rendered any hope of formal ecclesiastical union with Orthodoxy (from the Orthodox point of view) a moot point.   

Thus, for example, in an emergency, when no Roman Catholic priest is available, a Roman Catholic may, under canon law, receive the &quot;Holy Eucharist&quot; and receive absolution from an Orthodox priest, but not from an Anglican priest. This also means that if an Episcopal or Anglican (male) priest converts to the Roman Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church confers ordination on him (in its view, for the first time) and excludes women from Holy Orders. This divergence of belief is a considerable block to greater unity, in spite of substantial progress in ecumenical dialogues between Anglicans and Roman Catholics since the [[Second Vatican Council]].

Recent historic ecumenical efforts on the part of Roman Catholic Church have focused on healing the rupture between the Western (the Roman or Latin) Christian Church and the Eastern Christian Church (the &quot;Greek&quot; or &quot;Orthodox&quot;). Before he was incapacitated with a degenerative illness, [[Pope John Paul II]] often spoke of his great desire that the Catholic Church &quot;once again breathe with both lungs,&quot; thus emphasizing that the Catholic Church seeks to restore full communion with the separated &quot;Byzantine&quot; and &quot;Oriental&quot; Christian Churches of the ancient East.

After the first rupture in the Catholic Church in 1054 between East and West, a brief reunification took place in the mid-15th century at the Council of Florence. The present Pope (Benedict XVI) has stated his intentions in restoring full unity with the Orthodox. From the Catholic standpoint, almost all of the ancient theological differences have been satisfactorily addressed (the Filioque clause, the nature of purgatory, etc.), and the experience of the Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with Rome has shown that the eventual reunion will not mean a &quot;Latinization&quot; of the Eastern Churches.

==Capitalization==
Capitalization is no sure guide to denominational affiliation. It may indicate formal affiliation with the (Roman) Catholic Church or it may not. Capitalization may merely indicate a wish to stress the [[holy]] and solemn nature of the [[spirituality|spiritual]] body of believers and a desire for all Christians to be one.

It would be anachronistic to attribute significance to capitalization or lack of capitalization in printings of texts dating from before the last few centuries or in translations of those texts, since the originals were written in unmixed majuscule or minuscule letters. Translations even of modern texts into English often follow the usage of the original language. For instance, since French normally capitalizes only the first word of the title of an entity, the adjective &quot;catholique&quot;, following the noun &quot;Église&quot;, has a lower-case initial. Texts in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] generally follow this usage, not the English practice.

==Avoidance of usage==
Some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches avoid using the term completely. The Orthodox Churches share some of the concerns about Roman Catholic papal claims, but disagree with some Protestants about the nature of the Church as one body. For some, to use the word &quot;Catholic&quot; at all is to appear to give credence to papal claims.

'''Crystal Eastman''' ([[June 25]], [[1881]] - [[July 8]], [[1928]]) was a [[lawyer]], [[antimilitarism|antimilitarist]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[socialism|socialist]], and journalist. She graduated from [[Vassar College]] in [[1903]], receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in [[sociology]] from [[Columbia University]] in [[1904]]. She was second in the class of [[1907]] at [[New York University Law School]].

==Social efforts==
Social work pioneer and journal editor [[Paul Kellogg]] offered Eastman her first job, investigating labor conditions for [[The Pittsburgh Survey]] sponsored by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]]. Her report, ''Work Accidents and the Law'' ([[1910]]), became a classic and resulted in the first [[workers' compensation]] law, which she drafted while serving on a New York State commission. She continued to campaign for occupational safety and health while working as an investigating attorney for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency.

==Emancipation==
During a brief marriage, Eastman lived in [[Milwaukee]] and managed the unsuccessful [[1912]] [[Wisconsin]] [[suffrage]] battle. When she returned east in [[1913]] she joined [[Alice Paul]], [[Lucy Burns]], and others in founding the militant [[Congressional Union]], which became the [[National Woman's Party]]. After women won the vote, Eastman and three others wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] introduced in [[1923]]. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, she warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it, but she felt that &quot;''this is a fight worth fighting even if it takes ten years.''&quot;

==Peace efforts==
During [[World War I]], Eastman founded the [[Woman's Peace party]] and was president of the [[New York City|New York]] branch. Renamed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in [[1921]], it remains the oldest extant women's peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the [[American Union against Militarism]], which lobbied against America's entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in [[1916]], sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing, and campaigned against [[conscription]] and imperial adventures. When the United States entered World War I, Eastman organized the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] to protect [[conscientious objectors]], or in her words: ''To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over.'' Though never appropriately credited as a founder of the organization, which became the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], she was the attorney in charge.

Eastman had married British poet and antiwar activist [[Walter Fuller]] in [[1916]] with whom she had two children, and worked with him until the end of the war, when he returned to [[England]] to find work.

==Post-War==
After the war, Eastman organized the [[First Feminist Congress]] in [[1919]], she co-owned and edited a radical journal of politics, art, and literature, ''[[The Liberator]]'', with her brother [[Max Eastman|Max]] and she [[commuting|commuted]] between [[London]], to be with her husband, and New York, where she was blacklisted and thus rendered unemployable during the [[Red Scare]] of 1919-1921. During the [[1920s]] her only paid work was as a columnist for feminist journals, notably ''[[Equal Rights]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide]]''. Eastman claimed that &quot;''life was a big battle for the complete feminist,''&quot; but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.

Eastman has been called one of the United States' most neglected leaders, because, although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for fifty years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A professor-emeritus (the [[University of California, Berkeley]]) and licensed contractor as well as architect, '''Christopher Alexander''' (born [[October 4]], [[1936]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) is noted for his design of building complexes in [[California]], [[Japan]], and [[Mexico]]. However, he may be famous mostly for his popular appeal and his theoretical contributions.  With [[Sarah Ishikawa]] and [[Murray Silverstein]], he produced and validated an architectural system, a [[pattern language]] designed to empower any human being to design and build quite well at any scale.  He began the project because he believes that users know more about the buildings they need than any architect could.  Based in [[England]], he continues to practice architecture and consult in planning.

==Life==
Alexander grew up in England. His education started in sciences. He was awarded the top open scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1954, in chemistry and physics and went on to read mathematics. He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Architecture and a [[Master's degree]] in Mathematics. He took his doctorate in Harvard (the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Architecture ever awarded at [[Harvard University]]), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked at MIT in transportation theory and in computer science, and worked at Harvard in cognition and cognitive studies. He became professor of Architecture at Berkeley in [[1963]], taught there continuously for 38 years, and is now Professor Emeritus at the University of California. He is widely recognized as the father of the pattern language movement in computer science. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996 for his contributions to architecture.

==Work==
===Writings===
''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:

:''&quot;There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way. And, as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.&quot;''

''[[A Pattern Language]]: Towns, Buildings, Construction'' described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a [[generative grammar]].  

The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious.  The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.  

The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project.  It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.  

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.  

The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily-stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor.  It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials.  Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete.  It uses [[vault]]ed construction to build as high as three stories, permitting very high densities. 

This book's method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in ''The [[Oregon Experiment]]'', and remains the official planning instrument.  It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.

[[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]] is his latest and major work. It consists of four volumes. In it, he puts forward a new theory about the nature of the space around us and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, and so forth.

The mostly static patterns from ''A Pattern Language'' have been amended by [[sequence theory|more dynamic sequences]], which describe how to work towards patterns (which can roughly be seen as the end result of sequences). [[sequence theory|Sequences]], like [[pattern language|patterns]], promise to be tools of wider scope than building (just as his theory of space goes beyond architecture).

His other books are:

* ''The Production of Houses''
* ''A New Theory of Urban Design''
* ''A Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art, The Geometry of Very Early Turkish Carpets''
* ''The Mary Rose Museum''
* ''Notes on the Synthesis of Form''
* ''The Linz Cafe''

Published in 2002-2003
* ''The Nature of Order'' I - IV

===Buildings===
Among Alexander's most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near Tokyo; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in [[San Jose, California]] (both described in ''Nature of Order''); the Martinez House (an experimental house in [[Martinez, California]] made of lightweight concrete); and the low-cost housing in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]] (described in ''The Production of Houses'').

==Influence==
===Computer Science===

Alexander's [[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]] was required reading, for researchers in computer science, throughout the 1960's. [[Marvin Minsky]], Founder of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, recommended it to students &amp; colleagues. It had an aesthetic influence in the 1960's &amp; 1970's on [[programming language design]], [[modular programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[software engineering]] and other design methodologies. Alexander's mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s influential [[A Discipline of Programming]]. 

''[[A Pattern Language]]''‘s best known conceptual effect is the [[design patterns]] movement. Alexander's philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design influenced also the [[Extreme programming]] movement.

[[Will Wright]] wrote that Alexander's work was influential in the origin of [[The Sims]] computer game, and in his current new work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Clabbers example board.png|thumb|An example board from a game of Clabbers]]

'''Clabbers''' is a game played by tournament [[Scrabble]] players for fun, or occasionally at Scrabble variant tournaments.  The name derives from the fact that the words CLABBERS and SCRABBLE form an [[anagram]] pair.

Its rules are identical to that of Scrabble, except that valid plays are only required to form anagrams of acceptable words; in other words, the letters in a word do not need to be placed in the correct order. If a word is challenged, the player who played the word must then name an acceptable word that anagrams to the tiles played.

For example, in the board shown, the word BEERY has been played as EBRYE so as to place the Y on the [[double letter score]].

Because the number of &quot;words&quot; that can be formed is vastly larger than in [[standard English]], the board usually ends up tightly packed in places, and necessarily quite empty in others.

'''Chaos''' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Χάος and typically refers to [[unpredictability]]. In the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, it is the opposite of [[law]] and [[order]]: unrestrictive, both creative and destructive.

The word χάος did not mean &quot;disorder&quot; in classical-period [[ancient Greece]]. It meant &quot;the primal emptiness, [[outer space|space]]&quot;. It is derived from the [[Indo-European]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''ghn'' or ''ghen'' meaning &quot;gape, be wide open&quot;: compare &quot;chasm&quot; (from [[Greek language|Greek]]), and [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''gānian'' (= &quot;yawn&quot;), ''geanian, ginian'' (= &quot;gape wide&quot;); see also [[Old Norse]] [[Ginnungagap|Ginnunga Gap]]. Due to people misunderstanding early Christian uses of the word, the meaning of the word changed to &quot;disorder&quot;. (''The Ancient Greek for &quot;disorder&quot; is ταραχη.'').

Mathematically chaos means an aperiodic deterministic behavior which is very sensitive to its initial conditions see [[chaos theory]].

An oft-made assumption is that the metaphysical chaos is [[evil]] and that law is [[goodness and value theory|good]]; however it should be noted these are different concepts, and it is quite possible for chaos to be good and law to be evil. One example of this would be the story of [[Robin Hood]], or the examples of oppressive governments and dictatorships being thrown off by [[freedom fighters]] such as [[Nelson Mandela]]. Chaos and order are often attributed with moral perceptions, however moral perception is order, and thus the notion of applying such a thing to chaos is quite absurd.

Chaos is also used in the [[Bible]] to refer to the earliest conditions of the universe, the unbounded space and formless matter that existed before the creation of the universe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about [[Michael Moorcock]]'s fantasy hero; for other meanings, see [[Corum (disambiguation)]].''


'''Corum Jhaelen Irsei''' is the name of a fantasy hero in a series of books written by [[Michael Moorcock]].  Corum is an aspect of Moorcock's [[Eternal Champion]] and is, therefore, related to some of his other characters, such as [[Elric of Melniboné]] and [[Hawkmoon]].  His books also draw heavily on ancient Celtic mythology, especially the second trilogy.  Corum himself is the last of an ancient race called the Vadhagh, who are slaughtered by the new race of Mabden (humans).  He was a prince of his people - Corum Jhaelen Irsei, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe.

Corum is the protagonist of the following Moorcock novels:

* ''The Knight of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The Queen of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The King of the Swords'' (1971)
* ''The Bull and the Spear'' (1973)
* ''The Oak and the Ram'' (1973)
* ''The Sword and the Stallion'' (1974)

The first three have been published in the UK under the omnibus title ''Corum'', and the second three under the omnibus title ''The Prince with the Silver Hand''.  In the US, the omnibus titles are ''The Swords Trilogy'' and ''The Chronicles of Corum'', respectively.

In 2001 [[Darcsyde Productions]] produced a supplement for use with [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' (aka ''Elric!'') [[role-playing game]] adapting the Corum settings and characters for role-playing.

== Music ==

* The Italian metal band [[Domine]] features Corum in their song ''Prince in the Scarlet Robe'' on their ''Emperor of the Black Runes'' album. They also feature many songs dealing with [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[Elric]] and Moorcock himself is also specifically thanked and noted as an influence in the liner notes for each of their albums.

* The German metal band [[Blind Guardian]] makes brief reference to Corum in their song ''Damned For All Time'' on their ''Follow the Blind'' album and also in the track ''Imaginations From the Other Side'' from the album of the same name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''complex instruction set computer''' ('''CISC''') is a [[microprocessor]] [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) in which each instruction can execute several low-level operations, such as a load from [[Memory (computers)|memory]], an [[arithmetic]] [[operation]], and a [[memory (computers)|memory store]], all in a single instruction. The term was coined in contrast to [[reduced instruction set computer]] ([[RISC]]). 

Before the first RISC processors were designed, many [[computer architecture|computer architects]] tried to bridge the &quot;[[semantic gap]]&quot; - to design instruction sets to support [[high-level programming language]]s by providing &quot;high-level&quot; instructions such as procedure call and return, loop instructions such as &quot;decrement and branch if non-zero&quot; and complex [[addressing mode]]s to allow data structure and array accesses to be combined into single instructions. Additionally, the compact nature of a CISC ISA results in smaller [[program]] sizes and fewer calls to main memory, which at the time (the [[1960s]]) resulted in a tremendous savings on the cost of a computer.

While they achieved their aim of allowing high-level language constructs to be expressed in fewer instructions, it was observed that they did not always result in improved performance. For example, on one processor it was discovered that it was possible to improve performance by ''not'' using the procedure call instruction but using a sequence of simpler instructions instead. Furthermore, the more complex the instruction set, the greater the overhead of decoding any given instruction, both in execution time and silicon area. This is particularly true for processors which used [[microcode]] to decode the (macro)instructions. In other words, adding a large and complex instruction set to the processor even slowed down the execution of simple instructions. Implementing all these complex instructions also required a great deal of work on the part of the chip designer, and many transistors; this left less room on the processor to optimize performance in other ways.

Examples of CISC processors are the [[CDC 6600]], [[System/360]], [[VAX]], [[PDP-11]], [[Motorola 68000]] family and the [[Intel]] [[x86]] CPUs.

The term, like its [[antonym]] [[RISC]], has become less meaningful with the continued evolution of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations.  Modern &quot;CISC&quot; CPUs, such as recent x86 designs like the [[Pentium 4]], whilst they usually support every instruction that their predecessors did, are designed to work most efficiently with a subset of instructions more resembling a typical &quot;[[RISC]]&quot; instruction set.  Indeed, many CISC CPUs (such as modern x86 processors from both [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]) decode many x86 instructions into a series of smaller internal &quot;micro-operations&quot; that are then executed internally by the processor.

The order '''Cetacea''' includes [[whale|whales]], [[dolphin|dolphins]] and [[porpoise|porpoises]].
''Cetus'' is [[Latin]] and is used in biological names to mean &quot;whale&quot;; its original meaning, &quot;large sea animal,&quot; was more general. It comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ketos'' (&quot;[[sea monster]]&quot;). [[Cetology]] is the branch of marine science associated with the study of cetaceans.

'''Cetaceans''' are the [[mammal]]s most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life.  Their body is fusiform (spindle-shaped).  The forelimbs are modified into flippers. The tiny hindlimbs are vestigial; they do not attach to the backbone and are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal flukes.
Cetaceans are nearly hairless, and are insulated by a thick layer of [[blubber]].

The order Cetacea contains eighty-one known species, divided into two suborders, [[Mysticeti]] (baleen whales) and [[Odontoceti]] (toothed whales, which includes dolphins and porpoises).

== Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of cetaceans}}

'''Cetaceans''' (see-taý she-ańs)(L. ''cetus,'' whale) evolved from land mammals (most likely from certain hoofed [[carnivore]]s which also gave rise to the [[artiodactyls]] - the even-hoofed mammals, including [[pigs]] and the [[hippopotamus]]) that once again adapted to marine life about 50 million years ago.

==Adaptations for sea life==

Over a period of millions of years, the cetacean returned to the sea - there was more food there, and more space than on land. Because of this increase in space, there was no natural limit to the cetacean's size (i.e. the amount of weight its legs could hold) since the water provided buoyancy. It had no longer any need for legs.

During this time, the cetacean lost the qualities that fitted it for land existence and gained new qualities for life at sea. Its hind limbs disappeared, its body became more tapered and streamlined - a form that enabled it to move swiftly through the water. For the same reason, most of its fur disappeared, reducing the resistance of the giant body to the water. The cetacean's original tail was replaced by a pair of flukes that acted like a propeller.

As part of this streamlining process, the bones in the cetacean's front limbs fused together. In time, what had been the forelegs became a solid mass of bone, blubber and tissue, making very effective flippers that balance the cetacean's tremendous bulk.

After the cetacean's hair disappeared, it needed some way of preserving body heat. This came in the form of blubber, a thick layer of fat between the skin and the flesh that also acts as an emergency source of energy. In some cetaceans the layer of blubber can be more than a foot thick.

The ear bone called the hammer (malleus) is fused to the walls of the bone cavity where the ear bones are, making hearing in air as good as impossible. Instead sound are transmitted through their jaws and skull bones.

==Breathing, seeing, hearing and echolocation==

Since the cetacean is a mammal, it needs air to breathe. Because of this, it needs to come to the water's surface to exhale its carbon dioxide and inhale a fresh supply of oxygen. Naturally it cannot breathe under water, so as it dives a muscular action closes the [[blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] (nostrils), which remain closed until the cetacean next breaks the surface. When it does, the muscles open the blowholes and warm air is exhaled.

To make this easier, the cetacean's blowholes have moved to the top of its head, giving it a quicker chance to expel the stale air and inhale fresh air. When the stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled it condenses and vapourises as it meets the cold air outside. This is rather like when you breathe out on a cold day and a small cloud of warm air appears. This is called the 'blow', or 'spout', and each cetacean's blow is different in terms of shape, angle and height. This is how cetaceans can be identified at a distance by experienced whalers or whale-watchers.

The cetacean's eyes are set well back and to either side of its huge head. This means that cetaceans with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good binocular vision forward and downward, but others with blunt heads (such as the Sperm Whale) can see either side but not directly ahead or directly behind. The eyes shed greasy tears which protect them from the salt in the water.  Cetaceans also have an almost spherical lens in their eyes, which is most efficient at focusing what little light there is.  However, their vision is generally quite poor (with the exception of the dolphin), which cetaceans make up with their excellent hearing abilities

Akin to the eyes, the cetacean's ears are also small. Life in the sea accounts for the cetacean's loss of its external ears, whose function is to collect sound waves and focus them in order for them to become strong enough to hear well. However, sound waves travel faster through the water than in the air, and so the external ear was no longer needed, and is no more than a tiny hole in the skin, just behind the eye. The inner ear, however, has become so well developed that the cetacean can not only hear sounds tens of miles away, but it can also discern from which direction the sound comes.

Some cetaceans are capable of [[echolocation]].  Mysticeti have little need of it, as they prey upon small fish that would be impractical to locate with echolocation.  Some members of Odontoceti, such as dolphins and porpoises, perform echolocation.  Many toothed whales emit clicks similar to those in echolocation, but we have yet to prove that they echolocate.  Cetaceans use sound in the same way as bats - they emit a sound (called a click), which then bounces off an object and returns to them. From this, cetaceans can discern the size, shape, surface characteristics and movement of the object, as well as how far away it is. With this ability cetaceans can search for, chase and catch fast-swimming prey in total darkness. It is so advanced that most cetaceans can discern between prey and non-prey (such as humans or boats), and captive cetaceans can be trained to distinguish between, for example, balls of different sizes or shapes.

Cetaceans also use sound to communicate, whether it be groans, moans, whistles, clicks or the complex 'singing' of the Humpback Whale that is becoming so popular on wildlife documentaries and relaxation tapes.

==Feeding==

When it comes to food and feeding, cetaceans can be separated into two distinct groups. The 'toothed whales' or Odontoceti usually have lots of teeth that they use for catching fish, squid or other marine life. They do not chew their food, but swallow it whole. In the rare cases that they catch large prey, such as Killer Whales (''Orcinus orca'') catching a fur seal, they tear 'chunks' of it that in turn are swallowed whole. Some examples of the cetaceans in this group include sperm whales, beluga whales, dolphins and porpoises.

The 'baleen whales' or Mysticeti do not have teeth. Instead they have plates made of keratin (the same substance as our fingernails) which hang down from the upper jaw. These plates act like a giant filter, straining small animals (such as [[krill]] and fish) from the seawater. Cetaceans included in this group include the Blue Whale, the Humpback Whale, the Bowhead Whale and the Minke Whale.

It is a fallacy to believe that all Mysticeti feed on plankton, because for some species their prey animals are not plankton. The larger whales tend to eat small shoaling fish, such as herrings and sardine. These fish are called micronecton, and not plankton. One species of Mysticeti, the Gray Whale (''Escrichtius robustus''), is a [[Benthos|benthic]] feeder, primarily eating sea floor [[crustaceans]].

==Misconceptions==

A common misconception about cetaceans is that they are [[fish]]. They're not&amp;mdash;they are [[mammals]].

As mammals, cetaceans have these characteristics that are common to all mammals:
* They are [[warm-blooded]] animals.
* They breathe in air through their [[lungs]].
* They bear their young alive and suckle them on their own [[milk]].
* They have [[hair]] - though generally only a few 'whiskers'.

Another way of discerning a cetacean from a fish is by the shape of the tail. The tail of a fish is vertical and moves from side to side when the fish swims. The tail of a cetacean - called a &quot;fluke&quot; - is horizontal and moves up and down, as cetaceans' spines bend in the same manner as a human spine.

==Taxonomic listing==

The classification here closely follows &quot;Marine Mammals of the World: Systematics and Distribution&quot; by Dale W. Rice (1998). The work has become the standard taxonomy reference in the field. Differences reflect usage of common names and further discoveries since the publication of that work.

'''''The Canterbury Tales''''' is a collection of stories written by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the [[14th century]] (two of them in [[prose]], the rest in [[verse]]). The tales, some of which are originals and others not, are contained inside a [[frame tale]] and told by a group of [[pilgrim]]s on their way from [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] to [[Canterbury, Kent|Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of [[Saint]] [[Thomas à Becket]]'s at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]{{ref|shrine}}. ''The Canterbury Tales'' are written in [[Middle English]].

==The individual tales ==
The themes of the tales vary, and include topics such as [[courtly love]], treachery and avarice. The genres also vary, and include [[Romance (genre)|romance]], [[Breton lai]], [[sermon]], and [[fabliau]]. The characters, introduced in the [[General Prologue]] of the book, tell tales of great cultural relevance.

The Tales include:
*[[General Prologue|The General Prologue]] 
*[[The Knight's Tale]]
*[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale]]
*[[The Reeve's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Cook's Prologue and Tale]]
*[[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Friar's Prologue and Tale]]
*[[The Summoner's Prologue and Tale]] 
[[Image:ChaucerPortraitEllesmereMs.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Chaucer as a Canterbury pilgrim in the [[Ellesmere manuscript]] of ''The Canterbury Tales'']] 
*[[The Clerk's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Merchant's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Squire's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Franklin's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Physician's Tale]] 
*[[The Pardoner's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Shipman's Tale]] 
*[[The Prioress' Prologue and Tale]]
*[[Chaucer's Tale of Sir Topas]] 
*[[The Tale of Melibee]] 
*[[The Monk's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[Chanticleer and the Fox|The Nun's Priest's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Second Nun's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Manciple's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[The Parson's Prologue and Tale]] 
*[[Chaucer's Retraction]] 

Some of the tales are serious and others humorous; however, all are very precise in describing the traits and faults of human nature. Religious malpractice is a major theme as well as focusing on the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]].  Most of the tales are interlinked with similar themes running through them and some are told in retaliation for other tales in the form of an argument. The work is incomplete, as it was originally intended that each character would tell four tales, two on the way to Canterbury and two on the return journey. This would have meant a possible one hundred and twenty tales which would have dwarfed the twenty-six tales actually written. 

People have sought political overtones within the tales, particularly as Chaucer himself was a significant [[courtier]] and political figure at the time, close to the corridors of power.  There are many hints at contemporary events, although few are proven, and the theme of marriage common in the tales is presumed to refer to several different marriages, most often those of [[John of Gaunt]].  Aside from Chaucer himself, Harry Bailly of the Tabard Inn was a real person and the Cook has been identified as quite likely to be Roger Knight de Ware, a contemporary London cook.

==The complete work==
The work was begun some time in the [[1380s]] with Chaucer stopping work on it in the late [[1390s]]. It was not written down fully conceived: it seems to have had many revisions with the addition of new tales at various times. The plan for one hundred and twenty tales is from the general prologue. It is announced by Harry Bailly, the host, that there will be four tales each. This is not necessarily the opinion of Chaucer himself, who appears as the only character to tell more than one tale. It has been suggested that the unfinished state was deliberate on Chaucer's part.
  
The structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is easy to find in other contemporary works, such as ''[[The Book of Good Love]]'' by [[Juan Ruiz]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[Decameron]],'' which may have been one of Chaucer's main sources of inspiration.  Chaucer indeed adapted several of Boccaccio's stories to put in the mouths of his own pilgrims, but what sets Chaucer's work apart from his contemporaries' is his characters.  Compared to Boccaccio's main characters - seven women and three men, all young, fresh and well-to-do, and given Classical names - the characters in Chaucer are of extremely varied stock, including representatives of most of the branches of the middle classes at that time.  Not only are the participants very different, but they tell very different types of tales, with their personalities showing through both in their choices of tales but also in the way they tell them.

The idea of a pilgrimage appears to have been mainly a useful device to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes.  The Monk would probably not be allowed to undertake the pilgrimage and some of the other characters would be unlikely ever to want to attend.  Also all of the pilgrims ride horses, there is no suggestion of them suffering for their religion.  None of the popular [[shrine]]s along the way are visited and there is no suggestion that anyone attends [[mass (liturgy)|mass]], so that it seems much more like a tourist's jaunt.  It may be that Chaucer's intent was to ridicule the sort of people who unthinkingly went on such pilgrimages.

Chaucer does not pay that much attention to the progress of the trip.  He hints that the tales take several days but he does not detail any overnight stays.  Although the journey could be done in one day this speed would make telling tales difficult and three to four days was the usual duration for such pilgrimages.  The 18th of April is mentioned in the tales and [[Walter William Skeat]], a [[19th century]] editor, determined [[17 April]], [[1387]] as the probable first day of the tales.

Scholars divide the tales into ten fragments.  The tales that make up a fragment are directly connected, usually with one character speaking to and handing over to another character, but there is no connection between most of the other fragments.  This means that there are several possible permutations for the order of the fragments and consequently the tales themselves.  The above listing is perhaps the most common in modern times, with the fragments numbered I-X, but an alternative order is listing them A-G, with the tales from the Physician's until the Nun's Priest's placed before the Wife of Bath's.  The exception to the independence between fragments are the last two.  The Manciple's tale is the last tale in XI but fragment X starts with the parson's prologue by saying that the Manciple had finished his tale.  The reason that they are kept as two different fragments is that the Manciple starts his short tale in the morning but the parson's tale is told at four in the afternoon.  It is assumed that Chaucer would have amended his manuscript or inserted more tales to fill the time.

Two early [[manuscript]]s of the tale are the [[Hengwrt manuscript]] and the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].

==Significance==
It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] language, [[English language|English]] (rather than [[French language|French]] or [[Latin]]). However, several of Chaucer's contemporaries&amp;mdash;[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]&amp;mdash;also wrote major literary works in English, making it unclear how much Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.

The title of the work has become an everyday phrase in the language and has been variously adapted and adopted. Recently an animated version of some of the tales has been produced for British [[television]]. As well as a version with [[Modern English]] dialogue, there were versions in the original Middle English and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].  

The postulated return journey has intrigued many and continuations have been written as well as tales written for the characters who are mentioned but not given a chance to speak. The [[Tale of Beryn]] is a tale by an anonymous author within a [[15th century]] manuscript of the work.  The tales are rearranged and there are some interludes in Canterbury, which they had finally reached, and Beryn is the first tale on the return journey, told by the Merchant.  [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Siege of Thebes]]'' is also a depiction of the return journey but the tales themselves are actually prequels to the tale of classical origin told by the Knight in Chaucer's work.

In [[2004]], Professor [[Linne Mooney]] was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Professor Mooney, working at the [[University of Cambridge]], was able to match Pinkhurst's signature on an oath he signed to his lettering on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that was transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.

{{French literature (small)}}
'''Christine de Pizan''' ([[1364]] -[[1430]]) was a remarkable [[medieval]] writer, [[rhetorician]] and critic, who strongly challenged [[misogynist]] thinking by successfully establishing her authority, even in the midst of the male-dominated realm of arts, as a female writer. De Pizan’s prolific writings, forty-one known pieces, written over her career of at least thirty years (1399-1429), earned her fame as Europe’s first professional woman writer (Redfern 74). In particular, her success stems from a wide range of innovative writing techniques that critically challenged renowned male writers who, to Pizan’s dismay, incorporated misogynist scrutiny within their literary works. Overall, de Pizan and her writings have been celebrated and embraced; she is seen as a [[feminist]] foremother who effectively utilized language to demonstrate that women, with distinctive abilities, could play an integral role within society.

==Life==
Christine de Pizan was born in [[Venice]]. She was the daughter of Tommaso di Benvenuto da Pizzano (Thomas de Pizan), a physician, professor of astrology, and Councillor of the Republic of Venice. Following Christine’s birth, Thomas de Pizan accepted an appointment to the court of [[Charles V of France]], as the King’s [[astrologer]], [[alchemist]], and [[physician]]. In this atmosphere, Christine was able to pursue her intellectual interests. She successfully educated herself by immersing herself in languages, the rediscovered classics and humanism of the early Renaissance, and within Charles V’s royal archive that housed a vast amount of manuscripts. However, de Pizan did not assert her intellectual abilities, or establish her authority as a writer until she was widowed at the age of twenty-four. (Redfern 76).

Christine married Etienne du Castel, a royal secretary to the court, at the age of fifteen. She bore three children, a daughter Marie, a son Jean, and another child who died in childhood (Willard 35). However, de Pizan’s familial life was threatened in 1390 when Christine’s husband, while in [[Beauvais]] on a mission with the king, suddenly died in an epidemic (Willard 39). Following du Castel’s death, Christine was burdened by economic disasters. When she tried to collect money due to her husband’s estate, she faced complicated lawsuits regarding the recovery of salary due to her husband (Willard 39). In order to support herself and her family, Christine established literary contacts within the court. By 1393, Christine was writing love [[ballads]], which caught the attention of wealthy patrons within the court (Redfern 77). However, de Pizan’s participation in the first literary quarrel, in 1401-1402, allowed her to move beyond the courtly circles, and to ultimately establish her status as a woman writer.

==Establishing her literary reputation==
[[Image:Christine de Pisan and her son.jpg|thumb|left|Christine de Pizan instructs her son.]]
Early in her literary career, de Pizan involved herself in a renowned literary debate, the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose,” which took place between 1401 and 1402 (Willard 73). Pizan help to instigate this particular debate when she began to question the literary merits of [[Jean de Meun]]’s the ''[[Roman de la Rose|Romance of the Rose]]''. Written in the thirteenth century, the ''Romance of the Rose'' satirizes the conventions of courtly love while also critically depicting women as nothing more than seducers. De Pizan specifically objected to the use of vulgar terms within Jean de Meun’s allegorical poem. She argued that these vulgar terms denigrated the proper and natural function of sexuality, and that such language was inappropriate for female characters such as [[Reason|Lady Reason]]. According to de Pizan, noble women did not use such language (Quilligan 40). Her critique primarily stems from believing that Jean de Meun was purposely slandering women through the debated text. 

The debate itself is quite extensive. However by the end of this drawn out occurrence, the principle issue was no longer Jean de Meun’s literary capabilities. Instead, due to the participation of Christine in the debate, the focus had ultimately shifted to the unjust slander of women within literary texts. This dispute then, helped to establish Christine’s reputation as a female intellectual who could assert herself effectively and defend her claims in the male-dominated literary realm. Her intellectual abilities however, did not cease following this literary debate. Instead, Christine continued to refute abusive literary treatments of women as an authoritative rhetorician. With her own established voice, de Pizan confidently began to counteract traditional, patriarchal, literary discourses.

==Making her mark: de Pizan's literary works==
[[image:Meister der 'Cité des Dames' 002.jpg|thumb|right|Picture from ''The Book of the City of Ladies'']]
By [[1405]], Christine had completed her most successfully literary works, ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' and ''[[The Treasure of the City of Ladies|The Treasure of the City of Ladies or The Book of the Three Virtues]]''. The first of these proves to show the importance of women’s past contributions to society, and the second strives to teach women of all estates how to cultivate useful qualities in order to counteract the growth of misogyny (Willard 135). 

Christine’s final work was a poem eulogizing [[Joan of Arc]], the peasant girl who took a very public role in organizing French military resistance to English domination in the early fifteenth century. Written in 1429, ''The Tale of Joan of Arc'' celebrates the appearance of a woman military leader who according to Christine, vindicated and rewarded all women’s efforts to defend their own sex (Willard 205-205). After completing this particular poem, it seems that Christine, at the age of sixty-five, decided to end her literary career (Willard, 207). The exact date of her death is unknown. However, her death did not indicate a ceased appreciation for her renowned literary works. Instead, her legacy continued on because of the voice she created and established as an authoritative rhetorician.

==De Pizan: an authoritative rhetorician==
[[image:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|left|Christine de Pizan lecturing to a group of men.]]
During the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose,” de Pizan responded to Jean de Montreuil, who had written her a treatise defending the misogynist sentiments within the ''Romance of the Rose''. She begins by claiming that her opponent was an “expert in rhetoric” as compared to herself “a woman ignorant of subtle understanding and agile sentiment.” In this particular apologetic response, Christine belittles her own style. She is employing a rhetorical strategy by writing against the grain of her meaning, also known as antiphrasis (Redfern 80). Her ability to employ rhetorical strategies continued when Christine began to compose literary texts following the “Querelle du Roman de la Rose.” 

Within ''The Book of the City of Ladies'' Christine creates a symbolic city in which women are appreciated and defended. Christine, having no female literary tradition to call upon, constructs three allegorical foremothers: Reason, Justice, and Rectitude. She enters into a dialogue, a movement between question and answer, with these allegorical figures that is from a completely female perspective (Cambell 6). These constructed women lift Christine up from her despair over the misogyny prevalent in her time. Together, they create a forum to speak on issues of consequence to all women. Only female voices, examples and opinions provide evidence within this text. Christine, through Lady Reason in particular, argues that stereotypes of woman can be sustained only if women are prevented from entering the, dominant male-oriented, conversation (Campbell 7). Overall, Christine hoped to establish truths about women that contradicted the negative stereotypes that she had identified in previous literature. She did this successfully by creating literary foremothers that helped her to formulate a female dialogue that celebrated women and their accomplishments. 

In ''The Treasure of the City of Ladies'' Christine highlights the persuasive effect of women’s speech and actions in everyday life. In this particular text, Christine argues that women must recognize and promote their ability to make peace. This ability will allow women to mediate between husband and subjects. She also claims that slanderous speech erodes one’s honour and threatens the sisterly bond among women. Christine then, argued that &quot;skill in discourse should be a part of every woman’s moral repertoire&quot; (Redfern 87). Christine realized that a women’s influence is realized when their speech equates chastity, virtue and restraint. Christine proved that speech, rhetoric, is a powerful tool that women could employ to settle differences and to assert themselves. Overall, Christine presented a concrete strategy that allowed all women, regardless of their status, to undermine the dominant, patriarchal, discourse. 

It is evident then, that Christine de Pizan contributed to the rhetorical tradition as a woman counteracting the dominant discourse of the time. Rhetorical scholars have extensively studied her persuasive strategies. It has been concluded that de Pizan successfully forged a rhetorical identity for herself, and also encouraged all women to embrace this identity by counteracting misogynist thinking through the powerful tool of persuasive dialogue.

[[Image:cathars_expelled.JPG|right|framed|Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209.]]

'''Catharism''' was a [[Dualism|Dualist]] [[religion|religious]] movement with Gnostic elements that originated around the middle of the [[10th century|10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]], branded by the contemporary [[Roman Catholic Church]] either as a [[heresy|heretical]] Christian sect or sometimes as a non-Christian religion. It existed throughout much of [[Western Europe]], but its home was in [[Languedoc]] and surrounding areas in southern [[France]]. 

The name ''Cathar'' most likely originated from [[Greek language|Greek]] &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'&quot;&gt;καθαροί&lt;/span&gt;, &quot;pure ones&quot;. One of the first recorded uses is [[Eckbert von Schönau]], who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: &quot;Hos nostra germania catharos appellat&quot; (&quot;In Germany we call these people Cathars&quot;).

The Cathars were also sometimes labelled '''[[Albigensians]]'''. This name originates from the end of the [[12th century|12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]], and was used by the chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois]] in 1181. The name refers to the southern town of [[Albi]] (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at [[Toulouse]] and in the neighbouring districts.

==Origins==
The beliefs came originally from [[Eastern Europe]] by way of [[trade route]]s. The name of [[Bulgarians]] (Bougres) was also applied to the Albigenses, and they maintained an association with the [[Paulicians]] and [[Bogomils]] of [[Thrace]]. Their doctrines have numerous resemblances to those of the Bogomils and [[Paulicians]]. It is difficult to form any precise idea of the Cathar doctrines, as all the existing knowledge of them is derived from their opponents, and the few texts from the Cathars (the ''Rituel Cathare de Lyon'' and the ''Nouveau Testament en Provencal'') contain very little information concerning their beliefs and moral practices. What is certain is that they formed an anti-[[priest|sacerdotal]] party in opposition to the Catholic Church, and raised a continued protest against perceived corruption of the clergy. The Cathar heretical theologians, called ''Cathari'' or ''perfecti'' by the Catholic Church, were known to themselves, their followers and even their co-citizens as &quot;''bons hommes''&quot; or &quot;''bons chrétiens''&quot;, literally &quot;good men&quot; or &quot;good Christians&quot;, were few in number; the mass of believers (''credentes'') were not initiated into the doctrine at all&amp;mdash;they were allegedly freed from all moral prohibition and all religious obligation, on condition that they promised by an act called ''convenenza'' to become &quot;hereticized&quot; by receiving the ''[[consolamentum]]'', the baptism of the Spirit, before their death.

The first Occitan Cathars appeared in [[Limousin]] between 1012 and 1020. Several were discovered and put to death at [[Toulouse]] in 1022. The synods of Charroux (Vienne) (1028) and Toulouse (1056) condemned the growing sect. Preachers were summoned to the districts of the Agenais and the Toulousain to combat the Cathar doctrine in the 1100s. The Cathars, however, gained ground in the south thanks to the protection given by William, Duke of [[Aquitaine]], and a significant proportion of the southern nobility. The people were impressed by the ''bons hommes'', and the anti-sacerdotal preaching of [[Peter of Bruys]] and [[Henry of Lausanne]] in [[Périgord]].

==Beliefs==

===The human condition===
The Cathars proclaimed there existed within humankind a spark of divine light. This light, or spirit, had fallen into captivity within a realm of corruption &amp;mdash; identified with the material world.  This was a distinct feature of classical [[Gnosticism]], of [[Manichaeism]] and of the theology of the Bogomils. This concept of the human condition within Catharism most probably was due to direct and indirect historical influences from these older (and sometimes also violently suppressed) Gnostic movements.  According to the Cathars, the world had been created by a lesser deity, much like the figure known in classical Gnostic myth as the [[Demiurge]].  This creative force was not the &quot;True God&quot;, though he made pretense of being the &quot;one and only God&quot; before whom was no other. The Cathars identified this lesser deity, the Demiurge, with the being known by the name of [[Satan]]. (It should be noted that most forms of classical Gnosticism had not made this explicit link between the Demiurge and Satan).  Essentially, the Cathars proclaimed that the God worshipped by orthodox Christianity was an imposter, and his church was a corrupt abomination deeply infused by the failings of the material realm.  Spirit &amp;mdash; the vital essence of humanity &amp;mdash; was thus trapped in a flawed physical realm created by a usurper and ruled by his corrupt minions.

===Eschatology===
The goal of Cathar eschatology was liberation from the realm of limitation and corruption identified with material existence. The path to liberation first required an awakening to the intrinsic corruption of the medieval &quot;consensus reality&quot;, including its ecclesiastical, dogmatic, and social structures. Once cognizant of the grim existential reality of human existence (the &quot;prison&quot; of matter), the path to spiritual liberation became obvious: matter's enslaving bonds must be broken. This was a step by step process, accomplished in different measures by each individual. The Cathars apparently recognized the potential of [[reincarnation]]. Those who were unable to achieve liberation during their current mortal journey would return later to continue the struggle. Thus it should be understood that reincarnation was neither a necessary nor a desirable event, but resultant of the fact that not all humans could break the enthralling chains of matter within a single lifetime.  

===Consolamentum===
Cathar society was divided into two general categories, the ''Perfecti'' (Perfects, Parfaits) and the ''Credentes'' (Believers). The Perfecti were the core of the movement, though the actual number of Perfecti in Cathar society was always relatively small, numbering at most a few thousand during any given period. Regardless of their number, they represented the perpetuating heart of the Cathar tradition, the &quot;true Christian Church&quot;. (When discussing the tenets of Cathar faith it must be understood that absolute demands of exteme asceticism fell only upon the Perfecti.)

An individual entered into the community of Perfecti through a ritual known as the [[consolamentum]], a rite that was both sacramental and sacerdotal in nature: sacramental in that it granted redemption and liberation from this world; sacerdotal in that those who had received this rite functioned as the Cathar clergy. Upon reception of the consolamentum, the new Perfectus surrendered his or her worldly goods to the community, vested himself in a simple black robe with cord belt, and undertook a life dedicated to following the example of Christ and His Apostles &amp;mdash; an often peripatetic life of purity, prayer, preaching, charitable work, and total dependence upon alms for material sustanence. Above all, the Perfecti were dedicated to helping others find the road that led from a dark land ruled by a dark lord, to the realm of light that they believed to be humankind's first source and ultimate end.

The perceived goodness of the men and women who were Perfecti was widely witnessed in their own time and land, and they were dubbed in common parlance as the ''bon hommes''. The exemplary behavior of the Perfecti &amp;mdash; so blatantly in contrast on to the corruption of the normative medieval church &amp;mdash; was one the factors that made Catharism difficult to suppress within its homeland. (The Cathar example has been seen as one of the forces subsequently influencing the young [[Francis of Assisi]] and the [[Franciscan|movement]] he founded.)

While the Perfecti lived lives of simplicity, frugality and purity, Cathar ''credentes'' (believers) were not expected to adopt the same stringent lifestyle. Catharism was above all a popular religion and the numbers of those who considered themselves &quot;believers&quot; in the late twelfth century included a sizable portion of the population of Languedoc, counting among them many noble families and courts. These individuals married, ate meat, and led relatively normative lives within the matrix of medieval society &amp;mdash; in contrast to the Perfecti, whom they honored as their exemplars. Though unable to immediately embrace a life of complete purity, the credentes looked toward an eventual time when this would be their calling and path.

Many credentes would also eventually receive the consolumentum as death drew near &amp;mdash; embracing the ritual of liberation at a moment when the heavy obligations of purity required of a Perfecti would be temporally short. Some of those who received the sacrament of the consolamentum upon their death-beds may thereafter have shunned further food or drink in order to give the death process a quicker termination. This has been termed the ''endura''. It was claimed by Cathar opponents that by such action of self-imposed starvation, the Cathari committed suicide to escape this world. Other than at the moment of ''extremis'', however, little evidence exists to support such a Cathar practice more generally.

===Theology===
The Catharist concept of Jesus might be called docetistic (see [[docetism]]) &amp;mdash; theologically speaking, it resembled [[modalistic]] [[monarchianism]] in the West and [[adoptionism]] in the East. Simply put, most Cathars believed that [[Jesus]] had been a pure manifestation of spirit unbounded by the limitations of matter. They embraced the ''[[Gospel of John]]'' as their most sacred text, and completely rejected the [[Old Testament]] &amp;mdash; indeed, most of them  proclaimed that the god of the [[Old Testament]] was by all textual evidence really the [[devil]]. They proclaimed that there was a higher God &amp;mdash; the True God &amp;mdash; and Jesus was his messenger while many in the West who adhered to a modalistic theology proclaimed he was the True God himself. These are views similar to those of [[Marcion]]. The  deity found in the Old Testament had nothing to do with the God of Love known to Cathar faith. He had created the world as a prison, and demanded from these &quot;prisoners&quot; fearful obedience and worship. This false god was in reality &amp;mdash; so proclaimed the Cathari &amp;mdash; a blind usurper who under the most unjust pretexts tormented and murdered those whom he called all too possessively &quot;his children&quot;. (This exegesis upon the Old Testament is not unique to the Cathars, and clearly echoes views found in earlier Gnostic movements and certainly foreshadows later critical voices.)  The dogma of the [[Trinity]] and the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] were also rejected. Belief in [[metempsychosis]], or the transmigration of souls, resulted in logical rejection of [[purgatory]]; for the Cathars, the current world was purgatory enough.

===Social relationships===
From the theological underpinnings of the Cathar faith there came practical injunctions that were potentially destabilizing to the order of medieval society. For instance, Cathars rejected the giving of oaths as wrongful; an oath served to place one under the domination this world.  To reject oaths in this manner was seen as very dangerous in a society where illiteracy was wide-spread and almost all business transactions and pledges of allegiance were based on the giving of oaths.

In Cathar society and religion women were granted an uncommon equality and autonomy, including acceptance as Perfecti, the clerical order of Cathari. Cathars did not perform any rite of marriage, which was seen as a contract of social bondage. Nor was procreation encouraged: bringing more souls into what they considered a dark and sorrowful world was not a blessed act. 

Sexual intercourse and reproduction propagated the slavery of spirit to flesh, and sexual abstinence was considered desirable even in matrimony. Informal relationships (what might be termed [[concubine|concubinage]]) may have been considered preferable to the social contract of marriage among Cathar credentes. Perfecti were expected to observe complete celibacy. Abandonment of a wife or husband (and abrogation of a social contract, though not necessarily a relationship of love) might be necessary for those who would become Perfecti.

The slaying of life was abhorrent to the Cathars, just as was the senseless copulation that produced enslavement in matter. Consequently, abstention from all animal food except fish was enjoined of the Perfecti. (The Perfecti apparently avoided eating anything considered to be a by-product of sexual reproduction, including cheese, eggs, milk and butter.) War and capital punishment were also absolutely condemned, an abnormality in the medieval age, and a fact that prohibited the Cathar Perfecti from bearing arms even in their own defense. 

Such teachings, both theological and practical, brought upon the Cathars firm condemnation from the medieval civil and religious authorities whose social order they threatened.

==Suppression==

In 1147, [[Pope Eugene III]] sent a legate to the affected district in order to arrest the progress of the Cathars. The few isolated successes of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] could not obscure the poor results of this mission, and clearly shows the power of the sect in the south of France at that period. The missions of Cardinal Peter (of St. Chrysogonus) to Toulouse and the Toulousain in 1178, and of Henry, cardinal-bishop of Albano, in 1180&amp;ndash;1181, obtained merely momentary successes. Henry of Albano's armed expedition, where he took the stronghold at Lavaur, did not extinguish the movement. 

The persistent decisions of the councils against the Cathars at this period &amp;mdash; in particular, those of the Council of [[Tours]] (1163) and of the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] (1179) &amp;mdash; had scarcely more effect.  By the time [[Pope Innocent III]] came to power in 1198, he had resolved to suppress the Cathari. The Pope called a formal crusade, appointing a series of leaders to head his holy army.  There followed over forty years of war against the indigenous population.  During this period some 500,000 Languedoc men women and children were massacred. [http://www.languedoc-france.info/12_cathars.htm]

[[Dominic de Guzman|St Dominic]] encountered them while travelling, and tried to combat the strange doctrines. He had concluded that only the best of preachers could win over people who had fallen in with the Cathari sect. This led to the establishment of the [[Dominican Order]] in [[1216]]. The order was to live up to the terms of his famous rebuke, &quot;Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth.&quot;

At first Pope Innocent III tried pacific conversion, and sent a number of legates into the affected regions. They had to contend not only with the Cathars, the nobles who protected them, and the people who venerated them, but also with the [[bishop]]s of the district, who rejected the extraordinary authority which the [[Pope]] had conferred upon his legates. In 1204, Innocent III suspended the authority of the bishops in the south of France. Papal legate Peter of Castelnau, known for excommunicating the noblemen who protected the Cathars, excommunicated the Count of Toulouse as an [[abettor]] of heresy in 1207.  Peter was then murdered near Saint Gilles Abbey in 1208 on his way back to [[Rome]], according to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;probably at the connivance of [[Raymond VI, count of Toulouse]]&quot;.  As soon as he heard of the murder, the Pope ordered his legates to preach the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the Cathars.

This war threw the whole of the nobility of the north of France against that of the south, possibly instigated by a papal decree stating that all land owned by Cathars could be confiscated at will. As the area was full of Cathar sympathisers, this made the entire area a target for northern nobles looking to gain new lands. It is thus hardly surprising that the barons of the north flocked south to do battle for the Church. 

In one famous incident in 1209, most of [[Beziers|Béziers]] were slaughtered by the Catholic forces headed by the Papal legate.  [[Arnaud-Amaury]], the Abbot of Citeaux, was asked how to distinguish between the Catholic and Cathars, and allegedly answered, &quot;Kill them all, God will know his own&quot;. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' denies these words were ever spoken, although they were recorded soon after the event by a respected Church chronicler who was also Arnaud-Amaury's fellow Cistercian. They are also consistent with other sources such as the contemporary Song of the Cusade.

The war also involved [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II]], the king of [[Aragon]], who owned fiefdoms and had vassals in the area. Peter died fighting against the crusade on September 12, 1213 at the [[Battle of Muret]].  

The war ended in the Treaty of Paris (1229), by which the king of France dispossessed the house of Toulouse of the greater part of its [[fiefs]], and that of Béziers of the whole of its fiefs. The independence of the princes of the south was at an end. But in spite of the wholesale massacre of Cathars during the war, Catharism was not extinguished.

In 1215, the bishops of the Catholic Church met at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] under Pope Innocent. One of the key goals of the council was to combat heresy.

The [[Inquisition]] was established in 1229 to root out the Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, [[Carcassonne]] and other towns during the whole of the [[13th century|13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]], and a great part of the [[14th century|14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]], it succeeded in extirpating the movement. From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar citadel of [[Montségur]] was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and the archbishop of Narbonne. On March 16, 1244 a large and symbolically important execution took place, where leaders of Catharism together with more than 200 Cathar laity were thrown into an enormous fire at the ''prat des cramats'' near the foot of the castle. Moreover, the church decreed severe chastisement against all laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars (Council of [[Narbonne]], 1235; see the Bulla of [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] ''[[Ad exstirpanda]]'', 1252). 

Hunted down by the Inquisition and abandoned by the nobles of the district, the Albigenses became more and more scattered, hiding in the forests and mountains, and only meeting surreptitiously. The people made some attempts to overthrow the Inquisition and the French, and insurrections broke out under the leadership of [[Bernard of Foix]], [[Aimerv of Narbonne]] and [[Bernard Délicieux]] at the beginning of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. But at this point vast inquests were set on foot by the Inquisition, which increased its efforts in the district. Precise indications of these are found in the registers of the Inquisitors, [[Bernard of Caux]], [[Jean de St Pierre]], [[Geoffroy d'Ablis]], and others. The sect was exhausted and could find no more adepts, and after 1330 the records of the Inquisition contain few proceedings against Cathars. The last Cathar Perfect, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was executed in 1321. Other movements, such as the [[Waldensians]] and the pantheistic [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] survived into the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and [[15th century|15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century]], until they were gradually replaced by, or absorbed into, early [[Protestant]] sects, such as the [[Hussites]].

==The Holy Grail==

*It has been suggested in some modern fiction and non-fiction books that the Cathars could have been the protectors of the [[Holy Grail]] of Christian mythology, especially in the book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', although modern investigation into this book has largely discredited its findings. 

==Visigoths==

[[Visigoth]]s had settled in the region described as central to Catharism, which separated the political ideology from the Frankish northern provinces or [[Burgundy]].  The Crusade to rid [[Christendom]] of Cathars was a synonym for eradicating the last remnants of [[Arianism]].  The disparity between religious practices had not only been between the Visigoths of Toulouse and [[Franks]] of Paris. However, many later Calvinists in this region were of Berber origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cerebrospinal fluid''' ('''CSF'''), ''Liquor cerebrospinalis'', is a clear bodily fluid that occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] in the [[brain]] (the space between the [[skull]] and the [[cerebral cortex]]&amp;mdash;more specifically, between the [[arachnoid (brain)|arachnoid]] and [[pia mater|pia]] layers of the [[meninges]]). It is basically a [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] solution and acts as a &quot;cushion&quot; or buffer for the cortex.

==Physiology==

Cerebrospinal fluid also occupies the [[ventricular system]] of the brain and the [[spinal cord]]. It is mainly produced by the [[choroid plexus]], but also by the [[ependyma|ependymal lining]] of the brain's ventricles. The CSF is formed by the choroid plexus of the ventricles circulates through the [[interventricular foramina]] into the [[third ventricle]] and then via the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct) into the fourth ventricle space through two lateral apertures and one median aperture and is then absorbed by the [[venous system]] to the blood circulation.

The total amount of cerebrospinal fluid is about 150 ml, and about 500 ml is produced every day, which indicates its very active circulation.

==Pathology==

The cerebrospinal fluid has many putative roles including mechanical protection of the brain, distribution of [[neuroendocrine]] factors, and facilitation of pulsatile [[cerebral blood flow]]. Understanding cardiovascular dynamics is valuable as the flow pattern of arterial blood must be tightly regulated within the brain in order to assure consistent brain [[oxygenation]]. CSF movement allows arterial expansion and contraction by acting like a spring, which prevents wide changes in intracranial blood flow. When disorders of CSF flow occur, they may therefore impact not only CSF movement, but also the intracranial blood flow, with subsequent neuronal and glial vulnerabilities. The venous system is also important in this equation. Infants and patients shunted as small children may have particularly unexpected relationships between pressure and ventricular size, possibly due in part to venous pressure dynamics. This may have significant treatment implications but the underlying pathophysiology needs to be further explored. 

CSF connections with the [[lymphatic system]] have been demonstrated in several [[mammal]]ian systems. Preliminary data suggest that these CSF-lymph connections form around the time that the CSF secretory capacity of the [[choroid plexus]] is developing (in [[uterus|utero]]). There may be some relationship between CSF disorders, including [[hydrocephalus]] and impaired CSF lymphatic transport.  

==Diagnosis and therapy==

Cerebrospinal fluid can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [[neurological disease]]s. Usually, it is obtained by a procedure called [[lumbar puncture]] in an attempt to count the cells in the fluid and to detect the levels of protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of [[central nervous system]] infections (especially [[meningitis]] and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]). Moreover, a cerebrospinal fluid [[Microbiological culture|culture]] examination may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection. By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the [[oligoclonal bands]], an ongoing inflammatory condition (for example, [[multiple sclerosis]]) can be recognized. A [[beta-2 transferrin]] assay is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for e.g. cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of [[hydrocephalus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cordial''' is any invigorating and stimulating preparation; as, a peppermint cordial. The term derives from obsolete [[medicine|medical]] usage, as various beverages were concocted which were believed to be beneficial to one's [[health]], especially for the heart (''cordialis'', Latin). 

[[alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]]ic cordials are also known as [[liqueur|liqueurs]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] ''cordial'' is an extremely sweet (usually entirely artificial) non-alcoholic fruit flavoured drink concentrate that is mixed with [[water]] to taste. This cordial is said to have some medical properties for stomach problems.  [[Squash (drink)|Squash]] is sometimes called a cordial.

A '''cordial''' is also a type of candy, in which a [[fruit]] filling is placed within a [[chocolate]] shell. A well known confectionery of this type is the cherry cordial.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Cronus is not to be confused with [[Chronos]], the personification of time.  Also see [[Cronus (disambugation)]] for other uses.''

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cronus''' ([[Ancient Greek]] '''Κρόνος'''&amp;mdash;of obscure etymology, perhaps related to &quot;horned&quot;), pronounced &quot;kroh'-nuhs&quot;, also called '''Cronos''' or '''Kronos''', was the leader and the youngest of the first generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], divine descendants of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the earth, and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], the sky. He overthrew his father, Uranus, and ruled during the mythological [[golden age|Golden Age]], until he was overthrown by his own son, [[Zeus]], and imprisoned in the depths of the underworld, [[Tartarus]].

As a result of his association with the bountiful and virtuous Golden Age, Cronus was worshiped as a [[harvest]] deity, overseeing crops such as corn and grains, and nature, agriculture, and the progression of time in relation to humans in general. He was usually depicted with a [[sickle]], which he used to harvest crops and which was also the weapon he used to castrate and depose Uranus. In [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], on the twelfth day of every month ([[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]]), a festival called [[Kronia]] was held in honor of Cronus to celebrate the harvest. Cronus was also identified in [[classical antiquity]] with the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].

==In Greek mythology and early myths==
In ancient Greek myths, Cronus envied the power of his father and the ruler of the universe, [[ Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus' mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-armed [[Hecatonchires]] and one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], in [[Tartarus]], so that they would not see the light. Gaia created a great [[sickle]] and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to ask them to kill Uranus. Only Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush. When Uranus met with Gaia Cronus attacked Uranus with the sickle, [[castration|castrating]] him and casting the severed member into the sea. From the blood (or, by a few accounts, [[semen]]) that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the [[Gigantes]], [[Erinyes]], and [[Meliae]] were produced. From the member that was cast into the sea, [[Aphrodite]] later emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons ''titenes'' (&quot;straining ones&quot;) for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act, and this is the source of the name ''Titan''.

In an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan [[Ophion]]. In doing so, he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly.

After dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the [[Hecatonchires]], the [[Gigantes]], and the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] and set the dragon [[Campe]] to guard them. He and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] took the throne of the world as King and Queen. This period of Cronus' rule was called the [[golden age|Golden Age]], as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.

[[Image:Goya - Saturno devorando a su hijo.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] Devours His Children'', [[Francisco Goya]], c. 1815.]]

Cronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]], [[Hestia]], and [[Poseidon]] by Rhea, he swallowed them all as soon as they were born to preempt the prophecy. Finally, when a sixth child, [[Zeus]], was about to be born, Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save Zeus and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children. Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in [[Crete]], and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the [[Omphalos]] Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it is his son.

Rhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on [[Mount Ida, Crete]]. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], while a company of [[Korybantes|Kouretes]], armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the nymph [[Adamanthea]], who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.

Once he had grown up, Zeus used a potion given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to [[vomiting|vomit]] up the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of [[Mount Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[vomit|emetic]] to force him to disgorge the children, or Zeus cut Cronus' stomach open. After freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Gigantes, the Hecatonchires, and the Cyclopes, who forged for him his thunderbolts. In a vast war called the [[Titanomachy]], Zeus and his brothers and sisters, with the help of the Gigantes, Hecatonchires, and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Cronus and the Titans were confined in [[Tartarus]]. Ironically, Zeus also imprisoned the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopes there as well, just as his father and grandfather had; as a result, Gaia sired the monster [[Typhon]] to claim revenge, though Zeus was victorious.

Other children Cronus is reputed to have had include [[Chiron]], by [[Philyra]], and [[Eris]], by [[Nyx]].

An earlier version of Cronus, from before worship of Zeus became popular, is considered to be connected to the [[Semitic]] deity [[Baal|Ba`al Hammon]]. The baby-eating myth of Cronos is considered to derive from such early religions, as Ba`al Hammon was sometimes worshipped by [[Moloch]], child sacrifice by burning within a statue of Ba`al Hammon.

==In Roman mythology and later culture==
{{main|Saturn (mythology)}}

While the Greeks considered Cronus a force of chaos and disorder, believing that the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans, the Romans had a more positive view of the deity. Although the Roman deity [[Saturn]] was conflated heavily with Cronus, the Romans favored Saturn much more than the Greeks did Cronus. While Cronus was considered a cruel and tempestuous deity to the Greeks, his nature under Roman influence became more innocuous, with his association with the Golden Age eventually causing him to become the god of &quot;human time&quot;, i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests&amp;mdash;not to be confused with [[Chronos]], the unrelated embodiment of time in general. While the Greeks largely neglected Cronus, considering him a mere intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of Roman mythology and [[Roman religion|religion]]; [[Saturnalia]] was a festival dedicated in his honor, and at least one [[Temple of Saturn|temple to Saturn]] existed in the early [[Roman Kingdom]].

As a result of Cronus' importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on [[Western culture]]. In accordance with the Near Eastern tradition, the seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week was also called in [[Latin]] ''Dies Saturni'' (&quot;Day of Saturn&quot;), which in turn degraded to the [[English language|English]] ''[[Saturday]]''. In [[astronomy]], the planet [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] is called so because of Roman influence. It was considered the seventh and outermost of the [[seven heavenly objects]] that are visible with the naked eye.

==In Neopaganism==
{{Greek myth (Titan)}}

Modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] have a rather [[New Age]] view of Cronus. In particular, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] Neopagan [[sect]]s in the United States hold many metaphoric interpretations of the myths regarding Cronus. Sometimes called the &quot;All Consumer&quot;, in many ways Cronus is similar to Christian myths regarding [[Satan]], though the similarity of the Roman name &quot;Saturn&quot; is a coincidence. In accordance with the Greek mythological traditions, Cronus is believed by many to be a cruel and malevolent god that feeds on dominance and subjugation.

Cronus is often believed to be a great and terrible Titan imprisoned in [[Tartarus]], which is envisioned as a place of eternal torment in many ways similar to [[Hell]]. Cronus is typically seen as a horrible tyrant god, and believed to force those cast into Tartarus into prostration before him as they are tormented by Erinyes, Cyclopes, and various other enties, comparable to the role of Judaeo-Christian [[demon]]s. New Age Neopagan artistic representations of Cronus often depict him as having horns like a [[sheep|ram]], derived both from the comparisons to Satan (and thus originally from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and from the obscure etymology where ''Cronus'' is believed to mean &quot;Horned One&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In the real-time strategy computer game [[Age of Mythology]], Cronus&amp;mdash;who is called Kronos within the game&amp;mdash;is equivocated with [[Chronos]], the personification of time in Greek mythology. While Cronus was often seen as a god of agriculture to the Greeks, Kronos in the game is the Titan of [[Time]]. He is also seen as more of a demonic figure than in traditional Greek mythology. He plays a villain role.

In the action adventure computer game [[God of War]], Cronus&amp;mdash;who like above is also called Kronos&amp;mdash;is the last living titan who was made to carry the mountain which held the The Temple of Pandora on his back. It is said that Kronos died after one thousand years of wandering the desert sands of Greece with the mountain chained to him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles F. Hockett''' ([[January 17]], [[1916]] - [[November 3]], [[2000]]) was an important [[United States|American]] [[linguistics|linguistic]] theorist who developed many influential ideas of American [[structuralism#Structuralism in linguistics|structuralism]], and a student of [[Leonard Bloomfield]].

Born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], he received a joint B.A. and M.A. from [[Ohio State University]] in [[1936]]. In [[1939]], he received his doctorate from [[Yale University]].

He represents the post-Bloomfieldian phase of structuralism: the distributionalism or taxonomic structuralism. In his &quot;Note on Structure&quot; he argues that linguistics can be seen as a game and as a science. A linguist as player has a freedom for experimentation on all the utterances of a language, but no criterion to compare his analysis with other linguists'. A linguist as scientist classifies given utterances and is able not only to analize, but also to predict other utterances of a language. The accuracy of such a prediction allows to judge about the merits of the analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Consilience''', or the unity of knowledge (literally a &quot;jumping together&quot; of knowledge), has its roots in the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek concept]] of an intrinsic orderliness that governs our cosmos, inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with mystical views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The rational view was recovered during the high Middle Ages, separated from theology during the [[Renaissance]] and found its apogee in the Age of [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Then, with the rise of the modern sciences, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. The converse of consilience is [[Reductionism]].

The word ''consilience'' was apparently coined by [[William Whewell]], in ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,''  [[1840]].  In this synthesis Whewell explained that, &quot;The Consilience of Inductions takes place when an [[inductive reasoning|Induction]], obtained from one class of facts, coincides with an Induction obtained from another different class.  Thus Consilience is a test of the truth of the Theory in which it occurs.&quot;  The [[Scientific method]] has become almost universally accepted as the exclusive method for testing the status of any scientific hypothesis or theory.  &quot;Inductions&quot; which arise out of applications of the scientific method are, by definition, the only accepted indicators of consilience.

Modern views understand that each branch of knowledge studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. Atomic physics underlies the workings of chemistry, which studies emergent properties that in turn are the basis of biology. Psychology can no longer be separated from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of neurons and synapses.   Sociology, economics, and anthropology are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans. Their limits have constrained history.

The word had remained shelved until the end of the 20th century, when it was vividly revived in ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]],'' a [[1998]] book by the humanist biologist [[Edward Osborne Wilson]], as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', 1959.  Wilson's assertion was that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers &quot;a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws.&quot; This is the essence of consilience.

The idea of consilience informs contemporary studies in complex adaptive systems, as being presented in a [http://www.princeton.edu/~complex/site/Princeton seminar] (see links).

A parallel view lies in the term [[universology]], which literally means &quot;the science of the universe.&quot; Universology was first advocated for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a 19th century utopian futurist and anarchist. Compare the concept of [[Holism]].

'''Clarence Brown''' ([[May 10]], [[1890]] &amp;ndash; [[August 17]], [[1987]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]. Brown was educated as an [[engineer]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] before coming into the [[film]] industry as an assistant to [[Maurice Tourneur]]. He worked with Tourneur for seven years and they co-directed two of Brown's first three films. Brown moved to Universal in 1924 and then to [[MGM]], where he stayed until the mid-[[1940s]]. At MGM he was one of the main director of their female stars &amp;ndash; he directed [[Joan Crawford]] five times and [[Greta Garbo]] five times as well.

He worked across the introduction of sound and continued to use the [[silent film]]s visual techniques throughout his career; he did not work particularly well with dialogue. His works can be regarded as considerate and atmospheric, but too often were conventional, placid and slow.  Nevertheless, he was nominated seven times for an [[Academy Award]] (six times as a director, once as a [[film producer|producer]]) but never received the Oscar.

The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], is named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conciliation''' is an [[alternative dispute resolution]] process whereby the parties to a dispute (including future interest disputes) agree to utilize the services of a conciliator, who then meets with the parties separately in an attempt to resolve their differences.  Conciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award. Conciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that the main goal is to conciliate, most of the time by seeking concessions. In mediation, the mediator tries to guide the discussion in a way that optimizes parties needs, takes feelings into account and reframes representations. 

In conciliation the parties seldom, if ever, actually face each other across the table in the presence of the conciliator. (This latter difference ''can'' be regarded as one of species to genus. Most practicing mediators refer to the practice of meeting with the parties separately as &quot;caucusing&quot; and would regard conciliation as a specific type or form of mediation practice -- &quot;[[shuttle diplomacy]]&quot; -- that relies on exclusively on caucusing. All the other features of conciliation are found in mediation as well.)

If the conciliator is successful in negotiating an understanding between the parties, said understanding is almost always committed to writing (usually with the assistance of legal counsel) and signed by the parties, at which time it becomes a legally binding contract and falls under contract law. 

Recent studies in the processes of [[negotiation]] have indicated the effectiveness of a technique which deserves mention here.  A conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation).  The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important.  She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to &quot;give&quot; on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn.  The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives which are not on the list compiled by parties on the other side. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.

Most successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the [[Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Cyclone''' [[programming language]] is intended to be a safe dialect of the [[C programming language]]. Cyclone is designed to avoid [[buffer overflow]]s and other vulnerabilities that are endemic in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for [[systems programming]].

Cyclone was jointly developed by [[Greg Morrisett]]'s group at [[Cornell University]] and [[AT and T Labs Research|AT&amp;T Labs Research]] in the early 2000s. It received a certain amount of publicity in November 2001. As of June 15, 2004, the Cyclone compiler stands at version 0.8.1.

== Language features ==
Cyclone attempts to avoid some of the common pitfalls of the [[C programming language]], while still maintaining the look and performance of C. To this end, Cyclone places the following restrictions upon programs:
* &lt;code&gt;[[NULL]]&lt;/code&gt; checks are inserted to prevent [[segmentation fault]]s
* [[Pointer arithmetic]] is restricted
* Pointers must be initialized before use
* [[Dangling pointer]]s are prevented through region analysis and limitations on [[Malloc|&lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt;]]
* Only &quot;safe&quot; casts and unions are allowed
* [[Control flow | &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;]] into scopes is disallowed
* [[Control flow | &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;]] labels in different scopes are disallowed
* Pointer-returning functions must execute &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Setjmp/longjmp|&lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;]] are not supported

In order to maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:
* '''Never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointers''' do not require &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks
* '''&quot;Fat&quot; pointers''' support pointer arithmetic with run-time [[bounds checking]]
* '''Growable regions''' support a form of safe manual memory management
* '''[[Garbage collection (computer science)|Garbage collection]]''' for heap-allocated values
* '''[[Tagged union]]s''' support type-varying arguments
* '''Injections''' help automate the use of tagged unions for programmers
* '''[[Polymorphism (computer science)|Polymorphism]]''' replaces some uses of [[void pointer|&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;]]
* '''varargs''' are implemented as fat pointers
* '''[[Exception handling|Exceptions]]''' replace some uses of &lt;code&gt;setjmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt;

For a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, please see [http://www.research.att.com/projects/cyclone/papers/cyclone-safety.pdf].

Although Cyclone looks, in general, much like [[C programming language|C]], it should be thought of as a [[:Category:C dialects|C-like language]]. With that, let us look at more features of the language, in depth.

===Pointer/reference types===
Cyclone implements three kinds of [[reference]] (following C terminology these are called pointers):
* &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (the normal type)
* &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; (the never-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer), and
* &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (the only type with [[pointer arithmetic]] allowed, &quot;fat&quot; pointers).
The purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers. Take for instance a function, called &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; that takes a pointer to an int:

 int foo(int *);

Although the person who wrote the function &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; could have inserted &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks, let us assume that for performance reasons they did not. Calling &lt;code&gt;foo(NULL);&lt;/code&gt; will result in [[undefined behavior]] (typically, although not necessarily, a '''SIGSEGV''' being sent to the application). To avoid such problems, Cyclone introduces the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; pointer type, which can never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the &quot;safe&quot; version of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; would be:

 int foo(int @);

This tells the Cyclone compiler that the argument to &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; should never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, avoiding the aforementioned undefined behavior. The simple change of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; saves the programmer from having to write &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; checks and the operating system from having to trap &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer dereferences.  This extra restriction, however, can be a rather large stumbling block for most C programmers, who are used to being able to manipulate their pointers directly with arithmetic. Although this is desirable, it can lead to [[buffer overflow]]s and other &quot;off-by-one&quot;-style mistakes. To avoid this, the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer type is delimited by a known bound, the size of the array. Although this adds overhead due to the extra information stored about the pointer, it improves safety and security. Take for instance a simple (and naïve) &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; function, written in C:

 int strlen(const char *s)
 {
     int iter = 0;
     if (s == NULL) return 0;
     while (s[iter] != '\0') {
        iter++;
     }
     return iter;
 }

This function assumes that the string being passed in is terminated by NUL (&lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;). However, what would happen if &lt;code&gt;char&amp;nbsp;buf[]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{'h','e','l','l','o','!'};&lt;/code&gt; were passed to this string? This is perfectly legal in C, yet would cause &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to iterate through memory not necessarily associated with the string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. There are functions, such as &lt;code&gt;strnlen&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to avoid such problems, but these functions are not standard with every implementation of [[ANSI C]]. The Cyclone version of &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; is not so different from the C version:

 int strlen(const char ? s)
 {
    int iter, n = s.size;
    if (s == NULL) return 0;
    for (iter = 0; iter &lt; n; iter++, s++) {
       if (*s == '\0') return iter;
    }
    return n;
 }

Here, &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; bounds itself by the length of the array passed to it, thus not going over the actual length. Each of the kinds of pointer type can be safely cast to each of the others, and arrays and strings are automagically cast to &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; by the compiler. (Casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; invokes a [[bounds checking|bounds check]], and casting from &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; invokes both a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; check and a bounds check. Casting from &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; results in no checks whatsoever; the resulting &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; pointer has a size of 1.)

===Dangling pointers and region analysis===
Consider the following code, in C:

 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20];
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    return buf;
 }

This returns an object that is allocated on the stack of the function &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, which is not available after the function returns. While [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] and other compilers will warn about such code, this will typically compile without warnings:

 char *itoa(int i)
 {
    char buf[20], *z;
    sprintf(buf,&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    z = buf;
    return z;
 }

Cyclone does regional analysis of each segment of code, preventing dangling pointers, such as the one returned from this version of &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;. All of the local variables in a given scope are considered to be part of the same region, separate from the heap or any other local region. Thus, when analyzing &lt;code&gt;itoa&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler would see that &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer into the local stack, and would report an error.

===Manual memory management===
== Examples ==
The best example to start with is the classic [[Hello world]] program:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;core.h&gt;
 using Core;
 int main(int argc, string_t ? args)
 {
    if (argc &lt;= 1) {
       printf(&quot;Usage: hello-cyclone &lt;name&gt;\n&quot;);
       return 1;
    } else {
       printf(&quot;Hello from Cyclone, %s\n&quot;, args[1]);
    }
    return 0;
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the term counter used in electronics and computing. For other meanings of counter, see [[counter (disambiguation)]]''

In general, a '''counter''' is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular [[event]] or [[process]] has occurred often in relationship to a [[clock signal]].  In practice, there are two types of counters:
*[[up counter]]s which increase ([[increment]]) in value
*[[down counter]]s which decrease ([[decrement]]) in value



== Counters in electronics ==

In [[electronics]], counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], and a wide variety of designs exist, e.g:

* Asynchronous (ripple) counters
* Synchronous counters
* Johnson counters
* Decade counters

Each is useful for different applications. Usually, counter circuits are [[digital]] in nature, and count in [[binary code|binary]], or sometimes [[binary coded decimal]]. Many types of counter circuit are available as digital building blocks, for example a number of chips in the [[4000 series]] implement different counters.

The simplest counter circuit is a single [[Flip-flop_%28electronics%29#D_flip-flop|D-type flip flop]], with its D (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows. By cascading a series of D-type flip flops, a ripple counter is formed, which can count to 2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; where n is the number of bits (flip flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows &quot;ripple&quot; from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division [[ratio]] overall is. (To clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit - the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).

[[Image:4_bit_counter.png|thumb|400px|right|A 4-bit synchronous counter]]Where a stable count value is important across several bits, which is the case in most counter systems, synchronous counters are used. These also use flip-flops, either the D-type or the more complex J-K type, but here, each stage is clocked simultaneously by a common clock signal. [[Logic gate]]s between each stage of the circuit control data flow from stage to stage so that the desired count behaviour is realised. Synchronous counters can be designed to count up or down, or both according to a direction input, and may be presettable via a set of parallel &quot;jam&quot; inputs. Most types of hardware-based counter are of this type.

Decade counters are a kind of counter that counts in tens rather than having a binary representation. Each output will go high in turn, starting over after ten outputs have occurred. This type of circuit finds applications in [[multiplexer]]s and demultiplexers, or wherever a scanning type of behaviour is useful. Similar counters with different numbers of outputs are also common.

A Johnson counter is a special case of [[shift register]], where the output from the last stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage. A pattern of bits equal in length to the shift register thus circulates indefinitely. These counters are sometimes called &quot;walking ring&quot; counters, and find specialist applications, including those similar to the decade counter, digital to analogue conversion, etc.

== Counters in computer science ==

In [[Computability theory (computation) | computability theory]], a '''counter''' is considered a type of memory. A  counter stores a single [[natural number]] (initially [[0 (number)|zero]]) and can be [[bignum|arbitrarily-many digits long]].  A counter is usually considered in conjunction with a [[finite state machine]] (FSM), which can perform the following operations on the counter:
* Check whether the counter is zero
* Increment the counter by one
* Decrement the counter by one (if it's already zero, this leaves it unchanged).

==Power==
The following machines are listed in order of power, with each one being strictly more powerful than the one below it:
# Deterministic or Non-deterministic FSM plus two counters
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one [[Stack (computing)|stack]]
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic or Non-deterministic FSM 

For the first and last, it doesn't matter whether the FSM is deterministic or non-deterministic (see [[determinism]]).  They have equivalent power.  The first two and the last one are levels of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

The first machine, an FSM plus two counters, is equivalent in power to a [[Turing machine]].  This equivalence can be shown in three steps.  First, a Turing machine can be simulated by two stacks.  Then, a stack can be simulated by two counters.  Finally, four counters can be simulated by two counters.

===Step 1: A Turing machine can be simulated by two stacks.===
A Turing machine consists of an FSM and an infinite tape, initially filled with zeros, upon which the machine can write ones and zeros.  At any time, the read/write head of the machine points to one cell on the tape.  This tape can be conceptually cut in half at that point.  Each half of the tape can be treated as a [[Stack (computing)|stack]], where the top is the cell nearest the read/write head, and the bottom is some distance away from the head, with all zeros on the tape beyond the bottom.  Accordingly, a Turing machine can be simulated by an FSM plus two stacks.  Moving the head left or right is equivalent to popping a bit from one stack and pushing it onto the other.  Writing is equivalent to changing the bit before pushing it.

===Step 2: A stack can be simulated by two counters.===
A stack containing zeros and ones can be simulated by two counters, when the bits on the stack are thought of as representing a binary number, with the top being the least significant bit.  Pushing a zero onto the stack is equivalent to doubling the number.  Pushing a one is equivalent to doubling and adding 1.  Popping is equivalent to dividing by 2, where the [[remainder]] is the bit that was popped.  Two counters can simulate this stack, in which one of the counters holds a number whose binary representation represents the bits on the stack, and the other counter is used as a scratchpad.  To double the number in the first counter, the FSM can initialize the second counter to zero, then repeatedly decrement the first counter once and increment the second counter twice.  This continues until the first counter reaches zero. At that point, the second counter will hold the doubled number.  Halving is performed by decrementing one counter twice and increment the other once, and repeating until the first counter reaches zero.  The remainder can be determined by whether it reached zero after an even or an [[odd number]] of tries.

===Step 3: Four counters can be simulated by two counters.===
As before, one of the counters is used as scratchpad.  The other, real counter holds an [[integer]] whose [[prime number|prime]] [[factorization]] is 2&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;7&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The exponents ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' can be thought of as four virtual counters that are being simulated.  If the real counter is set to zero then incremented once, that is equivalent to setting all the virtual counters to zero.  If the real counter is doubled, that is equivalent to incrementing ''a'', and if it's halved, that's equivalent to decrementing ''a''.  By a similar procedure, it can be multiplied or divided by 3, which is equivalent to incrementing or decrementing ''b''.  Similarly, ''c'' and ''d'' can be incremented or decremented.  To check if a virtual counter such as ''c'' is equal to zero, just divide the real counter by 5, see what the remainder is, then multiply by 5 and add back the remainder.  That leaves the real counter unchanged.  The remainder will have been nonzero if and only if ''c'' was zero.

As a result, an FSM with two counters can simulate four counters, which are in turn simulating two stacks, which are simulating a Turing machine.  Therefore, an FSM plus two counters is at least as powerful as a Turing machine.  A Turing machine can easily simulate an FSM with two counters, therefore the two machines have equivalent power.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Clay Mathematics Institute''' ('''CMI''') is a private, non-profit foundation, based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and dedicated to increasing and disseminating [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge. It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 by businessman [[Landon T. Clay]], who financed it, and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] mathematician [[Arthur Jaffe]].

==The Millennium Prize problems==

The institute is best known for its establishment on [[May 24]], [[2000]] of the '''Millennium Prize problems'''.  These seven problems are considered by CMI to be &quot;important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years&quot;.  The first person to solve each problem will be awarded $1,000,000 by CMI - thus solving all the problems will amount to $7,000,000.  In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to [[Hilbert's problems]], which were proposed in [[1900]], and had a substantial impact on [[20th century]] mathematics.  Of the initial twenty-three Hilbert problems, the only one which is still unsolved (or unproven) is The Riemann hypothesis, which was formulated in 1859 and is today one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.

The seven Millennium Prize problems are:
* [[Complexity classes P and NP|P versus NP]]
* [[Hodge conjecture|The Hodge conjecture]]
* [[Poincaré conjecture|The Poincaré conjecture]]
* [[Riemann hypothesis|The Riemann hypothesis]]
* [[Yang-Mills existence and mass gap]]
* [[Navier-Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness]]
* [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture|The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]]

=== P versus NP ===

The question is whether there are any problems for which a computer can verify a given solution quickly, but cannot find the solution quickly.  This is generally considered the most important open question in [[computation|theoretical computer science]].  See [[complexity classes P and NP]] for a more complete discussion.

=== The Hodge conjecture ===

The [[Hodge conjecture]] is that for [[projective space|projective]] [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Hodge cycle]]s are rational  [[linear combination]]s of [[algebraic cycle]]s.

=== The Poincaré conjecture ===

In [[topology]], a sphere with a two-dimensional surface is essentially characterized by the fact that it is [[simply connected]].  The [[Poincaré conjecture]] is that this is also true for spheres with three-dimensional surfaces.  The question has been solved for all dimensions above three.  Solving it for three is central to the problem of classifying 3-manifolds.  A solution to this conjecture has been proposed by [[Grigori Perelman]]; while still not formally published, there does appear to be a growing consensus that the argument is largely correct.

=== The Riemann hypothesis ===

The [[Riemann hypothesis]] is that all nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] have a real part of 1/2.  A proof or disproof of this would have far-reaching implications in [[number theory]], especially for the distribution of [[prime number]]s.  This was [[Hilbert's eighth problem]], and is still considered an important open problem a century later. [[Louis de Branges de Bourcia]], a French mathematician, claims to have the proof for the problem, unfortunately this proof has not yet been seriously analyzed.

=== Yang-Mills existence and mass gap ===

In physics, [[quantum Yang-Mills theory]] describes particles with positive mass having classical waves traveling at the speed of light.  This is the [[mass gap]].  The problem is to establish the existence of the Yang-Mills theory and a mass gap.

=== Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness ===

The [[Navier-Stokes equations]] describe the movement of liquids and gases.  Although they were found in the 19th century, they still are not well understood. The problem is to make progress toward a mathematical theory that will give us insight into these equations.

=== The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture ===

The [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] deals with a certain type of equation, those defining [[elliptic curve]]s over the [[rational number]]s. The conjecture is that there is a simple way to tell whether such equations have a finite or infinite number of rational solutions. [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] dealt with a more general type of equation, and in that case it was proven that there is no way to decide whether a given equation even has any solutions.

== Other activities ==

Besides the Millennium Prize Problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute also supports mathematics via the awarding of
research fellowships (which range from two to five years, and are aimed at younger mathematicians), as well as shorter-term
scholarships for programs, individual research, and book writing.  The Institute also has a yearly [[Clay Research Award]], recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research.  Finally, the Institute also organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians (from the high school to postdoctoral level).

A '''cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)''' is a [[congenital disorder]] of [[blood vessel]]s within the [[human brain|brain]], characterized by tangle(s) of [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]]. While an [[arteriovenous malformation]] can occur elsewhere in the body, this article discusses malformations found in the brain.

==Symptoms==
The most frequently observed problems related to the mechanical and blood loss ([[ischemia |ischemic]]) effects of an AVM are [[headache]] and [[seizure]]. Moreover, AVMs in certain critical locations may stop the circulation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], causing accumulation of the fluid within the skull and giving rise to a clinical condition called [[hydrocephalus]]. 

Symptoms of bleeding within the brain ([[intracranial hemorrhage]]) include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, [[incontinence]], and blurred vision.  A stiff neck can occur as the result of increased pressure within the skull and irritation of the meninges. Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are possible, these can include seizure, [[hemiparesis]], a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body, or deficits in language processing ([[aphasia]]).  A variety of other symptoms can accompany this type of [[cerebrovascular accident]].

Generally, intense headache, perhaps coincident with seizure or loss of bodily consciousness, is the first indication of a cerebral AVM.  Estimates of the number of AVM-afflicted people in the United States range from 0.1% to 0.001% [http://www.nypneuro.org/healthinfo/stroke.html] [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/avms/avms.htm] of the population.

==Diagnosis==
An AVM diagnosis is established by [[neuroimaging]] studies.  A [[computed tomography]] scan of the head (head CT) is usually performed, this can reveal the site of the bleed.  More detailed pictures of the tangle of blood vessels that compose an AVM can be obtained by using radioactive reagents injected into the blood stream, then observing these reagents using a [[fluoroscope]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI).  A spinal tap ([[lumbar puncture]]) can be used to examine spinal fluid for red blood cells; this condition is indicative of leakage of blood from the bleeding vessels into the [[subarachnoid space]].  The best images of an AVM are obtained through [[cerebral angiography]], which involves using a catheter, threaded though an artery, to deliver the reagent close to the site of the AVM.

==Pathophysiology==
While the cause of AVMs remains unknown, the main risk is [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. This risk is difficult to quantify.   Approximately 70% of cases with cerebral AVM are discovered through symptoms caused by sudden bleeding, bleeding due to the fragility of abnormally structured brain vessels.  However, some patients may remain asymptomatic or have minor complaints due to the local effects of the tangle of vessels. If a rupture or bleeding incident occurs, the blood may penetrate either into the brain tissue ([[cerebral hemorrhage]]) or into the [[subarachnoid space]].  This space is located between the sheaths ([[meninges]]) surrounding the brain ([[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]).

Once an AVM bleeds, the probability of rebleeding increases substantially.

AVMs that do not bleed may cause symptoms by either directly compressing the brain tissue or decreasing the blood flow to the neighbouring tissues and thus causing a lack of blood flow ([[ischemia]]). Both mechanical and ischemic factors cause a permanent and continuous loss of nerve cells ([[neuron]]s).

==Treatment==
The treatment in the case of sudden bleeding is focused on restoration of vital function.  Anticonvulsant medications such as [[phenytoin]] are often used to control seizure; medications or procedures may be employed to relieve intracranial pressure.  Eventually, curative treatment may be required to prevent recurrent hemorrhage.  

Surgical removal of the blood vessels involved ([[craniotomy]]) is the preferred curative treatment for most types of AVM.  While this surgery results in an immediate, complete removal of the AVM, risks exist.

Radiation treatment ([[radiosurgery]]) has been widely used on smaller AVMs with considerable success.  The Gamma Knife, developed by Swedish physician [[Lars Leksell]], is one apparatus used in radiosurgery to precisely apply a controlled radiation dosage to the volume of the brain occupied by the AVM. While this treatment is [[non-invasive]], two to three years may pass before the complete effects are known.  Complete [[occlusion]] of the AVM may or may not occur.

[[Embolization]], that is, occlusion of blood vessels via coils or screens introduced by a radiographically guided catheter, is frequently used as an adjunct to either surgery or radiation treatment.  However, embolization alone is rarely successful in completely blocking blood flow through the AVM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the constant comparative method by [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], see [[Grounded theory]].''

The '''comparative method''' (in [[linguistics]]) is a method used to detect genetic relationships between languages and to establish a consistent relationship hypothesis by reconstructing:

*the common ancestor of the languages in question,
*a plausible sequence of regular changes by which the historically known languages can be derived from that common ancestor.

The comparative method is the &quot;gold standard&quot; by which mainstream linguists judge whether two languages are related; relation is deemed certain only if a reconstruction of the common ancestor (or at least a partial reconstruction) is feasible.  Other approaches to the problem that have been proposed, such as [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s &quot;[[mass lexical comparison]]&quot; method, are still considered too unreliable by most linguists.

==Genetically Related languages==

In the present context, &quot;related&quot; has a specific meaning:  two languages are said to be [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]]ally related if they are descended from the same ancestor language.  Thus, for example, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] are both descended from [[Latin]].  &quot;Descent&quot;, in turn, is defined in terms of transmission across the generations: children learn a language from the parents' generation and are then influenced by their peers; they then transmit it to the next generation, and so on (how and why changes are introduced is a complicated, unresolved issue).  A continuous chain of speakers across the centuries links Vulgar Latin to all of its modern descendants.

This definition of relatedness implies that even if two languages are quite similar in their vocabularies, they are not necessarily closely related.  Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] in fact takes more of its words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] than from its  direct ancestor, [[Indo-Iranian languages|Proto-Indo-Iranian]].  This is because of heavy [[borrowing]] over the years from Arabic into Persian.  But under the definition just given, Persian is considered to be descended from Proto-Indo-Iranian, and not from Arabic. 

The comparative method is a method for proving relatedness in the sense just given, as well as a method for reconstructing the proto-phonemes of a languages of a family and uncovering the phonological changes the languages of a family have undergone.

==How the comparative method works==
{{IPA notice}}
Although there is no concrete set of steps to be followed in the application of the comparative method, linguists generally agree on the basic steps, which are as follows:

===1. Assemble cognate lists===

Relationship between two (or more) languages can be suspected if they show a number of regular correspondences in lexicon, which means that there is a regularly recurring match between the phonetic structure of words with similar meanings. Thus, this step simply involves making lists of words which are likely cognates among the languages being compared. For example, looking at the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian family]], we might come up with the following list (although in practice a real list would be much longer):

{| class=wikitable
! Gloss
! [[Tongan language|Tongan]]
! [[Samoan language|Samoan]]
! [[Rarotongan language|Rarotongan]]
! [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]
! [[Maori language|Māori]]
|-
| &quot;one&quot;
| ''taha''
| ''tasi''
| ''{{IPA|taʔi}}''
| ''{{IPA|(ʔe-)kahi}}''
| ''tahi''
|-
| &quot;two&quot;
| ''ua''
| ''lua''
| ''rua''
| ''{{IPA|(ʔe-)lua}}''
| ''rua''
|-
| &quot;three&quot;
| ''tolu''
| ''tolu''
| ''toru''
| ''{{IPA|(ʔe-)kolu}}''
| ''toru''
|-
| &quot;four&quot;
| ''fā''
| ''fā''
| ''{{IPA|ʔā}}''
| ''{{IPA|(ʔe-)hā}}''
| ''{{IPA|ɸā}}''
|-
| &quot;five&quot;
| ''nima''
| ''lima''
| ''rima''
| ''{{IPA|(ʔe-)lima}}''
| ''rima''
|-
| &quot;man&quot;
| ''taŋata''
| ''taŋata''
| ''taŋata''
| ''kanaka''
| ''taŋata''
|-
| &quot;sea&quot;
| ''tahi''
| ''tai''
| ''tai''
| ''kai''
| ''tai''
|-
| &quot;forbidden&quot;
| ''tapu''
| ''tapu''
| ''tapu''
| ''kapu''
| ''tapu''
|-
| &quot;octopus&quot;
| ''feke''
| ''{{IPA|feʔe}}''
| ''{{IPA|ʔeke}}''
| ''{{IPA|heʔe}}''
| ''{{IPA|ɸeke}}''
|-
| &quot;canoe&quot;
| ''vaka''
| ''{{IPA|vaʔa}}''
| ''vaka''
| ''{{IPA|waʔa}}''
| ''waka''
|-
| &quot;enter&quot;
| ''hū''
| ''ulu''
| ''uru''
| —
| ''uru''
|}

However, caution needs to be exercised to avoid including borrowings or false cognates in the list, which could skew or obscure the correct data. This problem can usually be overcome by using basic vocabulary (such as kinship terms, numbers, body parts, pronouns, and other basic terms). Nonetheless, basic vocabulary can be borrowed ([[Finnish language|Finnish]], for example, borrowed the word for &quot;mother,&quot; ''äiti'', from [[Gothic language|Gothic]], while [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], a [[Muran languages|Muran language]] of South America, borrowed all its pronouns from [[Língua Geral|Nhengatu]];  likewise, English borrowed the pronouns ''they'', ''them'', and ''their(s)'' from [[Old Norse language|Norse]]).

===2. Establish correspondence sets===

Once cognate lists are established, the next step is to determine the regular sound correspondences they exhibit. The notion of regular correspondence is very important here: mere phonetic similarity, as between English ''day'' and [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dies'' (both with the same meaning), has no probative value. English initial ''d-'' does '''not''' regularly match Latin ''d-'', and whatever sporadic matches can be observed are due either to chance (as in the above example) or to borrowing (e.g. Latin ''diabolus'' and English ''devil'', both ultimately of Greek origin). The [[Neogrammarian]]s ([[German language|German]] ''Junggrammatiker''), a group of radical young German linguists, mostly from the University of Leipzig, first emphasized this point in the late 1800s. Their motto, &quot;sound laws have no exceptions,&quot; has remained a fundamental idea in historical linguistics to this day.

For example, although the correspondence ''d-'' : ''d-'' (where the notation &quot;A : B&quot; means &quot;A corresponds to B&quot;) in English and Latin ''day'' and ''dies'' above is not regular, English and Latin '''do''' exhibit a very regular correspondence of ''t-'' : ''d-''. For example (in Latin, &lt;c&gt; represents /k/):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! English
! Latin
|-
| ''ten''
| ''decem''
|-
| ''two''
| ''duo''
|-
| ''tow''
| ''duco''
|-
| ''tongue''
| ''dingua'' (Old Latin)
|-
| ''tooth''
| ''dent-''
|}

Since a really systematic correspondence can hardly be accidental, if we can rule out alternative possibilities like massive borrowing, the correspondence can be attributed to common descent. If there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), and if they add up to a sensible pattern (one that could have been produced by known types of sound change), and if some of the correspondences are non-trivial (''t : t'' is trivial but ''{{IPA|ŋ}} : b'' is not), then common origin becomes a virtual certainty.

===3. Discover which sets are in complementary distribution===

During the time the comparative method was being developed (late 18th to late 19th century), two major developments occurred which improved the method's effectiveness.

First, it was found that many sound changes are conditioned by a particular '''context'''.  Thus for example, in both Greek and Sanskrit, an aspirated stop evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later on in the same word; this is the so-called &quot;[[Grassmann's law]]&quot;, known to the ancient Indian grammarians and promulgated as a historical discovery by [[Hermann Grassmann]].

Second, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred in ''contexts that were later lost''.  For instance, in Sanskrit [[velar]]s (''k''-like sounds) were replaced by [[palatal]]s (''ch''-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was ''*i'' or ''*e'' (the asterisk means that the sound is inferred rather than historically documented).  Subsequent to this change, all instances of ''*e'' were replaced by ''a'' (or, more accurately, earlier ''*e'', ''*o'', and ''*a'' merged as ''a'').  The situation would probably have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of ''e'' and ''a'' been recoverable from the evidence of other Indo-European languages.  Thus, for instance, Latin ''que'', &quot;and,&quot; preserves the original ''e'' vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| (1)
| ''*ke''
| Pre-Sanskrit &quot;and&quot;
|-
| (2)
| ''*ce''
| Velars replaced by palatals before ''*i'' and ''*e''
|-
| (3)
| ''ca''
| ''*e'' becomes ''a''
|}

''Ca'' is the attested Sanskrit form for &quot;and.&quot;  This finding was made independently by several scholars during the 1870's.

In the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], velar [[plosive]]s in [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian]] have been replaced by the corresponding palatal if the velar plosive is followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/eː/}}. However this change is absent in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and few other languages in the family. For example, Proto-Dravidian ''*kedi'' becomes Tamil ''chedi'', but Kannada ''gida''.

[[Verner's Law]], discovered by [[Karl Verner]] in about 1875, is a similar case: the voicing of consonants in [[Germanic languages]] underwent a change that was determined by the position of the old Indo-European accent.  Following the change, the accent shifted across the board to initial position. Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with data from Greek and Sanskrit accent. For full discussion, see [[Verner's Law]].

This stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets involve identical or similar sounds, and apply in [[complementary distribution]], then the sets can be assumed to reflect a single original phoneme. This is because &quot;some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set&quot; (Campbell 2004:136).

To take another example, when we examine the [[Romance languages]], descended from Latin, we find two different correspondence sets which both involve ''k'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! [[Italian language|Italian]]
! [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
! [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]
! [[French language|French]]
|-
| (1)
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
|-
| (2)
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''k''
| ''{{IPA|ʃ}}''
|}

What we do in this situation is try to see if the two sets occur in complementary distribution (in which case they reflect a single proto-phoneme) or if both occur in identical environments (in which case they must both reflect separate proto-phonemes). In this case, we discover that French ''{{IPA|ʃ}}'' only occurs before ''a'' in the other languages (which becomes ''{{IPA|ɛ}}'' in French), while French ''k'' occurs elsewhere. Both sets (1) and (2) can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case ''*k'', spelled &lt;c&gt;).

A more complex case involves consonant clusters in [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], which have been notoriously difficult to reconstruct. The Algonquianist [[Leonard Bloomfield]], however, looked at the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages of Proto-Algonquian, and came up with the following correspondence sets (although the clusters are shown here ending in ''-k'', this also generally applies to clusters ending in any of the plosives; &lt;š&gt; and &lt;č&gt; are [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] symbols for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʧ/}}):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]
! [[Fox language|Meskwaki]]
! [[Cree language|Plains Cree]]
! [[Menominee language|Menomini]]
|-
| (1)
| ''kk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
|-
| (2)
| ''kk''
| ''hk''
| ''sk''
| ''hk''
|-
| (3)
| ''sk''
| ''hk''
| ''sk''
| ''čk''
|-
| (4)
| ''šk''
| ''šk''
| ''sk''
| ''sk''
|-
| (5)
| ''sk''
| ''šk''
| ''hk''
| ''hk''
|}

Although all 5 correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set (his reconstructions were, respectively, ''*hk'', ''*xk'', ''*čk'', ''*šk'', and ''çk'' (the modern reconstructions for these clusters are ''*hk'', ''*tk'', ''čk'', ''šk'', and ''rk'', respectively, and two more clusters, reconstructed as ''{{IPA|*ʔk}}'' and ''{{IPA|ɬk}}'', are recognized).

===4. Reconstruct proto-phonemes===

This step tends to be much more subjective than the previous ones. A linguist here has to rely mostly on their general intuitions about what types of sound changes are likely and which are unlikely. For example, the voicing of voiceless plosives between vowels is an extremely common sound change, occurring in languages all over the world, which the devoicing of voiced plosives between vowels is extremely uncommon. Therefore, if a linguist were comparing two languages with a correspondence of ''-t-'' : ''-d-'' between vowels, they would reconstruct the proto-phoneme as being ''*-t-'', and assume that it became voiced to ''-d-'' in the second language (unless they had a very good reason not to). 

It is important to keep in mind, however, that there are sometimes changes that are extremely unexpected. The Proto-Indo-European word for &quot;two,&quot; for example, is reconstructed as ''*duwō'', which is reflected in [[Armenian language|Classical Armenian]] as ''erku''. Several other cognates demonstrate that the change ''*d-'' → ''erk-'' in the history of Armenian was a regular one. Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] of [[Slavey language|Slavey]], there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan ''*ts'' → Bearlake ''{{IPA|kʷ}}''.  Obviously, ''*d-'' did not change directly into ''erk-'' and ''*ts'' did not change directly into ''{{IPA|kʷ}}'', but they instead must have gone through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. The lesson here is that with enough sound changes, a given sound can change into just about any other sound. This is why it is not '''phonetic similarity''' which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but '''regular sound correspondences'''.

Another assumption used in determining a proto-phoneme is that our reconstruction should ideally involve as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. In other words, unless there is persuasive evidence to the contrary, we should reconstruct for a proto-phoneme whatever value is the most common reflex in the daughter languages. For example, in the [[Algonquian languages]], we find the following correspondence set:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]
! [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]]
! [[Cree language|Cree]]
! [[Lenape language|Munsee]]
! [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]]
! [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]
|-
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''m''
| ''b''
|}

Obviously, we should reconstruct either ''*m'' or ''*b'' for this set. Both ''*m'' → ''b'' and ''*b'' → ''m'' (where &quot;*A → B&quot; means &quot;*A becomes B&quot;) are concievable sound changes, so the principle of reconstructing &quot;likely&quot; changes over &quot;unlikely&quot; ones is not useful here. Instead, linguists note that the reflex of this proto-phoneme is ''m'' in five of the languages compared here, and ''b'' in one of them. If we reconstruct ''*b'', we need to assume five separate changes of ''*b'' → ''m'', whereas if we reconstruct ''*m'', we only need to assume a single change of ''*m'' → ''b'' in one language in the family. Since we are working on the assumption that our reconstructions should require the fewest number of changes possible to arrive at the modern reflexes, we would obviously reconstruct ''*m'' here.

===5. Examine the reconstructed system typologically===

In the final step, the linguist takes all the proto-phonemes they have reconstructed using steps 1-4, and checks to see how the system fits with what is currently known about [[linguistic typology|typological constraints]]. For example, if the reconstructed phonemes fit together in the following system, the linguist would be suspicious, because languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &amp;nbsp; p &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; t &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; k &amp;nbsp;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; b &amp;nbsp;
!
! 
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; n &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; ŋ &amp;nbsp;
|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; l &amp;nbsp;
!
|}

In this reconstructed system, there is only one voiced plosive, ''*b'', and although there is an [[apical]] and velar [[nasal]], ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'', there is no corresponding [[labial]] nasal. In this case, we would have to return to step 4 and reevaluate our earlier conclusions. In this case, we would try to figure out if there is any evidence to suggest that what we earlier reconstructed as ''*b'' is actually ''*m'', or evidence that what we earlier reconstructed as ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'' are actually ''*d'' and ''*g''.

Even a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] plosive inventory, as traditionally reconstructed, is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
![[Labial]]s
![[Apical]]s
![[Velar]]s
![[Labiovelar]]s
|-
![[Voiceless consonant|Voiceless]]
| align=center|p
| align=center|t
| align=center|k
| align=center|{{IPA|kʷ}}
|-
![[Voiced consonant|Voiced]]
| align=center|(b)
| align=center|d
| align=center|g
| align=center|{{IPA|gʷ}}
|-
![[Voiced consonant|Voiced]] [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]
| align=center|{{IPA|bʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|dʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|gʱ}}
| align=center|{{IPA|gʷʱ}}
|}

Lately, however, a number of linguists have argued that this system is, at best, very suspicious typologically. It extremely unlikely, or maybe even impossible, they say, for a language to have a voiced aspirated ([[breathy voice]]) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. These linguists therefore argue, on typological grounds, that we need to reevaluate the traditional reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. A potential solution was provided by [[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]], who argued that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as [[Glottalization|glottalized]] — either [[implosive]] {{IPA|(ɓ, ɗ, ɠ)}} or [[ejective]] {{IPA|(pʹ, tʹ, kʹ)}}. The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be seen as just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both. This has become known as the [[Glottalic theory|Glottalic Theory]], and although it has not yet become accepted, it does have a large number of proponents, and is an excellent example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction

The reconstruction of proto-sounds and their historical transformations enables us to proceed further: we can compare grammatical morphemes (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of declension and conjugation, and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage can never be complete (for example, proto-[[syntax]]  is far more elusive than [[phonology]] or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and all elements of linguistic structure undergo inevitable erosion and gradual loss or replacement over time), but a consistent partial reconstruction can and must be attempted as proof of genetic relationship.

==Weaknesses of the comparative method==

While most historical linguists continue to use the comparative method, many of them now also recognize quite a few serious weaknesses in the method. In recent years, alternatives to the comparative method have been proposed (see [[Mass lexical comparison]]), in part due to percieved problems inherent to the method.

===The Neogrammarian Hypothesis===
The first weakness of the comparative method is the fundamental Neogrammarians' assumption that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions&quot;.  This assumption is problematic even on theoretical grounds: the very fact that different languages evolved according to different sound-change laws seems to indicate a degree of arbitrariness in language evolution.  Moreover, once one accepts that sound changes may be conditioned by context according to rather complicated rules, one opens the door for &quot;laws&quot; that may affect only a few words, or even a single word; which is logically equivalent to admitting exceptions to the broader laws. This problem has led some critics to a radically opposite position, summarized by the maxim &quot;each word has its own history.&quot;

====Borrowings and random mutations====
Even the Neogrammarians recognized that, apart from the general sound change laws, languages are also subject to borrowings from other languages and other ''sporadic changes'' (such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation) that affect one word at a time, or small subsets of words.

While borrowed words should be excluded from the analysis, on the grounds that they are not ''genetic'' by defintion, they do add noise to the data, and thus may hide systematic laws or distort their analysis.  Moreover, there is the danger of circular reasoning — namely, of assuming that a word has been borrowed solely because it does not fit the current assumptions about the regular sound laws.

The other exceptions to the sound laws are a more serious problem, because they occur in generic language transmission.  One example of such a sporadic change, with no apparent logical reason, is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for &quot;word,&quot; ''palabra''. By regular sound changes from Latin, it should have become ''parabola'', but the ''r'' and ''l'' changed places by sporadic [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]).

In principle, As those sporadic changes accumulate, they will increasingly obscure the systematic sound laws, and eventually prevent the recognition of the genetic relationship between languages, or lead to incorrect reconstructions of proto-languages and incorrect family trees.

====Analogy====
A source of sporadic changes that was recognized by the  Neogrammarians themselves was [[analogy (linguistsics)|analogy]], in which a word is sporadically changed to be closer to another word in the lexicon which is perceived as being somehow related to it. For example, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for &quot;nine,&quot; by regular sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], should have been {{IPA|/nʲevʲatʲ/}}, but is actually {{IPA|/dʲevʲatʲ/}}.  It is believed that the initial ''{{IPA|nʲ-}}'' changed to ''{{IPA|dʲ-}}'' due to influence of the word for &quot;ten&quot; in Russian, {{IPA|/dʲesʲatʲ/}}.

====Gradual application====
More recently, [[William Labov]] and other linguists who have studied contemporary language changes in detail have discovered that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors.  Often the sound change begins to affect some words in a language, and then gradually spreads to others. These observations considerably weaken the Neogrammarians axiom that &quot;sound laws have no exceptions.&quot;

===Problems with the tree model===
Another weakness of the comparative method is its reliance on the so-called &quot;Tree Model&quot; (German ''Stammbaum''). In this model, daughter languages are seen as branching out from the proto-language, gradually growing more and more distant from the proto-language through accumulated phonological, morpho-syntactical, and lexical changes; and possibly splitting into further daughter languages. This model is usually representd by upside-down tree-like diagrams. For example, here is a diagram of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family of languages, spoken throughout the southern and western [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]:

[[Image:Uto-Aztecan Family Tree.jpg|none|720px|center]]

(Families are in '''bold''', individual languages in ''italics''. Not all of the branches and languages are shown, for lack of space.)

====The Wave Model====
Unfortunately, the tree model does not reflect the reality of how languages change. Since languages change gradually, there are long periods in which different dialects of a language, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even once they are completely separated, languages which are near to one another will continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family will often spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change may partially overlap like waves on the surface of a pond, across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range (Fox 1995:129) The following diagram illustrates this conception of language change, called the ''Wave Model'':

[[Image:Wave_Model_Schmidt.jpeg|none|300px|center]]

This is a serious challenge to the comparative method, which is entirely based on the assumption that each language has a single &quot;genetic&quot; parent, and hence that the genetic relationship between two languages is due to their descent from a common ancestor.

===Non-uniformity of the proto-language===
Another assumption implicit in the methodology of the comparative method is that the proto-language is uniform. However, even in extremely small language communities there are always [[Dialect|dialect differences]], whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors (the Pirahã language of Brazil is spoken by only several hundred people, but has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women, for example). Therefore, the single proto-language reconstructed by the comparative method is, in all likelihood, a language which never existed.

===Creoles===
Another potential problem for the comparative method is the phenomenon of [[creole language]] formation, where essentially a new language is formed from a complicated combination of two languages that are not closely related. The [[papiamentu]] language, spoken in the [[Caribbean]], is a notable example.  In these events, the new language may end up with a lexicon and phonology which is derived from both parent languages, in varying proportions; while the grammar (morphology and syntax) is partly inherited, and partly the result of local innovation.  Often function words from one of the parent languages are inherited, but used for a completely different function in the creole.  

Creole formation seems to be a fairly common phenomenon. Dozens of such events have been documented in the last 500 years, in the wake of European colonial expansion, and many more must have happened along the fringes of past empires.  While the comparative method may be able to detect the existence of a genetic relation between the creole and the parent languages (or between two creoles with shared parents), the reconstructed &quot;proto-language&quot; is likely to be a thoroughy artificial construct.

===Subjectivity of the reconstruction===
While the identification of systematic sound correspondences between known languages is failry objective, the reconstruction of their common ancestral language is inherently subjective.  In the proto-Algonquian example above, the choice of ''m'' as the parent phoneme is only ''likely'', not ''certain''. It is quite possible that a proto-Algonquian language with ''b'' in those locations split into two branches, one which preserved ''b'' and one with ''m'' instead; and while the first originated only the Arapaho, the second spread out wider and  originated all the other Algonquian tribes.  (Such dramatic asymmetries in the growth of different branches of the same tree are actually common; contrast for example the Romance and Celtic branches of Indo-European.) It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the Algonquian languages used some other sound intead, such as ''p'', which eventually mutated to ''b'' in one branch and to ''m'' in the other.  

Since the reconstruction of a proto-language involves many of these choices, the probability of making a wrong choice is very high.  That is, any reconstructed proto-language is ''almost certainly'' incorrect; it is an artificial construct that is accepted by convention, not by rigorous proof.  These hidden errors take their toll when two reconstructed proto-languages are compared in order to build large family trees.

===Assessment===
In view of these weaknesses, we must be wary of the reconstructions and trees obtained with the comparative method. Most linguists, however, continue to use it, although they now recognize its flaws. Fox (1997:141-2), for example, concludes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Comparative Method ''as such'' is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...The interpretative processes must therefore weight up the evidence provided by the Comparative Method in conscious knowledge of these weaknesses, and in the light of other relevant considerations, if they are to give historical validity to the reults. ...Our interpretation of the findings of the method have doubtless changed as more has been learnt of the historical processes involved, and this has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The  '''Council of Constance''' was an [[ecumenical council]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], called by the [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Sigismund]], a supporter of [[Antipope John XXIII|Antipope John XXIII]], the pope recently elected at Pisa. The council was held from [[November 16]], [[1414]] to [[April 22]], [[1418]] in [[Konstanz|Constance]].  Its main purpose was to end the [[Western schism|Papal schism]] which had resulted from the [[Avignon Papacy]], or as it is sometimes known, the &quot;[[Babylonian Captivity of the Church]].&quot;  The Council of Constance marked the high point of the [[Conciliarism|Conciliar movement]] to reform the Church.  The Catholic Church, however, only regard as valid and ecumenical those sessions of the Council that were held after the confirmation of the Council by true Pope Gregory XII. 


The previous sessions, held under the authority of Emperor Sigismund and anti-pope &quot;John XXIII&quot; are not considered valid, and its decrees (including the famous decree Haec Sancta, on Conciliarism), are regarded by the Catholic Church as null and void, since, according to catholic doctrine, an Ecumenical Council is only valid when convened or at least accepted by the Pope, and its decrees are only binding if approved or confirmed by the Roman Pontiff.

At the time the council was called, there were three [[pope|popes]], all of whom claimed legitimacy.  A few years earlier, in one of the first blows of the  Conciliar movement, the bishops at the [[Council of Pisa]] had deposed both of the two claimant popes and elected a third pope, claiming that in such a situation, a council of bishops had greater authority than just one bishop, even if he be the bishop of Rome.  This had only furthered the schism.

An innovation at the Council was that instead of voting as individuals, the bishops voted in [[nation]]al blocs, explicitly confirming the national pressures that had fueled the schism since 1378.

The famous ''Haec sancta'' decree contradicting [[Vatican I]] on papal primacy/infallibility was promulgated in the sixth session, [[April 6]], [[1415]]. Its declaration that
:''legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit, constituting a general council and representing the catholic church militant, it has power immediately from Christ; and that everyone of whatever state or dignity, even papal, is bound to obey it in those matters which pertain to the faith, the eradication of the said schism and the general reform of the said church of God in head and members.''
marks the high water mark of the Conciliar movement of reform  [http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum16.htm]. This decree, however, is not considered valid by the Catholic Church, since it was never approved by the true Pope, Gregory XII, and was passed by the Council in a session that was held before the summons of the Pope. (The first sessions of the Council of Constance were an invalid and illicit assembly of Bishops, gathered under the authority of Emperor Sigismund and anti-pope &quot;John XXIII&quot;. Only later was the same Bishops summoned by the true Pope, Gregory XII, to assemble, in the same place, as an Ecumenical Council, under the presidency of the Papal legates sent by Pope Gregory. Only the sessions held after that summons are regarded by the Catholic Church as part of the true Council of Constance.

Thus, what historians describe as &quot;the Council of Constance&quot; were, in fact, two different assemblies in the eyes of the Catholic Church and its canon law. The first part is regarded as an illicit assembly, incapable of issuing any valid decree. The second part is regarded as a true Ecumenical Council. The Bishops that were already assembled in Constance accepted to be re-summoned by the authority of Gregory XII since it was known that Gregory XII was willing to resign, so as to allow the election of another Pope, that could be accepted by the whole of Christiandom. 

With the support of the [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], enthroned before the high altar of the cathedral of Constance, the Council of Constance recommended that all three popes abdicate, and that another be chosen. In part because of the constant presence of the emperor, other rulers demanded that they have a say in who would be pope.  Much of the Council's time was therefore occupied with trying to placate secular rulers rather than in actual reform of the Church and its hierarchy. 

Gregory XII then sent representatives to Constance, duly empowered by him with full powers to summon, open and preside over an Ecumenical Council, and also empowered to present his resignation to the Papacy. This would pave the way for the end of the Western Schism. 

The legates were received by Emperor Sigismund and by the assembled Bishops, and the Emperor yielded the presidency of the proceedings to the papal legates, Cardinal Dominici of Ragusa and Prince Charles of Malatesa. On 4 July, 1415 the Bull of Gregory XII which appointed Malatesta and Cardinal Dominici of Ragusa as his proxies at the council was formally read before the assembled Bishops. The cardinal then read a decree of Gregory XII which convoked the council and authorized its succeeding acts. Thereupon, the Bishops voted to accept the summons. Prince Malatesa immediately informed the Council that he was empowered by a commission from Pope Gregory XII to resign the Papal Throne on the Pontiff's behalf. He asked the Council whether they would prefer to receive the abdication at that point or at a later date. The Bishops voted to receive the Papal abdication immediately. Hereupon the commission by Gregory XII authorizing his proxy to resign the Papacy on his behalf was read and Malatesta, acting in the name of Gregory XII, pronounced the resignation of the papacy by Gregory XII and handed a written copy of the resignation to the assembly.

Former Pope Gregory XII was then created Cardinal Bishop of Porto by the Council, with rank immediately below the Pope (which made him the highest ranking person in the Church, since, due to his abdication, the See of Peter was vacant). Gregory XII´s cardinals were accepted as true cardinals by the Council, but the members of the council delayed electing a new pope for fear that a new pope would restrict further discussion of pressing issues in the Church. 

By the time the anti-popes were all deposed and the new Pope, Martin V, was elected, two years had passed since Gregory XII´s abdication, and Gregory was already dead.

A second goal of the council was to continue the reforms begun at the Council of Pisa.  These reforms were largely directed against [[John Wyclif]], mentioned in the opening session, and condemned in the eighth, [[May 4]], [[1415]] and [[Jan Hus]],  and their followers. [[Jan Hus]], summoned to Constance under a letter of indemnity, was condemned by council and [[burned at the stake]] notwithstanding on [[July 6]], [[1415]].

The council also attempted to direct ecclesiastical reforms. However, once two anti-popes, [[Baldassare Cossa]] (John XXIII), who fled from Constance on March 20, 1415, and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Peter de Luna]] (Benedict XIII) had been eliminated, the successor to [[Urban VI]] was induced to resign, with great care to protect the legitimacy of the succession, ratifying all his acts, a new pontiff was chosen. The new pope, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], elected November 1417, soon asserted the absolute authority of the papal office, and the claim that a council might be superior to a single pope was set aside when it was later declared that a council of Bishops has no greater authority than the Pope.

During the council there were also political topics discussed, such as the accusation by the [[Teutonic Knights]] that [[Poland]] was defending [[Paganism|pagans]]. [[Pawel Wlodkowic]], [[rector]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], presented there the theory that all nations, including pagan ones, have the right to self-govern and to live in peace and possess their land, which is one of the earliest ideas of [[international law]]. The creation of a book on how to die was ordered by the council, and thus written in 1415 called ''[[Ars moriendi]]''.

The upshot was that reforms were stymied by sheer inertia of the establishment, conflicting national interests and the full assertion of [[papal supremacy]] once more. The acts of the Council were not made public until 1442, at the behest of the [[Council of Basel]]; they were printed in 1500.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Churches Uniting in Christ''' (CUIC) brings together nine [[mainline]] [[United States|American]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] (including both predominantly [[whites|white]] and predominantly [[African American|black]] churches), and was inaugurated on [[January 20]], [[2002]].

CUIC is the successor organization to the '''Consultation on Church Union''' (COCU) founded in [[1962]]. The original task of COCU was to negotiate a [[merger]] between its ten member denominations; however, the membership of the denominations overwhelmingly rejected a merger when it was proposed in [[1969]]. With the failure of the merger proposal, COCU then turned to negotiating &quot;[[intercommunion]]&quot;, whereby each member church would retain its own autonomy and identity, while recognizing the validity of the rites and [[religious minister|ministry]] of the others and accepting them as true churches. In [[1991]] it was proposed that this was to be done on the historic model of [[bishop]], [[presbyter]] and [[deacon]]. However, the [[Presbyterian Church USA]] was unwilling to implement some of the changes to its internal rules that this model would require, and the [[Episcopal|Episcopal Church]] did not feel able to participate at the time. It was then proposed that intercommunion be established without a resolution of the ministry issue, which would be resolved by [[2007]] by means of intensive dialog between the churches. This modified proposal was then accepted by the member churches.

CUIC is not a merger, but rather an intercommunion agreement whereby each member recognizes the others as part of the true church, and recognizes its rites ([[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]]) as valid. The original proposal for CUIC also had a full recognition of each other's ministers, but the Episcopal Church's insistence on the historic episcopate, which conflicts with the method of administration in some other member churches (especially in the [[Presbyterian Church USA]]), has meant that this part of the CUIC proposal has been put on hold. CUIC will however hold negotiations once it is established, possibly leading to a full recognition of each other's ministers within the next few years.

The '''Canadian Unitarian Council''' (CUC) is the national body for [[Unitarian Universalist]]s in [[Canada]]. 

The CUC is a member of the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]].

== Principles and Sources ==

The Principles and Sources
of Our Religious Faith

=== Principles ===

We, the member congregations of the Canadian Unitarian Council, covenant to affirm and promote:

* the inherent worth and dignity of every person;
* justice, equity, and compassion in human relations;
* acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
* a free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
* the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
* the goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
* respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

=== Sources ===

The living tradition which we share draws from many sources:

* direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;
* words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;
* wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;
* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbours as ourselves;
* Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit;
* spiritual teachings of Earth-centred traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.

Grateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision. As free congregations we enter into this covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support.

The current [http://www.cuc.ca/who_we_are/principles/principles_sources.htm Principles and Sources] are based on the UUA's [http://www.uua.org/aboutuua/principles.html Principles and Purposes].  The CUC has created a [http://cuc.ca/sptf/ task force] to consider revising them.

== Organisation ==

The CUC is divided into 4 regions: &quot;BC&quot; (British Columbia), &quot;Western&quot; (Alberta to Thunder Bay), &quot;Central&quot; (Between Thunder Bay and Kingston), and &quot;Eastern&quot; (Kingston, Ottawa and everything east of that).

Member congregations are served by volunteer Service Consultants, Congregational Networkers, and a series of other committees.  There are two director of regional services one for the Western two regions, and one for the Eastern two regions.  The Director of Lifespan Learning oversees development of religious education programming.  The UUA provides a Regional Organising Consultant for developing Young Adult and Campus Ministry in Canada (part time).

== Founding ==

This section quoted from [http://www.cuc.ca/who_we_are/colony_to_nation.htm THE CUC: FROM COLONY TO NATION 1961-2002] by Rev. Dr. Charles W. Eddis:

The formation of the CUC  was a long-held dream.  Proposals to form a Canadian organization were made by G.C. Holland, minister of the Ottawa church, in 1898, Samuel A. Eliot, President of the American Unitarian Association in 1908, Charles Huntingdon Pennoyer, minister of the Halifax Universalist Church in 1909, and Horace Westwood, a Unitarian minister in Winnipeg in 1913.  In 1946 The Commission on the Work of the Churches of the British Unitarians recommended that &amp;ldquo;the Assembly should interest itself in the formation of a Canadian Unitarian Association which many Unitarians there believe to be necessary.&amp;rdquo;

The first native seeds were planted with the publication of The Canadian Unitarian in Ottawa from 1940 to 1946, a small newsletter distributed with the newsletters of Canadian churches.  After the Second World War, the  growth of the Unitarians in Canada began to show the strength which would make some Canadian organization feasible, if not imperative.  Unitarians, most notably  Toronto ministers, generated considerable media attention from the centre of Canada&amp;rsquo;s English language media.  The Unitarian Service Committee of Canada, founded in 1945, was receiving considerable attention both in city newspapers and on television, so much so  that the word &amp;ldquo;Unitarian&amp;rdquo;  became a household world,  though its meaning was not that widely known.  In 1946 there were six Icelandic Unitarian churches with 272 members, and five English-speaking churches with 1,049 members.  The Universalists had five churches with 459 members.  In 1961 there were three Universalist churches with 68 members, and three Icelandic and eleven English-speaking Unitarian churches with 3,476 members, and in addition 22 Unitarian fellowships with 773 members.  The Universalists almost disappeared in Canada, outside of a small rural church in southwest Ontario, and were probably saved in the other two surviving locations by influx of Canadian Unitarians.  By contrast, Unitarian membership more than tripled in the same fifteen years.  In 1953 there were six Unitarian ministers serving congregations in Canada.  Ten years later there were five ministers in the Toronto area alone.   

In early April, 1961, a meeting with delegates from ten congregations was held in Montreal.  The plan was approved 8 to 1, with the understanding that &amp;ldquo;The Council will function within the framework of the continental Unitarian Universalist Association.&amp;rdquo;

== Relationship to the Unitarian Universalist Association ==

Up until July 2002, almost all member congregations of CUC were also members of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA). In the past, most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, with an agreement in 2001 between the UUA and CUC, from July 2002 onwards most services have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations.

The UUA continues to provide services relating to ministerial settlement, youth (14-20) and young adult(18-35) programming.

== Unitarians and Universalists ==

While the name of the organisation is the '''Canadian Unitarian Council''', the CUC includes Unitarian, Universalist, Unitarian Univeralist and Universalist Unitarian congregations as its members.  Changing the name has occasionally been debated, but there have been no successful motions.  To recognise the diversity, the abbreviation is often written as U*U (and playfully read as &quot;You star, you&quot;).

'''Charles Mingus''' ([[April 22]], [[1922]] &amp;ndash; [[January 5]], [[1979]]), also known as '''Charlie Mingus''', was an American  [[jazz]] [[double bass|bassist]], [[composer]], [[bandleader]], and occasional [[pianist]]. He was also known for his [[activism]] against [[racism|racial injustice]]. 

Mingus's legacy is notable: he is ranked among the finest composers and performers in jazz, and recorded many highly regarded albums. Dozens of musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. His songs &amp;mdash; though melodic and distinctive &amp;mdash; are not often recorded by later musicians, due in part to their unconventional nature. Mingus was also influential and creative as a bandleader, recruiting talented and sometimes little-known artists whom he assembled into unconventional and revealing configurations.

Nearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus's often fearsome temperament. His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many onstage explosions, though it has been argued that his temper also grew from a need to vent frustration.  Ironically, a perfect show could irritate him by closing this outlet. 

Mingus was prone to [[clinical depression|depression]] (possibly [[manic depression]]). He tended to have brief periods of extreme creative activity, intermixed with fairly long periods of greatly decreased output. 

Most of Mingus's music retained the hot and soulful feel of [[hard bop]] and drew heavily from black [[gospel music]] while sometimes drawing on elements of [[Third Stream Jazz]] and [[free jazz]]. Yet Mingus avoided categorization, forging his own brand of music that fused tradition with unique and unexplored realms of jazz. Mingus focused on collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans Jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, Mingus looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. He strived to create unique music to be played by unique musicians. 

Due to his brilliant writing for mid-size ensembles &amp;mdash; and his catering to and emphasising the strengths of the musicians in his groups &amp;mdash; Mingus is often considered the heir apparent to [[Duke Ellington]], for whom he expressed unqualified admiration. 

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Mingus was born in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]], [[Arizona]], but was raised largely in the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] area of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].

His mother allowed only church-related music in their home, but Mingus developed an early love for jazz, especially Ellington's music. He studied [[trombone]], and later [[cello]]. Much of the cello technique he learned was applicable to [[double bass]] when he took up the instrument in [[high school]]. 

Even in his teen years, Mingus was writing a considerable number of rather advanced pieces; many are similar to Third Stream Jazz. A number of them were recorded in 1960 with conductor [[Gunther Schuller]], and released as ''Pre-Bird'', referencing [[Charlie Parker|Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker]].

Mingus gained a reputation as something of a bass prodigy. He toured with [[Louis Armstrong]] in 1943, then played with [[Lionel Hampton]]'s band in the late 1940s; Hampton performed and recorded a few of Mingus's pieces. A popular trio of Mingus, [[Red Norvo]] and [[Tal Farlow]] in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in the early 1950s, and Mingus's notorious temper reportedly led to his being the only musician personally fired by Ellington.

Also in the early 1950s, before attaining commercial recognition as a bandleader, he played a number of live bookings with Charlie Parker, whose compositions and improvisations greatly inspired and influenced Mingus. Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker's legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker's throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker's self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song, &quot;If Charlie Parker were a Gunslinger, There'd Be A Whole Lot of Dead Copycats.&quot;

In 1952 Mingus co-founded [[Debut Records]] with [[Max Roach]], in order to conduct his recording career as he saw fit. After bassist [[Oscar Pettiford]] broke his arm playing [[baseball]], Mingus stepped in to replace him at the famed May 15, 1953 concert at [[Massey Hall]]. He joined [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Charlie Parker, [[Bud Powell]], and Max Roach in what was to be the last recorded meeting of the two lead instrumentalists. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely-audible bass part. The two 10&quot; albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any [[royalties]] &quot;for years and years&quot; for his Massey Hall appearance. The records though, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings. 

In 1955, Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a club date billed as a &quot;reunion&quot; with Parker, [[Bud Powell|Powell]], and Roach. Powell, who had suffered from alcoholism and mental illness for years (potentially exacerbated by a severe police beating and [[electroshock]] treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell's incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting &quot;Bud Powell...Bud Powell...&quot; as if beseeching Powell's return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell's departure, to his own amusement and Mingus's exasperation. Mingus took another mic and announced to the crowd, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please don't associate me with any of this. This is not jazz. These are sick people.&quot; Roughly a week later, Parker died of complications of years of drug abuse.

===''Pithecanthropus Erectus''===
Mingus had already recorded about ten albums as a bandleader, but [[1956]] was a breakthrough year, with the release of ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'', arguably his first major work as both a bandleader and composer. Like Ellington, Mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind, and his band for ''Erectus'' included adventurous, though distinctly [[blues]]-oriented musicians, especially saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and piano player [[Mal Waldron]]. The title song is a ten minute [[tone poem]], depicting the rise of man from his [[hominid]] roots ([[Java Man|''Pithecanthropus erectus'']]) to an eventual downfall. A section of the piece was [[free improvisation|improvised]] free of structure or theme.

Another album, ''The Clown'' ([[1957]] on [[Atlantic Records]]) was the first to feature [[drum]]mer [[Dannie Richmond]].  Richmond played with Mingus for the next twenty years, until Mingus' death. Richmond and Mingus formed one of the most impressive and versatile [[rhythm section]]s in jazz. Both were accomplished performers seeking to stretch the boundaries of their music while staying true to its roots. When joined by pianist [[Jaki Byard]], they were dubbed &quot;The Almighty Three&quot;. [http://www.fantasyjazz.com/catalog/mingus_c_cat.html]

The following decade is widely regarded as Mingus's most productive and fertile era. Impressive new compositions and albums appeared at an astonishing rate: Some ''thirty'' records in ten years, for a number of record labels (Debut, [[Candid Records|Candid]], [[Impulse Records]] and others), a pace perhaps unmatched by any musician or group excepting Ellington. 

Mingus often worked with a mid-sized ensemble (around 8&amp;ndash;10 members) of rotating musicians known as the '''Jazz Workshop'''. Mingus broke new ground, constantly demanding that his musicians be able to explore and develop their perceptions on the spot. Those tapped to join the Workshop (or Sweatshops as they were colorfully dubbed by the musicians) were skilled musicians yearning for a taste of the big time. Mingus shaped these promising novices into a cohesive [[improvisation]]al machine that in many ways anticipated [[free jazz]]. 

Jazz Workshop members included:
*[[Pepper Adams]]
*[[Jaki Byard]]
*[[Eric Dolphy]]
*[[Booker Ervin]]
*[[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]
*[[Jimmy Knepper]]
*[[John Handy]]
*[[Jackie McLean]]
*[[Charles McPherson (saxophonist)|Charles McPherson]]
*[[Horace Parlan]]

Only one misstep occurred in this era: [[1962]]'s ''Town Hall Concert''. An ambitious program, it was unfortunately plagued with troubles from its inception. [http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0023/santoro.php]  Mingus' vision was finally realized in [[1989]], see [[Epitaph (Mingus)]].

===''Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus''===
Mingus witnessed [[Ornette Coleman]]'s legendary &amp;mdash; and controversial &amp;ndash; 1960 appearances at [[New York City]]'s [[Five Spot]] jazz club. Though he initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman's innovative music, Mingus was in fact a prime influence of the early [[free jazz]] era. He formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter [[Ted Curson]] and saxophonist [[Eric Dolphy]]. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman's quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. ''Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus'', the quartet's sole album, is frequently included among the finest in Mingus's catalogue.

===''The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady''===
In [[1963]], Mingus released ''[[The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady]]'', a sprawling, multi-section masterpiece, described as &quot;one of the greatest achievements in [[orchestration]] by any composer in jazz history.&quot; [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=UIDSUB040405070932540817&amp;sql=A4f867ur070jd] The album was also unique in that Mingus asked his [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] to provide notes for the record. 

1963 also saw the release of an unaccompanied album ''Mingus Plays Piano''. His piano technique, though capable and expressive, was somewhat unrefined when compared to  [[Ahmad Jamal]] or other contemporary jazz pianists, but the album is still generally well regarded. A few pieces were entirely improvised and drew on [[European classical music|classical music]] as much as jazz, preceding [[Keith Jarrett]]'s landmark ''[[The Köln Concert]]'' in those regards by some twelve years.

In [[1964]] Mingus put together one of his best-known groups, a sextet including Dannie Richmond, [[Jaki Byard]], Eric Dolphy, [[trumpet]]er [[Johnny Coles]], and tenor saxophonist [[Clifford Jordan]].  The group was recorded frequently during its short existence; Coles fell ill during a European tour.

===''Changes''===
Mingus's pace slowed somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In [[1974]] he formed a quintet with Richmond, pianist [[Don Pullen]], trumpeter [[Jack Walrath]] and saxophonist [[George Adams]]. They recorded two well-received albums, &quot;[[Changes One (Mingus)|Changes One]]&quot; and &quot;[[Changes Two]]&quot;.

''Cumbia and Jazz Fusion'' in [[1976]] sought to blend [[Colombia]]n music (the &quot;[[Cumbia]]&quot; of the title) with more traditional jazz forms.

===Later career and demise===
By the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (popularly known as [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease), a wastage of the musculature. His once formidable bass technique suffered, until he could no longer play the instrument. He continued composing, however, and supervised a number of recordings before his death. 

Mingus died aged 56 in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the [[Ganges River]].

At the time of his death, Mingus had been recording an album with singer [[Joni Mitchell]], which included vocal versions of some of his songs (including &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;) among Mitchell originals and short, spoken word duets and home recordings of Mitchell and Mingus. To show how important his influence was on the jazz world, this album also featured [[Jaco Pastorius]], a similarly self-destructive bassist.

===After his death===
The music of Charles Mingus is currently being performed and reinterpreted by the [[Mingus Big Band]], which plays every Tuesday and Thursday in New York City, and often tours the rest of the [[United States]] and Europe. [[Elvis Costello]] has written lyrics for a few Mingus pieces and has sung them in performances with the Mingus Big Band.  Other tribute bands are also active around the US, including [[Mingus Amungus]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Bass players continue to revere Mingus and his work, as exemplified by Pat Kays, the bassist of [[third-wave ska]] band [[Catch 22 (band)|Catch 22]]. Kays took the name Mingus as his nickname.

A documentary film by Ray Davies entitled ''Weird Nightmare'' was released in [[1991]].  It contains footage of Mingus and interviews with artists making [[Hal Willner]]'s tribute album of the same name, including Elvis Costello, [[Charlie Watts]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Vernon Reid]].

===Mingus's temper===
As respected as Mingus was for his musical talents, he was often feared for his sometimes violent onstage temper, which was at times directed at members of his band, and other times aimed at the audience. He was physically large, prone to [[obesity]] (especially in his later years), and was by all accounts often intimidating and frightening when expressing anger or displeasure.

When confronted with a nightclub audience talking and clinking ice in their glasses while he performed, Mingus stopped his band and loudly chastised the audience, stating &quot;[[Isaac Stern]] doesn't have to put up with this shit&quot; [http://www.swing2bop.com/articles.html]. He once played a prank on a similar group of nightclub chatterers by silencing his band for several seconds, allowing the loud audience members to be clearly heard, then continuing as the rest of the audience snickered at the oblivious 'soloists'. 

While onstage at a memorial concert in Philadelphia, he reportedly attempted to crush his pianist's hands with the instrument's keyboard cover, then punched trombonist [[Jimmy Knepper]] in the mouth. [http://www.mp3.com/charles-mingus/artists/6068/biography.html]  On [[October 12]], [[1962]], Mingus reportedly punched Knepper while the two men were working together at Mingus's apartment on a score for his upcoming concert at New York Town Hall and Knepper refused to take on more work.  The blow broke one of Knepper's teeth, ruined his embouchure and resulted in the permanent loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone.  This attack ended their working relationship and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert, a disaster.  Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January, 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. [http://www.jazznation.com/Goodbye.htm]  In another incident, saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] once stabbed Mingus after Mingus punched him, fearing the bassist was about to kill him.

Mingus' onstage destruction of an $800 bass prompted British rockers [[The Animals]] &amp;mdash; avid fans who witnessed Mingus's characteristic explosion at a London show &amp;mdash; to emulate the outburst, starting a trend of rampant  onstage destruction of musical equipment in &quot;rock theater&quot; popularized by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Who]], which continues to this day.

===Epitaph===
&quot;[[Epitaph (Mingus)|Epitaph]]&quot; is the master work of Charles Mingus. It is a composition which is more than 4,000 measures long, requires two hours to perform and was only completely discovered during the cataloguing process after his death by musicologist Andrew Homzy. With the help of a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]]. This concert was produced by Mingus' widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, ten years after his death.

==Cover versions==
Considering the number of compositions that Charles Mingus has written, his works have not been recorded as often as comparable jazz composers. Of all his works, his elegant [[elegy]] for [[Lester Young]], &quot;Goodbye Porkpie Hat&quot; (from ''Mingus Ah Um'') has probably had the most recordings. Besides recordings from the expected jazz artists, the song has also been recorded by musicians as disparate as [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], and [[Bert Jansch]] and [[John Renbourn]] with and without [[Pentangle]]. [[Joni Mitchell]] sang a version with lyrics that she wrote for the song.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CODATA''' ('''Committee on Data for Science and Technology''') was established in [[1966]] as an interdisciplinary committee of the [[International Council of Science]] (ICSU), formerly the International Council of Scientific Unions. It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of data of importance to [[science]] and [[technology]].

The CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants was established in [[1969]]. Its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the fundamental [[physical constant]]s and closely related [[conversion factor]]s for use worldwide. The first such CODATA set was published in 1973, the second in 1986, the third in 1998, and the fourth in 2002.

The CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants are published at the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.

      <comment>/* Notable Animated Films directed by Chuck Jones */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles Martin &quot;Chuck&quot; Jones''' ([[September 21]], [[1912]]&amp;ndash;[[February 22]], [[2002]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[animator]], [[cartoon artist]], [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]], and [[film director|director]] of [[animation|animated]] films, most memorably of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts for the [[Warner Brothers]] [[Termite Terrace|cartoon studio]]. He directed many of the classic short [[animated cartoon]]s starring [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], the [[Road Runner]] &amp; [[Wile E. Coyote]], [[Pepé Le Pew]] and the other Warners characters, including the memorable ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'' ([[1957]]) and ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' ([[1952]]) (both later inducted into the [[National Film Registry]]), establishing himself as an important innovator and storyteller.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jones was born in [[Spokane, Washington]], and later moved with his parents and three siblings to the [[Los Angeles, California]] area. In his autobiography, ''Chuck Amuck'', Jones credits his artistic bent to circumstances surrounding his father, who was an unsuccessful businessman in California in the [[1920s]].  His father, Jones recounts, would start every new business venture by purchasing new stationery and new pencils with the company name on them.  When the business failed, his father would turn the useless stationery and pencils over to his children.  Armed with an endless supply of high-quality paper and pencils, the children drew constantly.  Jones and several of his siblings went on to artistic careers. After graduating from [[Chouinard Art Institute]], Jones held a number of low-ranking jobs in the animation industry, including washing cels at the [[Ub Iwerks]] studio and assistant animating at the [[Walter Lantz]] studio. While at Iwerks, he met a cel painter named Dorothy Webster, who would later become his wife.

===Warner Bros.===

Jones joined [[Leon Schlesinger | Leon Schlesinger Productions]], the independent studio that produced ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]], in [[1933]] as an assistant animator. During the late 1930s, he worked under directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]], becoming a director (or &quot;supervisor&quot;, the original title for an animation director in the studio) himself in [[1938]] when [[Frank Tashlin]] left the studio. Jones' first cartoon was ''[[The Night Watchman]]'', which featured a cute kitten who would later evolve into [[Sniffles]] the mouse.

Many of Jones' cartoons of the [[1930s]] and early [[1940s]] were lavishly animated, but audiences and fellow [[Termite Terrace]] staff members found them lacking in genuine humor.  Often slow-moving and overbearing with &quot;cuteness&quot;, Jones' early cartoons were an attempt to follow in the footsteps of [[Walt Disney]]'s shorts (especially with such cartoons as ''[[Tom Thumb in Trouble]]'' and the [[Sniffles]] cartoons). Jones finally broke away from both his traditional cuteness, and traditional animation conventions as well, with the cartoon ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' in [[1942]].  Jones credits this cartoon as the film where he &quot;learned how to be funny.&quot;  ''The Dover Boys'' is also one of the first uses of [[limited animation|Stylized animation]] in American film, breaking away from the more realistic animation styles influenced by the [[Walt Disney Studio|Disney Studio]]. This was also the period where Jones created many of his lesser-known characters, including [[Charlie Dog]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], and [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|The Three Bears]]. Despite their relative obscurity today, the shorts starring these characters represent some of Jones' earliest work that was strictly intended to be ''funny''.

During the [[World War II]] years, Jones worked closely with [[Theodore Geisel]] (a.k.a. [[Dr. Seuss]]) to create the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' series of Army educational cartoons. Private Snafu comically educated soldiers on topics like spies and laziness in a more risque way than general audiences would have been used to at the time. Jones would later collaborate with Seuss on a number of adaptations of Seuss' books to animated form, most importantly ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in [[1966]].

[[Image:Whats Opera Doc still.png|thumb|A still from ''What's Opera, Doc?''.]]
Jones hit his stride in the late 1940s, and continued to make his best-regarded works through the 1950s. Jones-created characters from this period includes [[Claude Cat]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]], [[Charlie Dog]], [[Michigan J. Frog]] and his three most popular creations, [[Pepe LePew]], the [[Road Runner]] and [[Wile E. Coyote]]. The Road Runner cartoons, in addition to the cartoons that are considered his masterpieces (all written and conceived by [[Michael Maltese]]), ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'', and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'' are today hailed by critics as some of the best cartoons ever made.

The staff of the Jones unit was as important to the success of these cartoons as Jones himself. Key members included writer [[Michael Maltese]], layout artist/background designer/co-director [[Maurice Noble]], animator and co-director [[Abe Levitow]], and animator [[Ken Harris]].

Jones remained at Warners throughout the [[1950s]], except for a brief period in [[1953]] when Warners closed the animation studio. During this interim, Jones found employment at the [[Walt Disney studio]], where he did four months of uncredited work on ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' ([[1959]]).

In the early [[1960s]], Jones and his wife Dorothy wrote the [[screenplay]] for the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]''. the finished film would feature the voices of [[Judy Garland]], [[Robert Goulet]] and [[Red Buttons]] as [[cat]]s in [[Paris, France]]. The feature was produced by [[UPA]], and Jones moonlit to work on the film, since he had an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. [[UPA]] completed the film and made it available for distribution in [[1962]]; it was picked up by [[Warner Bros]], who found out Jones had violated his contract and fired him from the company.

===Jones on his own===

With business partner [[Les Goldman]], Jones started an independent animation studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions, bringing on most of his unit from Warner Bros, including [[Maurice Noble]] and [[Michael Maltese]]. In [[1963]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contracted with Sib Tower 12 to have Jones and his staff produce new ''[[Tom and Jerry (MGM) | Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons. His animated short film ''[[The Dot and the Line|The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Higher Mathematics]]'' won the [[1965]] [[Academy_award|Oscar]] for Best Animated Short.

As the ''Tom and Jerry'' series wound down (it would be discontinued in [[1967]]), Jones moved on to television. In [[1966]], produced and directed the TV special ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'', featuring the voice (and facial features) of [[Boris Karloff]]. In [[1967]], Sib Tower 12 was absorbed by MGM and was renamed MGM Animation Visual Arts. Jones continued to work on TV specials such as ''[[Horton Hears A Who!]]'' ([[1970]]), but his main focus during this time was the feature film ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', which did lukewarm business when [[MGM]] released it in [[1970]].

In the [[1970s]], Jones left MGM started a new production company, Chuck Jones Productions. His most notable work during this period was three animated TV adaptations of short stories from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]]: ''[[Mowgli]]'s Brothers'', ''The White Seal'' and ''[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]''.

===Later years===

Like many modern cartoon legends, Chuck Jones never retired: he was an active artist and cartoonist up until his last weeks.  Through the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] (and until 2002) Jones was painting cartoon and parody art, sold through animation galleries by his daughter's company, Linda Jones Enterprises.  He was also creating new cartoons for the [[Internet]] based on his new character, &quot;Thomas Timberwolf&quot;. Jones also directed the animated sequence seen at the start of the [[1993]] [[film]] ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]''.  Jones was not a fan of much contemporary animation, terming most of it, especially [[television]] cartoons such as those of [[Hanna-Barbera]], &quot;[[illustrated radio]].&quot;

Jones' intellectualism, writing ability, and capacity for self-analysis made him an historical authority as well as a major contributor to the development of the animation genre throughout the 20th century.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Chuck Jones has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7011 Hollywood Blvd.

Chuck Jones died of [[congestive heart failure]] on [[February 22]] [[2002]], at age 89. Jones' death brought down the final curtain on ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' family of creators. [[Mel Blanc]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Tex Avery]], [[Bob Clampett]] and [[Carl W. Stalling]] had all died by the time Jones passed away.

==Influence and critical perception==		

Jones is considered by many to be a master of characterization and timing. His best works are noted for depicting a refinement of character to the point that a single eyebrow wiggle could be a major gag as opposed to the wild, frenetic style usually associated with cartoons, and those of Warner Bros. in particular. Like Walt Disney, Jones wanted animation to gain respect from the film and art communities, and often undertook special animation projects reflecting such, including ''What's Opera Doc'', ''The Dot and the Line'', and the [[1944]] political film ''Hell-Bent for Re-Election'', a [[election campaign|campaign]] film for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] that he directed for UPA.

In his later years, Jones became the most vocal alumnus of the Termite Terrace studio, frequently giving lectures, seminars, and working to educate newcomers in the animation field. Many of his principles, therefore, found their way back into the mainstream animation consciousness, and can be seen in films such as ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' and ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]''.

Jones had a penchant for cuteness in his earliest days as is visible in his cartoons featuring [[Sniffles]] the Mouse. Other Warners directors, particularly [[Tex Avery]] and [[Robert Clampett]], considered &quot;cute&quot; to be a [[four letter word]]. By request of producer Leon Schlesinger, Jones changed his style, and began making zanier pictures such as ''[[Wackiki Wabbit]]'' and ''Hare Conditioned''. After Avery, Clampett, and Schlesinger left the studio, Jones gradually reincorporated elements of the slow pace, sentimentality and cuteness of his previous work with characters like [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]] and the young [[Ralph Phillips]]. His versions of the characters he worked with often showcased a more infantile look than other interpretations, with larger eyes and eyelashes. This is especially apparent in his ''Tom and Jerry'' films, some of which are considered the weakest in the canon.

Jones, like the rest of his Termite Terrace associates after the departure of Schlesinger, has been criticized for using repetitive plots, most obvious in the [[Pepe Le Pew]] and [[Road Runner]] cartoons. It must be noted, however, that many of these films were originally issued to theatres years apart, and the repetitious factor was often done at the request of the producers, management, or theatre owners. Also, series like the Road Runner were set up as exercises in exploring the same situation in different ways. Jones had a set list of rules as to what could and could not occur in a Road Runner cartoon, and stated that it was not ''what'' happened that was important in the films, but ''how'' it happened.

Chuck Jones' reinvention of certain characters is also a controversial subject. He reimagined the wacky, Clampett-esque hero [[Daffy Duck]] as a greedy, sneaky [[antagonist]] with a slow-burning temper; and he relegated hapless star [[Porky Pig]] to being a [[sidekick]] or audience-aware observer of the action. Jones also created a series of films in which he used [[Friz Freleng]]'s [[Sylvester]] in the context of a real [[cat]]. Like all the Warners directors, his [[Bugs Bunny]] characterization is unique to his films: Jones' Bugs never attacks unless attacked, unlike Avery's and Clampett's bombastic rabbits.

The term '''costume''' can refer to [[wardrobe]] and [[dress]] in general, or to the distinctive style of dress of a particular people, class, or period. It can also refer to the artistic arrangement of accessories in a [[picture]], [[statue]], [[poem]], or [[play]], appropriate to the time, place, or other circumstances represented or described, or to a particular style of [[clothing]] worn to portray the wearer as a [[fictional character|character]] or type of character other than their regular persona at a social event such as a [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]], a [[fancy dress party]] or in an artistic [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]].
[[Image:Operettenkostüme1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Costumes for the ballroom (about 1850)]]


[[Theatrical costumes]], in combination with other aspects, serve to portray characters' age, [[gender role]], [[profession]], [[social class]], [[personality]], and can even reveal information about the historical period/era, geographic location, time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Sometimes theatrical costumes literally mimic what the costume designer thinks the character would wear if the character actually existed. On the other hand, often stylized theatrical costumes can exaggerate some aspect of a character.  Without [[theatrical costumers]], the audience would be left wondering who is related to whom, and which person is which.  Costuming, truly is as important as the set and  the script, yet most audiences take it for granted.

[[National costume]] or regional costume can express local (or [[exile]]d) [[identity]] and emphasise uniqueness.  It is often a source of one's National pride.  Think [[Scotsman]] in a [[kilt]] or Japanese in a [[kimono]].

The wearing of costumes has become an important part of [[Mardi Gras]] and [[Halloween]] celebrations, and (to a lesser extent) people may also wear costumes in conjunction with other [[holiday]] celebrations, such as [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. Mardi Gras costumes are usually [[Court jester|jesters]] and other fantasy characters, while Halloween costumes traditionally take the form of [[supernatural]] creatures such as [[ghosts]], [[vampires]], and [[angels]].  Christmas and Easter costumes typically portray mythical holiday characters, such as [[Santa Claus]]  by donning a [[santa suit]] and [[beard]] or play the [[Easter Bunny]] by putting on a furry costume and head.   Costumes may serve to portray various other character themes during secular holidays, such as an [[Uncle Sam]] costume worn on the [[Independence Day (US)|Independence day]] for example.

One of the more prominent places people see costumes is in theatre, film and TV.  Another very popular place for costumes is sporting events and college games  Those costumes are called [[mascots]].  These team mascots hep the club or team rally around their own teams cause.

Corporations and charities create brand identities by including a [[mascot costume]] in with their advertising campaigns.  Think of the [[Kool Aid Man]] or the [[Fruit of the Loom Guys]].  The comsumer identifies with the character and this helps tie all of the adverising campaign together.

Costumes are often worn with [[make-up]] or [[wigs]] to enhance the illusion.

[[Image:Cable_Car.jpg|thumb|right|Cable Car in San Francisco]]
[[Image:Sf_cable_car.jpg|thumb|right|A San Francisco cable car]]
A '''cable car''' or '''cable railway''' is a [[mass transit]] system using rail cars that are propelled by a continuously moving cable running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are sometimes confused with [[funicular]]s, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable.

==Operation==
The cable is itself powered by a stationary motor or engine situated in a cable house or power house. The speed at which it moves is relatively constant, although affected by the current load.  

The cable car begins moving when a clamping device, called a ''grip'', is connected to the moving cable. Conversely the car is stopped by detaching it from the cable and applying the brakes. This gripping and ungripping action may be manual, as was the case in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated [[people mover]] type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the [[passenger]]s.

In the case of manual systems, the grip resembles a very large pair of [[pliers]], and considerable strength and skill are required to operate the car.  As many early cable car operators discovered the hard way, if the grip is not applied properly, it can damage the cable, or even worse, become entangled in the cable.  In the latter case, the cable car may not be able to stop and can wreak havoc along its route until the cable house realizes what is going on and halts the cable.

One claimed advantage of the cable car is its relative energy efficiency, because of the economy of centrally-located power stations, and the ability for cars going down hill to transfer energy to cars going up. However this advantage is not unique to cable cars, as electric cars fitted with [[regenerative braking]] offer the same advantages, and in any case they must be offset against the cost of moving the cable.

Because of the constant and relatively low speed, cable cars can be underestimated in an accident. Even with a cable car traveling at only 9 miles per hour, the mass of the cable car and the combined strength of the cables, can do quite a lot of harm to pedestrians if hit.

== History ==
Though there may have been earlier attempts to pull cars by endless ropes, the first cable car installation in operation was the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway]] in [[New York]], which ran from [[1 July]] [[1868]] to [[1870]]. The cable technology used in this elevated railway involved collar-equipped cables and claw-equipped cars, and proved cumbersome. The line was closed and rebuilt, and reopened with [[steam locomotives]].

[[image:Cable_Car_Station.jpg|thumb|right|Machinery driving the San Francisco Cable Car]]
The first cable cars to use grips were those of the [[Clay Street Hill Railroad]], which later became part of the [[San Francisco cable car system]]. This building of this line was promoted by [[Andrew Smith Hallidie]] with design work by [[William Eppelsheimer]], and it was first tested in [[1873]]. The success of these grips ensured that this line became the model for other cable car transit systems, and this model is often known as the ''Hallidie Cable Car''. 

In [[1881]] the [[Dunedin cable tramway system]] opened in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]] and became the first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, [[George Smith Duncan]] further developed the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too steep to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco. 

Cable cars rapidly spread to other cities, although the major attraction for most was the ability to displace [[horse]]-drawn (or other animal-drawn) systems rather than the ability to climb hills. Many people at the time viewed horse-drawn transit as unnecessarily cruel, and the fact that a typical horse could work only four or five hours per day necessitated the maintenance of large stables of draft animals that had to be fed (typically 30 lb (14 kg) of feed each day), housed, groomed, medicated and rested. Thus for a period economics worked in favour of cable cars even in relatively flat cities.

For example, the [[Chicago City Railway]], also designed by Eppelsheimer, opened in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in [[1882]] and went on to become the largest and most profitable cable car system. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of grades but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities did, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like San Francisco's ''California Cars'', Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers. 

In [[1883]] the [[New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway]] was opened, which had a most curious feature: though it was a cable car system, it used [[steam locomotive]]s to get the cars into and out of the terminals. After [[1896]] the system changed to one where a motor car was added to each train to manoeuvre at the terminals, while en route the trains were still propelled by the cable.

On [[25 September]] [[1883]] a test of a cable car system was held by [[Liverpool United]] in [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale]]. This was the first cable car system in Europe, but Liverpool United decided against implementing it. Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the [[Glasgow Subway | Glasgow District Subway]], the first underground cable car system, in [[1896]].  ([[London]]'s first deep-level tube railway, the [[City &amp; South London Railway]], had earlier also been built for cable haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in [[1890]].) A few more cable car systems were built in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]], but European cities, having much more curves in their streets, were less suitable for cable cars than American cities.

Though some new cable car systems were still being built, by [[1890]] the cheaper to construct and simpler to operate [[electricity|electrically]]-powered [[trolley]] or tram started to become the norm, and eventually started to replace existing cable car systems. For a while hybrid cable/electric systems operated, for example in Chicago where electric cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the loop area, due to the lack of trolley wires there. Eventually, San Francisco became the only street-running manually-operated system to survive -  Dunedin, the second city with such cars, was also the second-last city to operate them, closing down in [[1957]].

In the last decades of the 20th century cable cars have seen a limited revival as automatic [[people mover]]s.  They are completely computer controlled and can be switched easily from one continuous loop to another.  They are normally used in resort areas, airports and huge hospital centers.  The biggest manufacturer is Poma-Otis, a company formed by the merger of the cable car interests of the POMA ski lift company and the Otis elevator company - they can almost be considered to be horizontal elevators. Most of these cable car systems operate above ground on supported guideways, but some have sections that go underground.

== Relation to Funiculars == &lt;!-- Do not make this section about funiculars --&gt;
A cable car is superficially very similar to a [[funicular]] but differs from such a system in that its cars are not permanently attached to the cable and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has cars that are permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a single cable, making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.

A few funicular railways operate in street traffic, and because of this operation are often incorrectly described a cable cars. Examples of such operation, and the consequent confusion, are:

* The [[Great Orme Tramway]] in [[Llandudno]], [[Wales]].
* Several street funiculars in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

Even more confusingly, a hybrid cable car/funicular line once existed in the form of the original [[Wellington Cable Car]], in the [[New Zealand]] city of [[Wellington]]. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in [[1979]] and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.

== Cities currently operating cable cars ==
&lt;!-- Please do not add funiculars here--&gt;

The best known existing cable car system is the [[San Francisco cable car system]] in the [[California|Californian]] city of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. This is the oldest and biggest cable car system in permanent operation, and it is the only system to still operate in the traditional manner with manually operated cars running in street traffic.

Some other cities have modern form of cable cars, but they are often referred as [[People mover|people movers]]. The following list is not complete, but shows the best known systems:

* [[Laon]], France has a completely automatic Poma-Otis cable car system, called [[Poma 2000]]
* [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], has three lines build with this systems, linking some hotels

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creaky voice''' (also called '''laryngealisation''' or, in [[singing]], '''vocal fry''' or '''glottal fry'''), is a special kind of [[phonation]] in which the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s in the [[larynx]] are drawn together; as a result, the [[vocal folds]] are compressed rather tightly, becoming relatively slack and compact, and forming a large, irregularly vibrating mass. The frequency of the vibration is very low (20&amp;ndash;50 pulses per second, about two octaves below normal voice) and the airflow through the [[glottis]] is very slow. A slight degree of laryngealisation, occurring e.g. in some [[Korean language|Korean]] consonants is called &quot;[[stiff voice]]&quot;.

There is some argument among music instructors as to whether or not this is an actual register as it can be used to add a raspy sound to other registers. By putting less amount of air on the cords than is needed for a clear tone of the pitch you are going for, the tone breaks up and becomes a rasp. Many [[Heavy Metal]] singers use this technique to create a screaming sound. One example is [[Chester Bennington]] of [[Linkin Park]].

The [[Danish language|Danish]] [[prosody|prosodic]] feature ''[[stød]]'' is an example of a form of laryngealisation that has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] function.

Creaky voice manifests itself in the [[idiolect]]s of some [[American English]] speakers, particularly at the beginnings of sentences that the speaker wishes to &quot;soft-pedal&quot;.  The &quot;eh&quot; of &quot;Eh, I don't know about that.&quot; is frequently pronounced in creaky voice.  This phenomenon is more prominent among female American English speakers than among male speakers.

It can also occur accidentally when the speaker's throat is tired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:monitor.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nineteen inch (48 cm) CRT computer monitor]]
A '''computer display''', '''monitor''' or '''screen''' is a [[computer peripheral]] device capable of showing characters and/or still or moving images generated by a computer and processed by a [[graphics card]]. Monitors generally conform to one or more [[computer display standard|display standards]]. Sometimes the name &quot;display&quot; suits better than the word &quot;monitor&quot;, as the latter term can also ambiguously refer to a &quot;machine-level [[debugger]]&quot; or to a &quot;[[thread]] synchronization mechanism&quot;. Some people also refer to computer displays as &quot;heads&quot;, especially when talking about multiple displays connected to a single physical computer. Once an essential component of a [[computer terminal]], computer displays have long since become standardized peripherals in their own right.

==Hardware ==
===Technologies===
As with [[television]], several different [[hardware]] technologies exist for displaying computer-generated output:

* [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT)
* [[Liquid crystal display]] (LCD). [LCD-based monitors can receive television and computer protocols ([[SVGA]],  [[PAL]], [[SECAM]]; [[NTSC]]).)
* [[Plasma display]] 
* [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display]] (SED)
* [[Video projector]]

A modern CRT display has considerable flexibility: it can usually handle a range of [[Display resolution|resolution]]s from 320 by 200 [[pixel]]s (320×200) up to 2048 by 1536 pixels (2048×1536) or 2304 by 1440 pixels (2304×1440), with unlimited colours and a variety of [[refresh rate]]s.

As of 2005, the highest known maximum native resolution for any type of monitor is 3840 by 2400 pixels (3840×2400) on an LCD screen.

[[Dot pitch]] measures the sharpness of a display.  In general, the lower the dot pitch, (e.g. .24), the sharper the picture will appear.

Early CRT-based VDUs (Visual Display Units) without [[computer graphics|graphics]] capabilities gained the label &quot;glass [[teletype]]s&quot;, because of the functional similarity to their electromechanical predecessors.

Black-and-white displays can only display one colour: either as on or off. Monochrome displays can show only levels of a single colour. In both cases the display usually uses [[green screen|green]], orange (amber) or gray (white).

[[Image:Monitor.jpg|thumb|computer monitor]]
Colour monitors may show either digital colour (turning each of the red, green and blue signals either on or off, giving eight possible colours: black, white, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow - sometimes with an extra &quot;brightness&quot; signal producing a total of up to 16 colours) or analog colour (red, green and blue signals vary continuously, allowing the display of any combination). Early digital monitors are sometimes known as TTLs because the voltages on the red, green and blue inputs are compatible with [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] logic chips. Later digital monitors support [[LVDS]], or [[TMDS]] protocols.

Most modern [[computer]] displays can show thousands or millions of different colours in the [[RGB colour space]] by combining red, green, and blue dots in varying intensities.

With exceptions of [[DLP]], most display technologies (especially LCD) have an inherent misregistration of the colour planes, that is, the centers of the red, green, and blue dots do not line up perfectly.  [[Subpixel rendering]] depends on this misalignment; technologies making use of this include the [[Apple II]] from [[1976]] [http://grc.com/ctwho.htm], and more recently [[Microsoft]] ([[ClearType]], [[1998]]) and [[XFree86]] ([[X Rendering Extension]]).

Moving texts can appear in italics, even when the display resolution is too low to show static italics: a fractional time delay causes an apparent corresponding shift of a fraction of a [[pixel]].

Note the sometimes disputed issue of [[screen emissions]].  Most computer monitors have [[analog video|analog]] signal relay, but some (mostly LCD screens) start supporting digital input signals.  It is a common misconception that all computer monitors are digital.  For several years, [[Televisions]], [[composite monitor]]s and computer displays have had significant distinction, however it has blurred as newer TVs have become versatile to accommodate these purposes.

===History===
A trend of [[miniaturization]] within computer displays has seen a general move away from the older, bulky CRT devices in the general direction of [[flat screen]]s as found in modern [[laptop]]s.

===Major manufacturers===
*[[Apple Computer]]
*[[BenQ]]
*[[Dell, Inc.]]
*[[Eizo]]
*[[Iiyama Corporation]]
*[[LaCie]]
*[[LG Electronics]]
*[[NEC/Mitsubishi]]
*[[Philips Electronics|Philips]]
*[[Samsung]]
*[[Sony]]
*[[ViewSonic]]

==Configuration and usage==

===Multi-head===
{{main|Multi monitor}}
Some users use more than one monitor. The displays can operate in multiple modes. One of the most common spreads the entire desktop over all of the monitors, which thus act as one big desktop. The [[X Window System]] refers to this as &quot;[[Xinerama]]&quot;. 

A monitor may also clone another monitor. 

Terminology:
* Dualhead - Using two monitors 
* Triplehead - using three monitors
* Display assembly - multi-head configurations actively managed as a single unit

===Virtual displays===
The X Window System provides configuration mechanisms for using a single hardware monitor for rendering multiple virtual displays, as controlled (for example) with the Unix DISPLAY [[global variable]] or with the -display command option.

      <comment>/* How ClearType works */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;nowiki&gt;ClearType&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' is a registered trademark for a technology developed by [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] to improve the appearance of text on certain types of [[computer]] [[display]] screens, especially [[flat panel|flat-panel]] displays.

This article is a general explanation of ClearType for non-specialists.  For a detailed technical treatment of ClearType and related technologies, and the mathematical principles upon which they are based, see [[Subpixel rendering]].

==Introduction==

Computer displays in which the positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the hardware&amp;mdash;such as most modern [[flat panel|flat-panel displays]]&amp;mdash;can show strong ''[[aliasing]] artifacts'' (''i.e.,'' &amp;ldquo;jaggies&amp;rdquo;) when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements such as text.  ClearType uses [[anti-aliasing]] at the subpixel level to greatly reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear &amp;ldquo;smoother&amp;rdquo; and more legible.

While the exact implementation of ClearType is specific to Microsoft, the overall principles upon which it is based have been known and used for many years in various types of display systems, such as that used by [[Apple II family|Apple II]] computers with [[NTSC]] [[television]] sets in the [[1970s]].

Like most other types of subpixel rendering, ClearType actually involves a compromise, sacrificing one aspect of image quality (color or ''[[chrominance]]'' detail) for another (light and dark or ''[[luminance]]'' detail).  The compromise works because it takes advantage of certain pecularities of [[human eye|human vision]]. 

ClearType is applied only to text that is rendered as such by user and system applications. Other graphic display elements (including text that has already been converted to [[bitmap|bitmaps]]) are not altered by ClearType.  For example, text in [[Microsoft Word]] will be rendered on the screen with ClearType enhancement, but text placed in a bitmapped image in a program such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] will not be modified.  This is important because the ClearType technology is extremely specific to text rendering on certain types of computer displays; it would not be useful and could even degrade perceived image quality if it were applied in any other circumstances.

ClearType is not used for text being printed on paper. Most printers already use such small pixels for printing that aliasing is never a problem, and in any case they don't have the fixed, addressable subpixels that ClearType requires.

Computer files that contain text are unaffected by ClearType, since ClearType is applied only when the text is actually being rendered onto the screen of a computer display.

==How ClearType works==

Normally, the software in a computer treats the computer&amp;rsquo;s display screen as a rectangular array of square, indivisible ''[[pixel|pixels]],'' each of which has an intensity and color that are determined by the blending of three [[primary color|primary colors]]: red, blue, and green. However, actual display hardware usually implements each pixels as a group of three adjacent, independent ''[[subpixel|subpixels]],'' each of which displays a different primary color. Thus, on a real computer display, each pixel is actually composed of separate red, green, and blue subpixels. For example, if a flat-panel display is examined under a magnifying glass, the pixels may appear as follows:

[[Image:Subpixels.png|center|Subpixels]]

In the illustration above, there are nine pixels, but there are 27 subpixels.

If the computer controlling the display knows the exact position and color of all the subpixels on the screen, it can take advantage of this to improve the apparent sharpness of the images on the screen in certain situations.  If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, blue, and green, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only one or two of the subpixels.  For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit.  This effectively triples the sharpness of the image at normal viewing distances; but the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes upon very close examination (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).

ClearType uses this method to improve the sharpness of text. When the elements of a type character are smaller than a full pixel, ClearType lights only the appropriate subpixels of each full pixel in order to more closely follow the outlines of the character.  Text rendered with ClearType looks &amp;ldquo;smoother&amp;rdquo; and more legible than text rendered without it, provided that the pixel layout of the display screen exactly matches what ClearType expects.

The following picture shows a 4&amp;times; enlargement of the word ''Wikipedia'' rendered using ClearType.
The word was originally rendered using a [[Times New Roman]] 12 [[Point (typography)|pt]] [[typeface|font]].

:[[Image:Wikipedia ClearType.png|center|frame|The word &quot;Wikipedia&quot; rendered using ClearType]]

In this magnified view, it becomes clear that, while the overall sharpness of the text seems to improve, there is some color fringing of the text.  At normal viewing distances, however, only the sharpness is perceptible, and the color fringing becomes invisible.

==ClearType and human vision==

ClearType and similar technologies work because human vision is much more sensitive to variations in intensity than it is to variations in color. The human eye can discern contrasts in intensity about three times better than it can discern contrasts in color; thus, when ClearType sacrifices color accuracy in order to improve the sharpness of light and dark, the overall effect&amp;mdash;as seen by human eyes&amp;mdash;is an improvement.

==Display requirements==

ClearType and allied technologies require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, the positions of the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected.  This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which the positions of the pixels are permanently fixed by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.

ClearType does not work with flat-panel displays that are operated at resolutions other than their &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; resolutions, since only the native resolution corresponds exactly to the actual positions of pixels on the screen of the display.

If a display does not have the type of fixed pixels that ClearType expects, text rendered with ClearType enabled will actually look worse than type rendered without it. Some flat panels have unusual pixel arrangements, with the colors in a different order, or with the subpixels positioned differently (in three horizontal bands, or in other ways).  ClearType needs to be manually tuned for use with such displays (see below).  Similarly, ''displays that have no fixed pixel positions, such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, are incompatible with ClearType.''

Additionally, when images are prepared to be display-independent (that is, when they are prepared for distribution, and not just for display on the computer with which they were prepared), ClearType should be turned off if rendered text is part of the image. For example, [[screenshot|screenshots]] should always be prepared with ClearType turned ''off.''  Image-editing programs such as [[Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] or [[Paint Shop Pro|Corel Paint Shop Pro]] bypass ClearType when rendering text directly, for precisely this reason.

==ClearType tuning==

Most recent versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] only allow ClearType to be turned on or off. However, there are other parameters that can be set via a tool that Microsoft makes available for free download from its site. See [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx Microsoft's ClearType Tuner PowerToy] for details.

==Illustrated Comparison==
A few illustrations can make the effect of ClearType rendering clear.

On the left, an extreme close-up of a color display shows (a) text rendered without ClearType and (b) text rendered with ClearType. Note the changes in subpixel intensity that are used to increase effective resolution when ClearType is enabled&amp;mdash;without ClearType, all pixels are completely on or completely off.

On the right, a slight magnification of normal rendered text shows the net effect of (c) rendering with ClearType enabled and (d) rendering with ClearType disabled.

A '''centriole''' in [[biology]] is a barrel shaped [[microtubule]] structure found in most [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cells]], and cells of [[fungi]] and [[algae]] though not frequently in [[plant]]s.  The walls of each centriole are usually composed of nine triplet [[microtubule]]s, although ''[[Drosophila]]'' embryos have nine doublets and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' sperm cells and early embryos and have nine singlets.  

Two centrioles are arranged perpendicularly and surrounded by further proteins (the pericentriolar material) to form the [[centrosome]].  The centrosome is also known as the [[microtubule organizing center]] (MTOC).  The MTOC plays an important role in microtuble organization in the cell.  All microtubules are anchored at their (-) end while they grow away from the MTOC in the (+) direction.  

Centrioles are important in the [[cell division]] process, organizing the [[mitotic spindle]] upon which the [[chromosomes]] are pulled apart.  Some animal cells are able to divide their [[chromosomes]] without centrioles, for instance in female [[meiosis]]. Centrioles assist the cell through the process of [[mitosis]] and in male [[meiosis]].  During cell division the centrioles are copied, so that there will be a pair for each daughter cell.  In replication, each new set of centrioles is compsed of one original centriole, and a newly made centriole.  If the centrioles are used in forming flagella or cilia, the oldest of the two centrioles becomes the main base for that structure.  This is one reason why each set of newly replicated centrioles receives one centriole from the original cell and a newly formed centriole, so that the cell will know which one to allow to form flagella or cilia.

The proteins which make up the centrioles (the proteome) of the green algae [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]] have been determined.  In chlamydomonas centrioles play an important role in the formation and movement of [[flagella]].  The centriole acts as the base of the flagella, from which nine doublets of the flagellar axoneme are templated from the original 9 triplet microtubules of that centriole.


Centrioles are structurally identical to the [[basal body]].

[[Image:Creation vs evolution debate.jpg|frame|right|''Creation Magazine'' is a publication supporting young-earth creationist beliefs. This issue examines whether [[dinosaur]]s perished in [[Noah's ark|Noah's flood]].]]

'''Creation Science''' is a carefully named [[creationist]] endeavor that holds that the events associated with the [[Bible|biblical]] account of [[creation according to Genesis|creation]] have [[scientific evidence]] and can be modeled through the [[scientific method]].  This view is rejected by [[scientific community|mainstream scientists]] who see it as [[pseudoscience]].  Creation science as an organized movement is concentrated within the [[United States]], primarily among [[Evangelical]] [[Christian]] denominations which hold to [[Biblical inerrancy]].

Advocates of Creation Science dispute the [[scientific theory]] of the [[common descent]] of all life via [[biological evolution]] and argue in favor of [[creation biology]]. They also depart from the [[uniformitarianism|uniformitarian]] model of [[geology]], in favor of [[flood geology]], arguing for the historical accuracy of the [[deluge (mythology)|global flood]] of [[Noah's ark]]. 

Creation science has no published results or field observations in mainstream [[peer review|peer reviewed]] journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. Creation science literature generally consists of compiling perceived weaknesses in current models of evolution and geology. The presentation of creationism ''qua'' [[science]] is the chief issue of the [[creation-evolution controversy]] as it does not conform to the [[scientific method]]. Some advocates have spent many years arguing for inclusion of creation science in the science curriculum of [[public education#United States Public School|U.S. public schools]].

== History and organization ==
Creationism, the belief in a created universe, was originally based purely on [[creation theology|theology]].  The vast majority of [[Church Fathers]] and [[Reformers]] accepted Genesis straightforwardly, and even the few who did not, such as [[Origen]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], defended an earth that was on the order of thousands of years old. By the [[1830s]], [[scientific evidence]] contrary to the doctrine of &quot;special creation&quot; had begun to collect. In [[1859]] [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' and by the [[1900s]] [[natural selection]] and descent with modification was widely accepted as the unifying principle of biological development. Opposition to this [[scientific consensus]] became condified as the [[creationism|creationist]] movement and has had an associated [[history of creationism|history]].

The history of Creation Science begins with certain writers who looked to studying geology within the Biblical timeframe detailed in the [[Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar]]. Such a timeframe directly contradicted that provided by geologists for the [[age of the Earth]]. Some consider the first serious Creation Science writer to be Canadian [[George McCready Price]] who wrote extensively contradicting mainstream geological understandings of timeframes and [[geologic history]].  However, Creation Science (dubbed '''Scientific Creationism''' at the time) only emerged as an organized movement during the [[1960s]] following the publication of ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by [[Henry M. Morris]] and John C. Whitcomb.

Subsequently, advocates of Creation Science have expanded their critiques into [[biology]] and [[cosmology]]. However, efforts to have it legislated to be taught in schools in the United States were eventually halted by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First amendment]] in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] 1987 [http://www.robibrad.demon.co.uk/Chapter3.htm].

Following the Edwards v. Aguillard decision, some adherents lent support to the teaching of [[intelligent design]] under its [[Intelligent design movement#Origin of the movement|'big tent' strategy]] [http://www.equip.org/free/DL303.pdf]. The allied ''[[Teach the Controversy]]'' campaign argues that intelligent design is on par with the scientific theory of evolution and therefore that both should be taught in schools as equally worthy of consideration.

Creation Science is distinguished from [[Neo-Creationism]], which is largely associated with the [[intelligent design movement]], in that most advocates of Creation Science accept scripture as a foundation for their claims and seek to validate scripture as historical fact through science as a primary a goal. Neo-Creationism eschews references to scripture altogether from its [[polemics]] and stated goals as a matter of principle (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents hope to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula. Carefully avoiding any reference to the identity of the [[intelligent designer]] as God in their arguments, intelligent design proponents believe that their movement will return a version of creationism back to science classrooms without violating the [[First Amendment]].

Today, Creation Science as an organized movement is primarily centered within the [[United States]], although Creation Science organizations are known in other countries. For example, [[Answers in Genesis]] was founded in Australia. Proponents are found primarily among various denominations of [[Christianity]] described as [[evangelicalism|evangelical]], conservative, or [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]]. While creationist movements also exist in [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]], these movements do not use the phrase ''creation science'' to describe their beliefs.

== Issues in creation science ==
Creation Science has its roots in the ongoing effort by [[Young Earth creationism|young-earth creationists]] to critique [[science|modern science]]'s description of [[natural history]] (particularly [[biological evolution]], but also [[geology]] and [[physical cosmology]]) while attempting to offer an alternative explanation of observable phenomena&amp;mdash;an explanation they also describe as &quot;science&quot;&amp;mdash;compatible with the Biblical account.

The proponents of Creation Science often argue that many observable phenomena fit more easily into the Biblical account than with the naturalistic worldview [http://www.originsresource.org/creationsci.htm] [http://www.creationism.org/heinze/Universe.htm]. The vast majority of mainstream scientists argue that this premise runs counter to the core principles of coherent [[scientific method]]ology and that literal interpretations of the Bible which demand a global flood, a young Earth, or special creation of [[created kinds]] can be shown incorrect with available [[scientific evidence]] [http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html].

Creation Science has therefore been considered by most who evaluate it [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html] to be religious, rather than scientific, because it stems from [[faith]] in the Bible, a religious book rather than by the application of the scientific method. For example, according to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), &quot;Religious opposition to evolution propels antievolutionism. Although antievolutionists pay lip service to supposed scientific problems with evolution, what motivates them to battle its teaching is apprehension over the implications of evolution for religion.&quot; [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4550_antievolutionism_and_creationi_2_13_2001.asp]. Creation science does not necessarily disagree that their oppositional stance is based on religion. [[Duane Gish]], a prominent creation science proponent, has argued that &quot;We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative processes used by the Creator.&quot; [http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/robert_l_hall/ISB1F01/ScienceInCreationScience.html].

Creation Science advocates argue that mainstream [[scientific theories]] of the origins of the universe, the earth, and life are rooted in an assumption of [[Methodology|methodological]] [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], each of which is disputed. However, in other areas of science, for example [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]] or [[medicine]], the assumptions of a naturalistic universe and uniformitarianism are not considered problematic to creation science proponents. As a matter of principle, Creation Science advocates single out the scientific theories that they have determined are most in conflict with their beliefs against which to level their philosophical critiques.

===Religious criticisms of creation science===
[[Fideism|Fideists]] criticize Creation Science on the grounds either that religious faith, alone, should be a sufficient basis for belief, or that efforts to prove the Genesis account of creation on scientific grounds are inherently futile, arguing that faith is a necessary component of divine salvation.

Since much of [[Christian theology]], including [[Liberal Christianity]], considers the [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis narrative]] to be a [[poetry|poetic]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] work rather than a literal history, many Christian churches &amp;ndash; including the [[Roman Catholic]] [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8712_message_from_the_pope_1996_1_3_2001.asp], [[Anglican]] and the more liberal denominations of the [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], [[Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterian]] faiths &amp;ndash; have either rejected creation science outright or are ambivalent to it. Supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] aruge the [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical point]] that [[Genesis]] has the style of a historical narrative and none of the earmarks of Hebrew poetry [http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v16/i1/genesis.asp].

===Scientific criticisms of creation science===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] states that ''&quot;creation science is in fact [[pseudoscience|not science]] and should not be presented as such.&quot;'' [http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html]  and that &quot;the claims of creation science lack empirical support and cannot be meaningfully tested.&quot; [http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/introduction.html]. According to [[Skeptic Magazine]], the &quot;''creation 'science' movement gains much of its strength through the use of distortion and scientifically unethical tactics''&quot; and &quot;''seriously misrepresents the theory of evolution''&quot;. &lt;!--Joyce Arthur, Published in the Skeptic, magazine of the Skeptic Society, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1996, pp. 88-93--&gt;[http://mypage.direct.ca/w/writer/gish.html].

For a [[theory]] to qualify as [[Scientific method|scientific]] it must be:
* consistent (internally and externally)
* [[Parsimony|parsimonious]] (sparing in proposed entities or explanations)
* useful (describes and explains observed phenomena)
* empirically testable and [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]]
* based upon controlled, repeatable experiments
* correctable and dynamic (changes are made as new data is discovered)
* progressive (achieves all that previous theories have and more)
* tentative (admits that it might not be correct rather than asserting certainty)

For any [[hypothesis]] or [[conjecture]] to be considered scientific, it must meet at least most, but ideally all, of the above criteria. The fewer which are matched, the less scientific it is. If it meets two or less of these criteria, it cannot be treated as scientific in any useful sense of the word.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists have considered the hypotheses proposed by creation science and have rejected them because of a lack of evidence. Furthermore, the claims of creation science do not refer to natural causes and cannot be subject to meaningful tests, so they do not qualify as scientific hypotheses. In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that creationism is religion, not science, and cannot be advocated in public school classrooms [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html]. Most major religious groups have concluded that the concept of evolution is not at odds with their descriptions of creation and human origins [http://books.nap.edu/html/creationism/preface.html].&lt;br&gt;
(NAS)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A summary of the objections to creation science by mainstream scientists:
* ''Creationism is not falsifiable'' : [[Theism]] is not falsifiable, since the existence of God is typically asserted without sufficient conditions to allow a falsifying observation. God being a transcendental being, beyond the realm of the observable, claims about his existence can neither be supported nor undermined by observation, hence making creationism, the argument from design and other arguments for the existence of God ''[[a posteriori]]'' arguments. (See also the section on [[#Creation science and falsifiability|falsifiability]] below.)
* ''Creationism violates the principle of parsimony'' : Creationism fails to pass [[Occam's razor]]. Adding supernatural entities to the equation is not strictly necessary to explain events. 
* ''Creationism is not empirically testable'' : Creationism violates a basic premise of science, [[naturalism (Philosophy)|naturalism]], so is not empirically testable. 
* ''Creationism is not based upon controlled, repeatable experiments'' : That Creationism is not based upon controlled, repeatable experiments stems not from the theory itself, but from the phenomenon that it tries to explain.
* ''Creationism is not correctable, dynamic, tentative or progressive'' : Creationism professes to adhere to an &quot;absolute Truth&quot;, &quot;the word of God&quot;, not a provisional assessment of data which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that &quot;the Truth&quot; has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data as well as any future data. It is often given as a justification for the naturalistic basis of science. In any practical sense of the concept, creationism is not progressive: it does not explain or expand upon what went before it and is not consistent with established ancillary theories.

Creationism's lack of adherence to the standards of the [[scientific method]] mean that it (and specifically creation science) cannot be said to be scientific in the way that science is conventionally understood and utilized.

&lt;!--Scientists note that creation science differs from mainstream science in that it begins with an assumption, then attempts to find evidence to support that assumption. [No, science involves this as well.] Conversely, science sets out to learn about the world through the collection of empirical evidence and the use of the scientific method.--&gt;

===Historical, philosophical, and sociological criticism of Creation Science===

Historically, the debate of whether creationism is compatible with science can be traced back to [[1874]], the year science historian [[John William Draper]] published his ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science''. In it Draper portrayed the entire history of scientific development as a war against religion. This presentation of history was propagated further by followers such as [[Andrew Dickson White]] in his essay ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom''. Their conclusions, however, have been disputed [http://www.bede.org.uk/university.htm].

Some opponents consider creation science to be an [[ideology|ideologically]] and [[politics|politically]] motivated [[propaganda]] tool, with [[cult]]-like features, to promote the creationist agenda in society.  They allege that the term &quot;creation science&quot; was chosen to purposely blur the distinction between [[science and religion]], particularly in countries which are religiously-neutral by law (such as the United States) in an attempt to gain official government sanction and recognition of their religious tenets above those of other faiths. In the United States, the principal focus of Creation Science advocates is on the government-supported [[Public school|public school system]]s, which are prohibited by the [[U.S. Constitution]] from promoting specific religions.

== Subjects within creation science ==
Subjects within creation science can be into split into three broad categories, each covering a different area of [[origins]] research: [[creationist cosmologies]], [[flood geology]] and [[creation biology]].

===Creation biology===
{{main|Creation biology}}
Creation biology centers around an idea derived from Genesis that states that life was created by God in a finite number of [[created kind]]s rather than through [[biological evolution]]. Creationists who involve themselves in this endeavor believe that observable [[speciation]] took place through inbreeding and harmful mutations during an alleged [[population bottleneck]] after the [[great flood]] of [[Noah's ark]], which they claim was an actual historical event that happened in a manner consistent with its description in the Bible. Mainstream scientists argue that there is no physical evidence for a global flood event that is consistent with the methods and standards of [[scientific evidence]] (see [[Creation science#Flood geology|below]]).

Creation biology disagrees with biological evolution (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]). Creationists contend that there is no empirical evidence that a [[speciation|new plant or animal species has ever originated]] as a result of the gradual accumulation of [[DNA]] mutations through [[natural selection]]. 

Popular arguments against evolution have changed over the years since the publishing of [[Henry M. Morris]]'s first book on the subject, ''Scientific Creationism'', but some themes remain common: [[missing links]] as an indication that evolution is incomplete; arguments based on [[entropy]], [[complexity]] and [[information theory]]; arguments claiming that natural selection is an impossible mechanism; and general criticism of the conclusions drawn from [[natural history|historical sciences]] as lacking experimental basis. The [[human evolution|origin of the human species]] is particularly hotly contested; the fossil remains of purported [[hominid]] ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving [[Homo sapiens]].

When asked what would disprove evolution in favor of creationism, biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane|J.B.S. Haldane]] replied &quot;fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era&quot;, a period more than 540 million years ago. This is an era during which evolutionists claim that life on Earth consisted largely of bacteria, algae and plankton. [[Richard Dawkins]] explains that evolution &quot;is a theory of gradual, incremental change over millions of years, which starts with something very simple and works up along slow, gradual gradients to greater complexity ... If there were a single hippo or rabbit in the Precambrian, that would completely blow evolution out of the water. None have ever been found.&quot; [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html]&lt;!--Time Magazine, [[15 August]] [[2005]], page 32--&gt;.

===Flood geology===
{{main|Flood geology}}
Flood geology is an idea based on the belief that many of Earth's geological formations were created by the global flood described in the story of Noah's ark. [[Fossil]]s and [[fossil fuels]] are believed by its followers to have formed from animal and plant matter which was buried rapidly during this flood, while submarine canyon extensions are explained as having formed during a rapid runoff from the continents after the seafloors dropped. Sedimentary strata are described as sediments predominantly laid down after Noah's flood. 

Mainstream geologists conclude that no such flood is seen in the preserved [[rock layers]] and moreover that the flood itself represents a [[physics|physical impossibility]]. For instance, since [[Mount Everest]] is approximately 5.5 miles in elevation and the Earth's surface is approximately [[Earth#Geography|200 million square miles]] in area, to cover Mount Everest to the depth of 15 [[cubits]] as indicated by [[Genesis]] 7:20 would require 1.1 billion cubic miles of water. The [[Earth's atmosphere]], however, only has the capacity to store water in vapor form sufficient to blanket the globe to a depth of [[Water vapor#Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere|25 millimeters]]. Nevertheless, there continue to be many creationists who argue that the flood can explain the [[fossil record]] and the evidence from geology and [[paleontology]] that are often used to dispute creationists' claims. In addition to the above ideas that are in opposition to the principles of [[geology]], advocates of flood geology reject [[uniformitarianism]] and the findings of [[radiometric dating]]. The [[Creation Research Society]] argues that &quot;uniformitarianism is wishful thinking&quot; [http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/notes/39/39_1/Note0206.htm].

=== Radiohaloes ===
{{main|Radiohalo}}
In the [[1970s]], young Earth creationist [[Robert V. Gentry]] proposed that radiohaloes in certain granites represented evidence for the Earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually. This idea has been criticized by mainstream physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks Gentry studies are not primordial and that the radionuclides in question need not have been the initial conditions of the rocks.

Thomas A. Baillieul, a geologist and retired senior environmental scientist with the Federal government, disputed Gentry's claims in an article entitled, &quot;&quot;Polonium Haloes&quot; Refuted: A Review of &quot;Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective&quot;&quot;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/po-halos/gentry.html].  Baillieul noted that Gentry was a physicist with no background in geology and given the absence of this background, Gentry had misrepresented geological evidence.  Additionally, he notes that Gentry relied on research from the beginning of the 20th century, long before radio isotopes were truly understood; that his assumption that a Polonium isotope cause the rings was speculative; and that Gentry falsely argues that the [[half-life]] of radioactive elements varies with time.

===Creationist cosmologies===
{{main|Creationist cosmologies}}
Several attempts have been made by creationists to construct a cosmology consistent with a young universe rather than the standard cosmological [[age of the universe]], based on the belief that Genesis describes the creation of the universe as well as the Earth. The primary challenge for young-universe cosmologies is that the accepted distances in the universe require millions or billions of years for light to travel to Earth.

Cosmology is not as widely discussed as [[creation biology]] or [[flood geology]], for several reasons.  First, many creationists, particularly [[old earth creationists]] and [[intelligent design]] creationists do not dispute that the universe may be billions of years old. Also, some creationists who believe that the Earth was created in the timeframe described in a literal interpretation of Genesis believe that Genesis describes only the creation of the ''Earth'', rather than the creation of the entire universe, allowing for both a young Earth and an old universe. Finally, the technical nature of the discipline of [[physical cosmology]] and its ties to [[mathematical physics]] prevent those without significant technical knowledge from understanding the full details of how the observations and theories behind the current models work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:cirth.png|thumb|This chart showing the runes shared by the '''''Angerthas Daeron''''' and '''''Angerthas Moria''''' is presented in Appendix E of ''[[The Return of the King (book)|The Return of the King]]''. Some of the '''''cirth''''' had different values for the [[Elvish]] and [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]] languages and some were used in only one system or the other.]]

The '''Cirth''' (&quot;''[[Runic alphabet|Runes]]''&quot;) are the letters of an [[artificial script]] which was invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] for the [[constructed language]]s he devised and used in his works.

In the fictional history of [[Middle-earth]], the original '''''Certhas Daeron''''' was created by [[Daeron]], the [[minstrel]] of king [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] and was later expanded into what was known as the '''''Angerthas Daeron'''''. Although the Cirth were later largely replaced by the [[Tengwar]] (which were enhanced and brought by [[Fëanor]]), they were adopted by [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] to write down their [[Khuzdul|Khuzdûl]] language ('''''Angerthas Moria''''' and '''''Angerthas Erebor''''') because their straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar. Some examples of Cirth writings are the inscription on [[Balin|Balin's]] tomb in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] and the inscriptions on the top of the title pages for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

''Cirth'' is plural and is written with a capital ''C'' when referring to the writing system&amp;mdash;the runes themselves can be called ''cirth''. A single rune is a ''certh''.

Many letters have shapes also found in the historical [[Futhark]] runes (used in ''[[The Hobbit]]''), but their sound values are only similar in a few of the vowels. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes (e.g. ''p'' &amp;#5832;  and ''w'' &amp;#5817; as variants of ''b'' &amp;#5842;), but is in any case much more obscure.

The Cirth are not part of the [[Unicode]] Standard. However the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]] has defined the U+E080&amp;ndash;E0FF range of the Unicode &quot;Private Use Area&quot; for Cirth.

    <title>Connection between Poles and Vandals</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Middle Ages]] and later there persisted a common false belief that the [[Vandals]] were ancestors of [[Poles]] or [[Slavic peoples]]. That belief originated probably because of two facts: first, confusion of the [[Venedes]] with Vandals and secondly, because both Venedes and Vandals in ancient times lived in areas later settled by Poles. In [[796]] in the ''Annales Alamanici'' one can find an excerpt saying ''Pipinus ... perrexit in regionem Wandalorum, et ipsi Wandali venerunt obvium'' (&quot;Pippen went to regions of Vandals and the Vandals came to meet him&quot;). In ''Annales Sangallenses'' the same raid (however put in [[795]] is summarised in one short message ''Wandali conquisiti sunt'' (&quot;Vandals were destroyed&quot;)). This means that early medieval writers gave the name of Vandals to [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]].  

Very soon after that in chronicles the name &quot;Vandal&quot; started to mean &quot;Slavs&quot; (eg. in the same ''Annales Alamanici'' about a raid of [[Charlemagne]] in the country of the [[Polabian]] Slavs: ''perrexit in regionem Wandalorum''). In [[1056]] ''Annales Augustani'' mentioned defeat of Germans with Slavic [[Lucics]] (?) as ''exercitus Saxonum a Wandalis trucidatur'' (&quot;an army of Saxons is destroyed by Vandals&quot;). In the chronicle of [[Adam of Bremen]] there is a longer sentence:

:''Sclavania igitur, amplissima Germaniae provintia, a Winulis incolitur, qui olim dicti sum Wandali; decies maior esse fertur nostra Saxonia, presertim si Boemiam et eos, qui trans Oddaram sunt, Polanos, quaia nec habitu nec lingua discrepant, in partem adiecreris Sclavaniae''

that is: &quot;Slavania (Slavic lands), the biggest from Germanic countries, is inhabited by Winnils, who were formerly called Vandals. It is supposed to be bigger than our Saxony, especially when it would include Bohemians and Polans across the Oder, since they are no different in customs and language&quot;.

In 983-993 Gerhard of Augsburg in ''Miracula Sancti Oudalrici'' (about saint Udalric) called [[Mieszko I]] ''dux Wandalorum, Misico nomine''. 

Probably the first man who directly mentioned supposedly Vandalic roots of Poland was the Polish chronicler [[Wincenty Kadlubek]] in the [[12th century]], who wrote that Poles were once called Vandals, because they live next to the river Vandalus ([[Vistula]]), and that river received its name from the mythical queen [[Vanda]] who committed suicide by drowning in it. A similar story was told by the author of ''Wielkopolska chronicle'' from the [[14th century]], and then Dzierzwa from [[Krakow]] in the [[14th century]], who tried to give Slavic etymology to all known Vandalic names, like deriving ''Vanda'' from ''węda'', that is fishing-rod. 

In [[12th century]] also Gerwazy from Tilbury, English writer in ''Otia imperialia'' wrote that citizens of Poland are called and are calling themselves Vandals. Similar thoughts gave German historian Albert Krantz ([[1450]]-[[1517]]) in ''Wandalia sive historia de Wandalorum vera origine, variis gentibus, crebris a aptria migrationibus, regnis item, etc'' where who consequently connected history of ancient Vandals and Slavs. The same was repeated by Falvio Blondi from Italy, and then [[Maciej Miechowita]] in ''Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis...'' from [[1517]].  Other arguments that Vandals were Polish ancestors were supplied by Marcin Bielski in [[15th century]]. The first Polish historian to deny any connection to Vandals and to criticise that idea was Marcin [[Kromer]], bishop of [[Warmia]], author of ''De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum'' from [[1555]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article is about the aeronautical engineer.  For Atlanta Braves outfielder Kelly Johnson, go [[Kelly Johnson (baseball)|here]].''

[[Image:Kelly-Johnson Electra.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kelly Johnson participated in the design of the [[Lockheed L-10 Electra]], testing a model of the design in the [[wind tunnel]] of the [[University of Michigan]].]]
'''Clarence Leonard &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson''' ([[February 27]], [[1910]] - [[December 21]], [[1990]]) was an [[aircraft]] [[engineer]] and [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] innovator&amp;mdash;with [[Burt Rutan]], widely considered one of the best (and certainly one of the most prolific). He worked for [[Lockheed]] for more than four decades, playing a leading role in the design of over forty aircraft.

Johnson was born in the remote mining town of [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], to immigrant Swedish parents. He designed his first aircraft, for which he won a prize, before he was thirteen. He worked his way through school, first at Flint Junior College, and then at the [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor.

Johnson, with a master's degree under his belt, joined the Lockheed Company in 1933 as a tool designer at a salary of $83 a month.  After assignments as flight test engineer, stress analyst, aerodynamicist, and weight engineer, he became chief research engineer in 1938. In 1952, Johnson was named chief engineer of Lockheed's [[Burbank, California]] plant which later became the Lockheed-California Company.  In 1956 he was chosen for the post of Vice President of Research and Development.

He became Vice President of Advanced Development Projects (ADP) in 1958.  The first ADP offices were nearly uninhabitable; the stench from a nearby plastic factory was so vile one of the engineers began answering the phone &quot;skonk works!&quot;  (Big Barnsmell's Skonk Works &amp;ndash; spelled with an &quot;o&quot; &amp;ndash; was where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed in the comic strip [[Lil Abner|&quot;L'il Abner&quot;]] by [[Al Capp]].)

His famed 'down-to-brass-tacks' management style was summed up by his motto, &quot;Be quick, be quiet, and be on time.&quot;

He joined Lockheed's board of directors in 1964 and became a senior vice president of the corporation in 1969.  He officially retired from Lockheed in 1975 but continued as a consultant at the Skunk Works. He was succeeded by [[Ben Rich]]. He left the Board of Directors in 1980. In June of 1983, the Lockheed Rye Canyon Research facility was renamed Kelly Johnson Research and Development Center, Lockheed-California Company, in his honor for 50 years of service to Lockheed.

Kelly Johnson was first married to Althea Louise Young in 1937, who died in December 1969. His second marriage was in May 1971, to MaryEllen Elberta Meade of New York, who died on [[October 13]], [[1980]], at 38 years old.  Johnson then married Nancy Powers Horrigan in November, 1980.

He wrote an [[autobiography]] titled ''Kelly: More Than My Share of it All'', ISBN 0874744911, first published in 1985.

Johnson died at the age of 80 at St Joseph Medical Center; after an illness that lasted for several years. He is buried at Forest Lawn (Hollywood Hills), Los Angeles, California.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:usaf.c130.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Lockheed C-130H Hercules''']]
The '''Lockheed C-130 Hercules''' is a four-engine [[turboprop]] [[aircraft]] that serves as the main [[Tactical airlift|tactical airlifter]] for military forces worldwide. Capable of [[landing]] and [[Take off|taking off]] from short or unprepared [[Runway|runways]], it was designed as a troop transport and [[cargo aircraft]], but is now also used for a wide variety of other roles, including [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refuelling]], [[aerial firefighting]] and [[MEDEVAC]]. More than 40 different models of the Hercules — including several [[Gunship|gunships]] — are used by more than 50 nations.

The C-130 family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. During more than 50 years of service, the family has established a solid record of reliability and durability, participating in military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations.

== Development ==
=== Origin of the Design ===
[[Image:YC-130s formation usaf.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The two YC-130 prototypes in formation. Note the blunt nose, a feature present on only the first version.]]
The [[Korean War]], which began in June, [[1950 in aviation|1950]], showed that [[World War II]]-era transports — [[C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Flying Boxcars]], [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrains]] and [[C-46 Commando|C-46 Commandos]] — were inadequate for modern warfare. Thus, on [[February 2]], [[1951 in aviation|1951]], the  [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild]], and [[Lockheed]]. The new transport, among other things, would have a capacity for 92 passengers or 64 paratroopers, a range of 1,100 nautical miles, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine stopped.

Lockheed tackled the design with a team led by [[Willis Hawkins]]. The proposal for the '''Lockheed 82''' was about 130 pages and came with a design model with a wingspan of 15 inches.{{ref|rhodes}} [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson]], who remarked when he saw the proposal, &quot;If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.&quot; These words proved unportentous: both Hibbard and Johnson signed off on the proposal and the company got the contract on [[July 2]], [[1951 in aviation|1951]].{{ref|boyne}}

=== First flight ===
The first  flight of the '''YC-130''' [[prototype]] was made on [[August 23]], [[1954 in aviation|1954]] from the [[Lockheed]] plant in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]]. The aircraft, serial number 53-3397, was the second prototype but the first of the two to fly. The YC-130 was piloted by Stanley Beltz and Roy Wimmer on its 61-minute flight to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; Jack Real and Dick Stanton served as flight engineers. Kelly Johnson, apparently repenting from his dislike of the design, flew chase in a [[P2V Neptune]].{{ref|dabney}}

=== Production ===
[[Image:Canada CC-130 Hercules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Canadian Forces Air Command|Canadian Air Force]] CC-130 Hercules]]
After the two prototypes were completed, production moved to [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where more than 2,000 C-130s have been built.{{ref|afm}}

The initial production model, the '''C-130A''', was powered by [[Allison T56]] turboprops with 3-blade [[Propeller|propellers]]. Deliveries began in December of [[1956 in aviation|1956]], continuing until the introduction of the '''C-130B''' model in [[1959 in aviation|1959]]. Some A models were redesignated '''C-130D''' after being equipped with [[Ski|skis]] and for [[JATO|jet-assisted takeoff]]. The newer C-130B had [[Aileron|ailerons]] with more boost — 3,000 versus 2,050 lbf/in² (21 versus 14 MPa) — as well as uprated engines and four-bladed propellers that were standard until the late 1990s. The performance gains over the C-130A gave the C-130B the reputation of being the design's 'sports car' model. 

The extended range '''C-130E''' model entered service in [[1962 in aviation|1962]]. The increased range was achieved by underwing fuel 5,150 litre (1,360 US gallon) tanks and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T-56-A-7A turboprops. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight.

The '''KC-130''' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally '''C-130F'''s procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in [[1958 in aviation|1958]] (under the designation '''GV-1'''), are equipped with a removable 13,626 litre (3600 US gallon) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue [[aerial refueling]] pods each transfer up to 19 litres per second (equivalent to 300 US gallons per minute) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s '''C-130G''' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.

The '''C-130H''' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in [[1964 in aviation|1964]], remaining in production until [[1996 in aviation|1996]]. An improved C-130H was introduced in [[1974 in aviation|1974]]. The equivalent model for export to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is the '''C-130K''', known by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as the '''Hercules C.1'''. The '''C-130H-30''' ('''Hercules C.3''' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 2.54m plug aft of the cockpit and a 2.03m plug at the rear of the fuselage.

The '''C-130R''' and '''C-130T''' are US Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The C-130T is similar, but has numerous avionics improvements over the R model and is fully [[night-vision]] system compatible. In both models, USMC aircraft are equipped with Allison T-56-A-16 engines.

=== Civilian use ===
The '''Lockheed L-100''' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without pylon tanks or military equipment. The L-100 also has 2 stretched versions: the L-100-20 has an 8.3 ft (2.5 m) fuselage stretch and the L-100-30 is stretched by 15 ft (4.6 m). The L-100 has not seen widespread use in the civilian market.

=== Next generation ===
[[image:hercules.propeller.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The propellers of RAF Hercules C.4 (C-130J-30)]]

In the 1970s Lockheed constructed one C-130 with [[Turbofan engine|turbofan engines]] rather than turboprops, but the US Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. However, the project was cancelled and the C-130 has remained in production.

The '''C-130J''' is the newest version of the Hercules and the only model still produced. Externally similar to the classic Hercules, the J model is a radically different aircraft under the exterior. These differences include new [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] [[Allison AE2100]] turboprops with six-bladed [[composite material|composite]] [[Scimitar propeller|scimitar propellers]], digital avionics (including [[Head-Up Display|head-up displays]] for each pilot), reduced manpower requirements (2 pilots&amp;mdash;no navigator or flight engineer), increased reliability and up to 27% lower operating costs. The C-130J is also available in a standard-length or stretched C-130J-30 version. Lockheed received the launch order for J model from the RAF, who ordered 25 aircraft, with first deliveries beginning in [[1999 in aviation|1999]]. The RAF calls the C-130J the '''Hercules C.5''' and the stretched C-130J-30 the '''Hercules C.4'''.

The largest operator of the new model will be the USAF, who are ordering the aircraft in increasing numbers, although as of [[2005 in aviation|2005]] the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] announced that C-130J acquisition would be dramatically cut back. Current operators of the C-130J are the USAF, USMC (KC-130J tanker), [[Air National Guard|US Air National Guard]], [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]], RAF, [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (but will be phased out for the [[C-17]]), [[Danish Air Force]] and the [[Italian Air Force]].

Lockheed also offered leasing of four C-130J to the German [[Luftwaffe]], who is in need for a [[Transall]]-Replacement until the [[Airbus]] [[A400M]] is available in 2010.

==Significant operational use==
[[Image:Hercules Duxford.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A Hercules C.5 at the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], [[England]]]]
While the C-130 is involved in cargo and resupply operations daily, it has been a part of some notable operations. One of the most famous events involving the Hercules was the [[1976]] [[Entebbe raid]] in which [[Israel|Israeli]] [[commando]] forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner Hijacked by [[Palestinian]] and [[Germany|German]] [[terrorists]] at [[Entebbe Airport]], [[Uganda]]. The rescue force — 200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black [[Mercedes-Benz]] (intended to resemble Ugandan [[Dictator]] [[Idi Amin]]'s vehicle of state) — was flown 4,000km from Israel to Entebbe by five [[Israeli Air Force]] ([[IAF]]) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the planes refueled in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]). 

The Hercules also holds the record of the largest and heaviest airplane to land on an [[aircraft carrier]]. In November [[1963]], a C-130 landed without using the ship's arresting gear on the [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)]]. The pilot, Lt. James Flatley III, was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his participation. The tests were highly successful, but the idea was considered too risky for routine &quot;[[Carrier onboard delivery|Carrier On-board Delivery]]&quot;) (COD) operations. Instead, the [[C-2 Greyhound]] was developed as a dedicated COD aircraft.

The '''MC-130''' variant carries and deploys what are currently the world's largest conventional [[bomb]]s, the [[BLU-82]] &quot;daisy cutter&quot; and [[GBU-43/B]] [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]]. Daisy cutters were used during the [[Vietnam War]] to clear landing zones for [[Helicopter|helicopters]] and to eliminate [[land mine|minefields]] and have recently even been proposed for anti-personnel use. The weight and size of the weapons make existing [[bomber aircraft]] impossible or impractical for operational use.

A prominent C-130T aircraft is '''Fat Albert''', the support aircraft for the US Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team. Although Fat Albert supports a Navy squadron, its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some [[Air Show|air shows]] featuring the flight team, Fat Albert takes part, performing flyovers and sometimes demonstrating its jet-assisted take off capabilities.

===Notable crashes===
[[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[President of Pakistan|president]] of [[Pakistan]] from [[1978]], was killed on [[August 17]] [[1988]], when the C-130 he was in wobbled shortly after take off from [[Bahawalpur]] and then crashed. The then-US ambassador to Pakistan and a US [[general]] were also killed, alongside everyone else on-board.

On [[January 30]] [[2005]], an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Hercules with 10 crew on board was hit by insurgent fire while taking off from Baghdad airport for Balad. Less than 24 minutes later, it crashed, as fire triggered by the hit induced an explosion in the right hand wing fuel tank, leaving the plane uncontrollable.

On [[December 6]] [[2005]], an [[Iranian Air Force]] C-130 military [[transport aircraft]] [[Iranian Air Force C-130 crash in Tehran|crashed into a ten-floor apartment building]], home to a number of air force personnel, in a residential area of [[Tehran]], the capital city of [[Iran]]. Bound for [[Bandar Abbas]] on the Persian Gulf, the aeroplane was carrying 84 passengers (68 of whom were journalists due to watch military exercises off the country's south coast) and 10 crew members. In total 116 people were confirmed dead, (as of [[December 8]] 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Commodore 1570''' was a 5&amp;frac14;&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive for the [[Commodore 128]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]. It was a single-sided, 170KB version of the double-sided [[Commodore 1571]], released as a [[stopgap]] measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms.  Like the 1571, it could read and write both [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] and [[MFM]] disk formats.

The 1570 utilized a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541]] case with a 1541 drive mechanism. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provided a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contained some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later.  The 1570 could read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]] format disks that the 1571 could access.

Although the 1570 was compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 wasn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it was little more than a pricier 1541.  Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.

The '''Commodore 1571''' was [[Commodore International|Commodore's]] high-end 5&amp;frac14;&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive. With its double-sided drive mechanism, it had the ability to utilized double-sided, double-density (DS/DD) floppy disks natively. This was in contrast to its predecesors, the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1570|1570]], which could read or write such disks only by manually flipping them over to access the second side.

The 1571 was released to match the [[Commodore 128]], both design-wise and feature-wise. It was announced in the summer of [[1985]], at the same time as the C128, and became available in quantity later that year. The later C128''D'' had a 1571 compatible drive integrated in the system unit. A double-sided disk on the 1571 could hold 332 [[Kilobyte|KB]] of data, formatted as 1,328 disk blocks of 256 [[byte]]s each.

The 1571 featured a &quot;burst mode&quot; when used in conjunction with the C128 (although not when used with the [[Commodore 64]] or [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]). This mode replaced the slow [[bit-banging]] serial routines of the 1541 with a true serial [[shift register]] implemented in hardware, thus dramatically increasing the drive speed. Although this had originally been planned when Commodore first switched from the parallel [[IEEE-488]] interface to a custom serial interface, hardware bugs in the VIC-20's [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]] shift register prevented it from working properly [http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php].

For compatibility with copy-protected software, the 1571 could also closely emulate the 1541. This mode was the default when the drive was used in conjunction with a C64.

The 1571 was noticeably quieter than its predecessor and tended to run cooler as well, even though, like the 1541, it had the power supply inside the unit (later Commodore drives, like the 1541-II and the 3&amp;frac12;&quot; [[Commodore 1581|1581]], came with external power supplies). The 1541-II/1581 power supply makes mention of a 1571-II, hinting that Commodore may have intended to release a version of the 1571 with an external power supply. However, no 1571-IIs are known to exist. The embedded OS in the 1571 was [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS V3.0 1571]], an improvement over the 1541's V2.6.

Unlike the 1541, which was limited to [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] formatting, the 1571 could do both GCR and [[MFM]] disk formats. A C128 in CP/M mode equipped with a 1571 was capable of reading and writing floppy disks formatted for many [[CP/M]] computers; specifically, the following formats:
* [[IBM PC]] [[CP/M-86]]
* [[Osborne 1]]
* Epson QX10
* [[Kaypro]] II, IV

With additional software, it was possible to read and write to [[DOS]]-formatted floppies as well. Numerous commercial and public-domain programs for this purpose became available, the best known being [[SOGWAP]]'s &quot;Big Blue Reader&quot;. Although the C128 could not run any DOS-based software, this capability allowed data files to be exchanged with PC users.

Like the 1541, Commodore initially had difficulty keeping up with demand for the 1571, and that lack of availability and the drive's relatively high price (about US$300) presented an opportunity for cloners. Two 1571 clones, one from Oceanic and one from Blue Chip, appeared, but legal action from Commodore quickly succeeded in driving them from the market.

Commodore announced a dual-drive version of the 1571, to be called the 1572, but quickly cancelled it, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the 1572 DOS.

:''This article is about the drug Cocaine. For the blues song by [[J.J. Cale]] (later covered by [[Eric Clapton]]) see [[Cocaine (song)]]''.

'''Cocaine''' is a [[crystalline]] [[tropane]] [[alkaloid]] that is obtained from the leaves of the [[coca]] plant. It is a [[stimulant]] of the [[central nervous system]] and an [[appetite suppressant]], creating what has been described as a euphoric sense of happiness and increased energy. Though most often used recreationally for this effect, cocaine is also a topical [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] that was used in [[eye surgery|eye]] and throat [[surgery]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Cocaine is highly [[addiction|addictive]], and its possession, cultivation, and distribution is illegal for non-medicinal / non-government sanctioned purposes in virtually all parts of the world.

For thousands of years and still today, [[South America]]n [[Native American (Americas)|indigenous peoples]] have chewed the [[coca]] leaf (''Erythroxylon coca''), a plant which contains vital nutrients as well as numerous [[alkaloids]], including cocaine. The leaf was and is chewed almost universally by some [[tribe|indigenous communities]], but there is no evidence that its habitual use ever led to any of the negative consequences generally associated with habitual cocaine use today.

[[Image:Coca.jpg|168px|left|thumb|The coca plant, ''Erythroxylon coca''.]]

When the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards conquered South America]], they at first ignored Aboriginal claims that the leaf gave them strength and energy, and declared the practice of chewing it the work of the [[Devil]]. But after discovering that these claims were true, they legalized and taxed the leaf, taking 10% off the value of each crop. These taxes were for a time the main source of support for the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the region.

In [[1609]] Padre [[Blas Valera]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Coca protects the body from many ailments, and our doctors use it in powdered form to reduce the swelling of wounds, to strengthen broken bones, to expel cold from the body or prevent it from entering, and to cure rotten wounds or sores that are full of maggots. And if it does so much for outward ailments, will not its singular virtue have even greater effect in the entrails of those who eat it?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Isolation===  

Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine [[alkaloid]] was not achieved until [[1855]]. Many scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time, and coca does not grow in [[Europe]] and is easily ruined during travel.

The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] in [[1855]]. Gaedcke named the alkaloid “erythroxyline”, and published a description in the journal ''[[Archives de Pharmacie]]''.

In [[1856]] [[Friederich Wöhler]] asked Dr. [[Carl Scherzer]], a scientist aboard the ''[[Novara]]'' (an [[Austria]]n frigate sent by Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In [[1859]] the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to [[Albert Niemann]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student at the [[University of Göttingen]] in [[Germany]], who then developed an improved purification process.

Niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his [[dissertation]] entitled ''[[On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves]]'', which was published in [[1860]] &amp;mdash; it also earned him his Ph.D. and is now in the [[British Library]]. He wrote of the alkaloid's “colourless transparent prisms” and said that, “Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.” Niemann named the alkaloid “cocaine” — as with other [[alkaloid]]s its name carried the “-ine” [[suffix]] (from [[Latin]] ''-ina'').

===Popularization===
In [[1859]] an [[Italy|Italian]] [[physician|doctor]] [[Paolo Mantegazza]] returned from [[Peru]], where he had witnessed first-hand the use of coca by the natives. He proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to [[Milan]] he wrote a paper in which he described the effects. In this paper he declared coca and cocaine (at the time they were assumed to be the same) as being useful medicinally, in the treatment of “a furred tongue in the morning, [[flatulence]], [and] whitening of the teeth.” 

[[Image:Mariani_pope.jpg|320px|right|thumb|[[Pope Leo XIII]] purportedly carried a hipflask of Vin Mariani with him, and awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] [[gold medal]] to [[Angelo Mariani]].]]
A chemist named [[Angelo Mariani]] who read Mantegaza’s paper became immediately intrigued with coca, and its economic potential. In [[1863]] Mariani started marketing a [[wine]] called [[Vin Mariani]] which had been treated with coca leaves. The [[alcohol|ethanol]] in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink’s effect. It contained 6&amp;nbsp;mg cocaine per ounce of wine, but Vin Mariani which was to be exported contained 7.2&amp;nbsp;mg per ounce in order to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. A “pinch of coca leaves” was included in John Styth Pemberton's original 1886 recipe for [[Coca-Cola]], though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was passed. The only known measure of the amount of cocaine in Coca-Cola was determined in [[1902]] as being as little as 1/400 of a [[grain (measure)|grain]] (0.2&amp;nbsp;mg) per ounce of syrup. (6&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]].) The actual amount of cocaine that Coca-Cola contained during the first twenty years of its production is impossible to determine.

In [[1879]] cocaine began to be used to treat [[morphine]] addiction. Cocaine was introduced into clinical use as a [[local anaesthetic]] in Germany in [[1884]], about the same time as [[Sigmund Freud]] published his work ''[[Über Coca]]'', in which he wrote that cocaine causes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...exhilaration and lasting euphoria, which in no way differs from the normal euphoria of the healthy person...You perceive an increase of self-control and possess more vitality and capacity for work....In other words, you are simply normal, and it is soon hard to believe you are under the influence of any drug....Long intensive physical work is performed without any fatigue...This result is enjoyed without any of the unpleasant after-effects that follow exhilaration brought about by alcohol....Absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaine appears after the first, or even after repeated taking of the drug...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Cocaine tooth drops.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Cocaine, the fast-acting anesthetic.]]In [[1885]] the U.S. manufacturer [[Parke-Davis]] sold cocaine in various forms, including cigarettes, powder, and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the user’s veins with the included needle. The company promised that its cocaine products would “supply the place of food, make the coward brave, the silent eloquent and ... render the sufferer insensitive to pain.”

By late [[Victorian era]] cocaine use had appeared as a vice in [[literature]], for example as the ''cucaine'' injected by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]’s fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]].

In [[1909]] [[Ernest Shackleton]] took “Forced March” brand cocaine tablets to [[Antarctica]], as did [[Captain Scott]] a year later on his ill-fated journey to the [[south pole]].

===Prohibition===
By the turn of the twentieth century, the addictive properties of cocaine had become clear to many, and the problem of cocaine abuse began to capture public attention in the United States. The dangers of cocaine abuse became part of a [[moral panic]] that was tied to the dominant racial and social anxieties of the day. In [[1903]] the ''[[American Journal of Pharmacy]]'' stressed that most cocaine abusers were “bohemians, gamblers, high- and low-class [[prostitutes]], night porters, bell boys, burglars, racketeers, pimps, and casual laborers.” In [[1914]] Dr. Christopher Koch of [[Pennsylvania]]’s State Pharmacy Board made the racial innuendo explicit, testifying that, “Most of the attacks upon the white women of the South are the direct result of a cocaine-crazed Negro brain.” Mass media manufactured an epidemic of cocaine use amongst [[African-Americans]] in the [[Southern United States]] to play upon racial prejudices of the era, although there is little evidence that such an epidemic actually took place. In the same year, the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] outlawed the use of cocaine in the United States.

===Modern usage===
In most Western countries, cocaine (known colloquially as &quot;coke&quot;, &quot;nose candy&quot;, &quot;blow&quot;, &quot;snow&quot;, etc.; see [[List of street names of drugs]]) is a popular [[recreational drug]]. In the [[United States]], the development of &quot;[[Cocaine#Crack_cocaine|crack]]&quot; cocaine introduced the substance to a generally poorer inner-city market. Use of the powder form has stayed relatively constant, experiencing a new height of use during the late [[1990s]] and early [[2000s]] in the [[USA]], and has become much more popular in the last few years in the [[UK]].

Cocaine use is prevalent across all socioeconomic strata, including age, demographics, economic, social, political, religious, and livelihood. Cocaine in its various forms comes in second only to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as the most popular illegal recreational drug in the [[United States]], and is number one in street value sold each year.

The estimated U.S. cocaine market exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]35 billion in street value for the year [[2003]], exceeding revenues by corporations such as [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Starbucks]]. There is a tremendous demand for cocaine in the U.S. market, particularly among those who are making incomes affording [[luxury]] spending, such as single adults and various professionals. Cocaine’s status as a [[club drug]] shows its immense popularity among the “party crowd”.  Cocaine’s high revenues may be due to the drug’s psychologically addictive nature, which makes the cessation of use quite difficult. It has become much more popular as a middle class drug in the [[United Kingdom]] in recent years.

==Pharmacology==
===Appearance===
[[Image:Cocaine3.jpg|166px|right|thumb|Cocaine powder.]]
Cocaine in its purest form is a white, pearly product. Cocaine appearing in powder form is a [[salt]], typically cocaine [[hydrochloride]] ([[CAS registry number|CAS]] 53-21-4). Cocaine is frequently adulterated or “cut” with various powdery fillers to increase its surface area; the substances most commonly used in this process are [[baking soda]], sugars, such as [[lactose]], [[inositol]], and [[mannitol]], and local anesthetics, such as [[lidocaine]]. Adulterated cocaine is often a white, off-white or pinkish powder. 

The color of “crack” cocaine depends upon several factors including the origin of the cocaine used, the method of preparation — with [[ammonia]] or [[sodium bicarbonate]], and the presence of impurities, but will generally range from a light brown to a pale brown. Its texture will also depend on the factors which affect color, but will range from a crumbly texture, which is usually the lighter variety, to hard, almost crystalline nature, which is usually the darker variety.

===Forms of cocaine===
====Cocaine sulfate====
Cocaine sulfate is produced by [[Maceration|macerating]] coca leaves along with [[water]] that has been acidulated with [[sulfuric acid]], or a naphtha-based solvent, like [[kerosene]] or [[benzene]]. This is often accomplished by putting the ingredients into a vat and stamping on it, in a manner similar to the traditional method for crushing [[grape]]s. After the cocaine is extracted, the water is evaporated to yield a pastey mass of impure cocaine sulfate.

The sulfate itself is an intermediate step to producing cocaine hydrochloride. In [[South America]] it is commonly smoked along with tobacco, and is known as ''pasta'', ''basuco'', ''basa'', ''pitillo'', ''paco'' or simply ''paste''. It is also gaining popularity as a cheap drug (.30-.70 U.S. cents per &quot;hit&quot; or dose) in [[Argentina]].

====Freebase====
{{main|Freebase}}
As the name implies, “freebase” is the [[Base (chemistry)|base]] form of cocaine, as opposed to the [[salt]] form of cocaine hydrochloride. Whereas cocaine hydrochloride is extremely [[soluble]] in [[water]], cocaine base is insoluble in water and is therefore not suitable for drinking, snorting or injecting. Cocaine hydrochloride is not well-suited for smoking because the [[temperature]] at which it [[evaporation|vaporizes]] is very high, and close to the temperature at which it [[combustion|burns]]; however, cocaine base [[evaporation|vaporizes]] at a low temperature, which makes it suitable for inhalation.

Smoking freebase is preferred by many users because the cocaine is absorbed immediately into [[blood]] via the [[lungs]], where it reaches the [[brain]] in about five seconds. The rush is much more intense than sniffing the same amount of cocaine nasally, but the effects do not last as long. The peak of the freebase rush is over almost as soon as the user exhales the vapor, but the high typically lasts 5–10 minutes afterwards. What makes freebasing particularly dangerous is that users typically don't wait that long for their next hit and will continue to smoke freebase until none is left. These effects are similar to those that can be achieved by injecting or “slamming” cocaine hydrochloride, but without the risks associated with [[intravenous]] drug use (although there are other serious risks associated with smoking freebase).

Freebase cocaine is produced by first dissolving cocaine hydrochloride in water. Once dissolved in water, cocaine hydrochloride (Coc HCl) disassociates into protonated cocaine [[ion]] (CocH&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[chloride]] ion (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Any [[solid]]s that remain in the [[solution]] are not cocaine (they are part of the cut) and are removed by [[Filter (chemistry)|filtering]]. A base, typically [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), is added to the [[solution]] to remove the extra [[proton]] from the cocaine. The following net [[chemical reaction]] takes place:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 2em;&quot;&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + CocH&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  → NH&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + Coc&lt;/div&gt;

As freebase cocaine (Coc) is insoluble in water, it [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] and the solution becomes cloudy. To recover the freebase, [[diethyl ether]] is added to the solution: Since freebase is highly soluble in ether, a vigorous shaking of the mixture results in the freebase being dissolved in the ether. As [[ether]] is insoluble in water, it can be [[siphon]]ed off. The ether is then left to evaporate, leaving behind the nearly pure freebase.

This procedure is dangerous because of the hazards of handling diethyl ether: it is extremely [[flammable]], its vapors are heavier than air and can “creep” from an open bottle, and in the presence of oxygen it can form [[diethyl ether peroxide|peroxide]]s which can spontaneously combust. Demonstrative of the dangers of the practice, the famous comedian [[Richard Pryor]] used to perform a well known skit in which he poked fun at himself during a 1980 incident in which he caused an explosion and set himself on fire while attempting to smoke “freebase”, presumably still wet with ether.

====Crack cocaine====
[[Image:Crack street dosage.jpg|thumb|right|A pile of crack cocaine &quot;rocks&quot;.]]
Because of the dangers of using ether to produce pure freebase cocaine, cocaine producers began to omit the step of removing the freebase cocaine precipitate from the ammonia mixture. Typically, filtration processes are also omitted. The end result of this process is that the cut, in addition to the ammonium salt (NH&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), remains in the freebase cocaine after the mixture is evaporated. The “rock” which is thus formed also contains a small amount of water. When the rock is heated this water boils, making a crackling sound (hence the name “crack”). [[Baking soda]] is now most often used as a base rather than ammonia for reasons of lowered stench and toxicity; however, any weak base can be used to make crack cocaine. Strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide, tend to [[hydrolyze]] some of the cocaine into non-psychoactive [[ecgonine]].

The net reaction when using baking soda (also called sodium bicarbonate, with a chemical formula of NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is:
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 2em;&quot;&gt;CocH&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; → Coc + H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + NaCl&lt;/div&gt;

Crack is unique because it offers a strong cocaine experience in small, low-priced packages. In the [[United States]], crack cocaine is often sold in small, inexpensive dosage units frequently known as “nickels” or “nickel rocks” (referring to the price of [[United States dollar|$]]5.00), and also “dimes” or “dime rocks” ($10.00) and sometimes as “twenties” or “solids”, and “forties”. The quantity provided by such a purchase varies depending upon many factors, such as local availability, which is affected by geographic location. A twenty may yield a quarter gram or half gram on average, yielding 30 minutes to an hour of effect if hits are taken every few minutes. After the $20 or $40 mark, crack and powder cocaine are sold in grams or fractions of ounces. Many inner-city addicts with a regular dealer will “work a corner”, taking money from anyone who wants crack, making a buy from the dealer, then delivering part of the product while keeping some for themselves. 

Although consisting of the same active drug as powder cocaine, crack cocaine in the United States is seen as a drug primarily by and for the inner city poor (the stereotypical &quot;crack head&quot; is a poor, urban, usually [[homeless]] [[person of color]]). While insufflated powder cocaine has an associated glamour attributed to its popularity among mostly middle and upper class whites (as well as [[musician]]s and entertainers), crack is perceived as a [[skid row]] drug of squalor and desperation. In many US jurisdictions, possession or sale of crack cocaine carries a harsher penalty than an equivalent amount of powder cocaine.

Street names for crack include “bones”, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, “devil’s [[dandruff]]”, &quot;devil's candy&quot;, “devil drug”, “devilsmoke”, “dope” &quot;food”, &quot;girl&quot;,“hard”, &quot;juice&quot;, &quot;krills&quot;, “lle&quot; (Spanish), “llello&quot; (Spanish), “matter”, “smoke”, &quot;white bitch&quot;, “work”, &quot;yay”, &quot;yayo”, &quot;yeyo&quot;, “yoda”, “yola” &quot;Sos&quot; or &quot;Sosa&quot; (Dutch); but most commonly, it is simply called “rock”. Crack cocaine was extremely popular in the mid and late [[1980s]], especially in inner cities, although its popularity declined through the [[1990s]]. In [[1998]], [[Gary Webb]]'s book ''Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion'' linked the “crack explosion” to the [[CIA]] funding of the [[anti-Communism]] [[Contras]] fighting against [[Sandinistas]] in [[Nicaragua]].

===Methods of administration===
====Chewed/eaten====
The '''simplest''' way to administer cocaine is to chew on the leaves of the plant. Because of physical restrictions of this modality, only small amounts of cocaine make it into the [[bloodstream]] and the effect is that of a mild stimulant. ''Mate de coca''  or coca-leaf tea is also a traditional method of consumption and is often recommended to treat [[altitude sickness]].

In [[1986]] an article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' revealed that health food stores were selling coca-leaf tea as “Health Inca Tea”. While the packaging claimed it had been “decocainized”, no such process had taken place—they were selling a controlled substance off the shelves. The article stated that drinking two cups of the tea per day gave a mild [[stimulation]], increased [[heart rate]], and [[Emotional mood|mood]] elevation, and the tea was essentially harmless. Despite this, the [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]] seized several shipments in [[Hawaii]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and several locations on the [[East Coast of the United States]], and the product was removed from the shelves.

====Insufflation====
[[Insufflation]] (known colloquially as “snorting” or “sniffing”) is the most common method of ingestion of recreational powder cocaine in the Western world. Contrary to widespread belief, cocaine is not actually inhaled using this method; rather the drug coats and is absorbed through the [[mucous membrane]]s lining the [[sinus]]es. When insufflating cocaine, absorption through the nasal membranes is approximately 80%. Any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membranes is collected in [[mucus]] and swallowed (this &quot;drip&quot; is considered pleasant by some and unpleasant by others). Chronic use results in ongoing [[rhinitis]] and [[necrosis]] of the nasal membranes. Cellulose [[granuloma]]s from adulterants have also been found in the lungs of recreational “sniffers”.

Prior to insufflation cocaine powder must be divided into very fine particles. Cocaine of high purity breaks into smallest dust very easily, except when it's moist (not well stored) and forms “chunks”, which reduce the efficiency of nasal absorption. 

Rolled up [[currency|banknotes]], hollowed-out [[pen]]s, cut [[drinking straw|straw]]s and specialized [[spoon|spoons]] are often used to insufflate cocaine.  Such devices are often referred to as 'tooters' by users. The cocaine typically is poured onto a flat, hard surface (such as a [[mirror]]) and divided into &quot;lines&quot; (usually with a [[razor blade]] or [[credit card]]) which are then insufflated. The amount of cocaine in a line varies widely from person to person and occasion to occasion (the purity of the cocaine is also a factor), but one line is generally considered to be a single dose.

Insufflating can cause coughs and nosebleeds.

====Injected====
The intravenous route of administration provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest time. It can get to the brain within 15 seconds.  Injection of cocaine produces an exhilarating rush so intense that often the user may vomit uncontrollably, although the euphoria passes quickly as the liver rapidly metabolizes the drug. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory [[embolism|emboli]] from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. Obviously, there is also a risk of serious infection associated with the use of contaminated needles. 

An injected mixture of cocaine and [[heroin]], known as “[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]” or “moonrock”, is a particularly popular and dangerous combination, as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other, but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose. It has been responsible for numerous deaths, particularly in and around [[Los Angeles]], including celebrities such as [[John Belushi]], [[Chris Farley]] and [[Layne Staley]]. Experimentally, cocaine injections can be delivered to animals such as fruit flies [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15262059&amp;query_hl=21] to study the mechanisms of cocaine addiction.

====Smoked====
[[Image:Leslie-crack.jpg|thumb|250px|A woman smoking crack from a glass pipe]]
''(see also: [[Cocaine#Crack cocaine|Crack cocaine]] above)''

Smoking freebase or crack cocaine is most often accomplished using a pipe made from a small glass tube about one quarter-inch (about 6&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter and up to several inches long.  These are sometimes called &quot;straight shooters&quot;; readily available in convenience stores or smoke shops. They will sometimes contain a small paper flower and are promoted as a romantic gift. Buyers usually ask for a &quot;rose&quot; or a &quot;flower&quot;.  An alternate method is to use a small length of a radio antenna or similar metal tube.  To avoid burning the user’s fingers and lips on the metal pipe, a small piece of paper or cardboard (such as a piece torn from a matchbook cover) is wrapped around one end of the pipe and held in place with either a rubber band or a piece of adhesive tape.

A small piece of steel or copper scouring pad — often called a [[Brillo Pad|&quot;brillo&quot;]] or [[Chore Boy|&quot;chore&quot;]], from the scouring pads of the same name — is placed into one end of the tube after having the [[soap]]y cleanser coating burned off the metal. It then serves as a crude filter in which the &quot;rock&quot; can melt and boil to vapor. The use of steel wool also acts as a reducing agent, preventing the oxidisation of the cocaine.

The &quot;rock&quot; is placed at the end of the pipe closest to the filter and the other end of the pipe is placed in the mouth. A flame from a cigarette lighter or handheld torch is then held under the rock. As the rock is heated, it melts and burns away to vapor which the user inhales as smoke. 
The effects are felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense, and do not last long &amp;mdash; usually five to fifteen minutes. Most users will want more after this time, especially frequent users. &quot;Crack houses&quot; depend on these cravings by providing users a place to smoke, and a ready supply of small bags for sale.

A heavily used [[crackpipe]] tends to fracture at the end from overheating with the flame used to heat the crack as the user obsessively attempts to inhale every bit of the drug on the metal wool filter.  The end is often broken further as the user &quot;pushes&quot; the pipe. &quot;Pushing&quot; is a technique used to partially recover crack which hardens on the inside wall of the pipe as the pipe cools. The user pushes the metal wool filter through the pipe from one end to the other to collect the build-up inside the pipe. The ends of the pipe can be broken by the object used to push the filter, frequently a small screwdriver or stiff piece of wire. The user will often remove the most jagged edges and continue using the pipe until it becomes so short that it burns the lips and fingers.  To continue using the pipe, the user will sometimes wrap a small piece of paper or cardboard around one end and hold it in place with a rubber band or adhesive tape.  Of course, not all people who smoke crack cocaine will let it get that short, and will get a new or different pipe. The tell-tale signs of a used crack pipe are a glass tube with burn marks at one or both ends and a clump of metal wool inside.

When smoked, cocaine is sometimes combined with other drugs, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]; often rolled into a joint or [[Blunt (drug culture)|blunt]]. This combination is known as “[[primo]]”, “hype”, B-151er, &quot;a cocoapuff&quot;, &quot;a dirty&quot; or a “woo”. Crack smokers who are being drug tested may also make their “primo” with cigarette tobacco instead of cannabis, since a crack smoker can test clean within 2 to 3 days of use, if only urine (and not hair) is being tested.

===Mechanism of action===

Once cocaine is introduced into the bloodstream its acute clinical effects can be observed once the drug crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]]. This process can occur within seconds following administration, but can also last upwards of a half an hour. The delay in the onset of effects is largely determined by the method of administration. 

The primary mechanism of cocaine within the central nervous system is the blockage of the [[monoamine transporter|dopamine transporter]] (DAT). DAT is a protein that functions as a &quot;clean-up&quot; mechanism for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]] once it is no longer needed for inter-cell signalling. The extra dopamine within the synaptic cleft binds to the DAT and is then carried back to the pre-synaptic neuron for repackaging and re-release at a future date. Because cocaine's chemical structure allows it to bind to the DAT it interferes with this re-uptake process. 

The [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), the [[nucleus accumbens]] and the prefrontal cortex are regions of the brain that are rich with dopamine receptors and dopamine-releasing neurons. Hence they are often the focus of research into the addictive and rewarding properties of cocaine use.  

Cocaine is also a less potent blocker of the [[monoamine transporter|norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT). Cocaine also blocks [[ion channel|sodium channels]], thereby interfering with the propagation of [[action potential]]s; thus, like [[lidocaine]] and [[novocaine]], it acts as a local anesthetic. The locomotor enhancing properties of cocaine may be attributable to its enhancement of dopaminergic transmission from the [[substantia nigra]]. Recent research points to an important role of circadian mechanisms [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12865893&amp;query_hl=16] and clock genes [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15967985&amp;query_hl=18] in behavioral actions of cocaine.


Since [[nicotine]] increases the levels of dopamine in the brain, many cocaine users find that consumption of [[tobacco]] products during cocaine use enhances the euphoria. This, however, may have undesirable consequences, such as uncontrollable [[chain smoking]] during cocaine use (even users who don't normally smoke [[cigarettes]] have been known to chain smoke when using cocaine), in addition to the detrimental health effects and the additional strain on the cardiovascular system caused by tobacco.

===Metabolism and excretion===
Cocaine is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]], primarily in the [[liver]], with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. It is mostly eliminated as [[benzoylecgonine]], the major [[metabolite]] of cocaine, and is also excreted in lesser amounts as ecgonine methyl ester and ecgonine.

If taken with [[ethanol|alcohol]], cocaine combines with the ethanol in the [[liver]] to form [[cocaethylene]], which is both more [[euphoria|euphorigenic]] and has higher [[cardiovascular]] toxicity than cocaine by itself.

Cocaine metabolites are detectable in urine for up to four days after cocaine is used. Benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine within four hours after cocaine inhalation and remains detectable in concentrations greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;ng/ml for as long as 48 hours. Detection in hair is possible in regular users until the sections of hair grown during use are cut or fall out.

===Effects and health issues===
Cocaine is a potent [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]]. Its effects can last from 20 minutes to several hours, depending upon the dosage of cocaine taken, purity, and method of administration.

The initial signs of stimulation are hyperactivity, restlessness, increased [[blood pressure]], increased [[heart rate]] and [[euphoria]]. The euphoria is sometimes followed by feelings of discomfort and depression and a craving to re-experience the drug. Side effects can include twitching and [[paranoia]], which usually increase with frequent usage.

With excessive dosage the drug can produce [[hallucination]]s, paranoid delusions, [[tachycardia]], [[itch]]ing, and [[formication]].

Overdose causes tachyarrhythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure. These can be life threatening, especially if the user has existing cardiac problems. 

Cocaine raises the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens; the &quot;crash&quot; experienced after the initial high is marked by an undershooting of normal levels afterwards. This is because neurons run out of dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitters. Receptors disappear as a response mechanism to too much neurotransmitter. This contributes to the rise in an abuser's tolerance thus requiring a larger dosage to achieve the same effect. The lack of normal amounts of serotonin and dopamine in the brain is the cause of the dysphoria and depression felt after the initial high. The diagnostic criteria for cocaine withdrawal is characterized by a dysphoric mood, fatigue, unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and anxiety.

The [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of Cocaine when administered to mice is 95.1 mg/kg.  Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from [[respiratory failure]], [[stroke]], [[cerebral hemorrhage]], or [[heart]]-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense [[vasoconstriction]]. Cocaine-induced [[hyperthermia]] may cause muscle cell destruction and [[myoglobinuria]] resulting in [[renal failure]]. There is no specific [[antidote]] for cocaine overdose.

Cocaine abuse is associated with a lifetime risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that is seven times that of non-users. During the hour after cocaine is used, [[heart attack]] risk rises 24-fold. It accounts for 25% of the heart attacks in the 18&amp;ndash;45 year-old age group.

Side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include chest pain, lung trauma, shortness of breath, sore throat, hoarse voice, [[dyspnea]], and an aching, [[flu]]-like syndrome. A common misconception is that the smoking of cocaine breaks down [[tooth enamel]] and causes [[tooth decay]].  Although this is not true, the lifestyle of frequent cocaine users may include poor dental hygiene, which often results in tooth decay.  In addition, cocaine often causes involuntary tooth grinding, known as [[bruxism]], which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to [[gingivitis]].

Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the [[cartilage]] separating the [[nostril]]s (the [[Septum nasi]]), leading eventually to its complete disappearance.

===Cocaine as a local anesthetic===
Cocaine was historically useful as a topical anesthetic in eye and nasal surgery. The major disadvantages of this use are cocaine's intense [[vasoconstrictor]] activity and potential for [[cardiovascular]] toxicity. Cocaine has since been largely replaced in Western medicine by synthetic local anaesthetics such as [[benzocaine]], [[proparacaine]], and [[tetracaine]] though it remains available for use if specified. If vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure (as it reduces bleeding), the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as [[phenylephrine]] or [[epinephrine]]. In [[Australia]] it is currently prescribed for use as a local anesthetic for conditions such as mouth and lung [[ulcers]]. Some Australian [[ENT]] specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal [[cauterization]]. In this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool, which is placed in the nostril for the 10-15 minutes immediately prior to the procedure, thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized and also vasoconstriction.

==== Production ====

Cocaine comes from the coca plant. The leaves are stripped from the plants and dried, then crushed into a paste, commonly using [[cement mix]] (containing [[sodium carbonate]]), [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[water]]. This then allows extraction of the cocaine alkaloid into [[kerosene]]. The resulting water immiscible solvent (kerosene) acts to extract water insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the mixture. The plant leaves are usually agitated by stomping on them or, occasionally by using a so-called agitation machine. The cocaine alkaloids and kerosene mostly separates from the water and leaves, and then needs to be strained.

The alkaloids should be extracted from the kerosene by adding a dilute [[Hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] or [[sulfuric acid]] mix then strained again. [[Potassium permanganate]] is usually added then the mix should be allowed to sit for 4-6 hours. The paste is usually further strained and ammonia added. A dubious precipitate will be formed, known as cocaine base.

The base is dried and converted to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) by soaking it in [[acetone]] and straining it. Adding diluted hydrochloric acid or Ether (cutting) should cause a precipitate to form which is usually dried under heat lamps, resulting in concentrated [[cocaine hydrochloride]].''

Purity of cocaine varies widely over a range of approximately 10 to 90 percent, with larger quantities generally more pure than smaller quantities.

==Cocaine trade==

Because of the extensive processing it undergoes during preparation and its highly addictive nature, [[cocaine]] is generally treated as a [[hard drug]], with severe penalties for possession and trafficking. Demand remains high, and consequently black market cocaine is quite expensive. Unprocessed cocaine, such as [[coca leaves]] is occasionally bought and sold, but this is exceedingly rare as it is much easier and more profitable to conceal and smuggle it in powdered form (cocaine hydrochloride).

Most cocaine is smuggled in large quantities in [[truck]]s, [[boat]]s, or small [[airplane]]s. Smaller gangs will often send out a [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mule]], often a young woman, with kilos of cocaine strapped to her waist or legs or hidden in her bags. If she gets through without being caught, the gangs will reap most of the profits. If she is caught however, gangs will sever all links and she will usually stand trial for trafficking by herself.

[[Colombia]] produces around 75% of the world's cocaine.

=== Trafficking ===

[[Organized crime|Organized criminal]] gangs operating on a large scale dominate the cocaine trade. Most cocaine is grown and processed in [[South America]], particularly in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]], and smuggled into the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], where it is sold at huge markups.

===Distribution ===

During the chain of distribution, cocaine is often adulterated or &quot;cut&quot; with a variety of substances prior to sale. Common [[adulterant]]s include [[baking soda]], sugars (such as lactose, [[inositol]], and [[mannitol]]), and local anesthetics (such as [[benzocaine]] or [[lidocaine]], which mimic or add to cocaine's numbing effect on [[mucous membrane]]s).

==Addiction==

'''Cocaine addiction''' is the obsessive or uncontrollable abuse of cocaine, and can result in physiological damage, lethargy, depression, or a potentially fatal overdose.  Many habitual abusers have been diagnosed with a manic condition similar to [[amphetamine psychosis]] and [[schizophrenia]], whose symptoms include aggression, severe paranoia, and tactile hallucinations (including the feeling of insects under the skin, or &quot;coke bugs&quot;).

Cocaine has positive reinforcement effects, which refers to the effect that certain stimuli have on behavior. Good feelings become associated with the drug, causing a frequent user to take the drug as a response to bad news or mild [[depression]]. This activation strengthens the response that was just made. If the drug was taken by a fast acting route such as injection or inhalation, the response will be the act of taking more cocaine, so the response will be reinforced. Powder cocaine, being a [[club drug]] is most commonly available in the evening and night hours. Since cocaine is a [[stimulant]], a user will often drink large amounts of [[alcohol]] during and after usage or smoke [[marijuana]] to dull the effects to help one achieve slumber. These several hours of temporary relief and pleasure will further reinforce the positive response. Other downers such as heroin and various pharmaceuticals are often used for the same purpose, further increasing addiction potential and harmfulness.

It is speculated that cocaine's addictive properties stem from its [[DAT]]-blocking effects (in particular, increasing the dopaminergic transmission from [[ventral tegmental area]] neurons). However, a study has shown that mice with no dopamine transporters still exhibit the rewarding effects of cocaine administration [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/13/7699]. Later work demonstrated that a combined DAT/SERT knockout eliminated the rewarding effects [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/9/5300]. The rewarding effects of cocaine are influenced by [[circadian rhythms]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15087244&amp;query_hl=23], possibly by involving a set of genes termed &quot;clock genes&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16094306&amp;query_hl=18].

===Treatment===

[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) shows promising results. Spiritual based [[Twelve-step program]]s such as [[Cocaine Anonymous]] (modeled on [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) have some success combatting this problem. A [[cocaine vaccine]] is also being tested which may prevent the recipient from feeling the desirable effects of the drug, although a similar effort to develop a [[heroin]] vaccine was abandoned as ineffective in the [[1970s]].

====GVG====
[[Image:Dopamine_monkey.png|300px|right|thumb|[[Positron Emission Tomography]] scans showing the average level of dopamine receptors in 6 primates's brains. Red is high- and blue is low-concentration of dopamine receptors. The higher the level of dopamine, the fewer receptors there will be.]]
Studies have shown that [[gamma vinyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (gamma vinyl-GABA, or GVG), a drug normally used to treat [[epilepsy]], blocks cocaine's action in the [[brain]]s of [[primate]]s. GVG increases the amount of the neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] in the brain and reduces the level of [[dopamine]] in the region of the brain which is thought to be involved in addiction. In January [[2005]] the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] gave permission for a Phase I [[clinical trial]] of GVG for the treatment of addiction. Another drug currently tested for anti-addictive properties is the cannabinoid antagonist [[rimonabant]].

====GBR 12909====
GBR 12909 (Vanoxerine) is a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor|selective dopamine uptake inhibitor]]. Because of this, it reduces cocaine's effect on the brain, and may help to treat cocaine addiction. Studies have shown that GBR, when given to primates, suppresses cocaine self-administration.

====Venlafaxine====
[[Venlafaxine]] ([[Effexor]]), although not a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, is a potent [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] which has been successfully used to combat the depression caused by cocaine and to a lesser extent, the addiction associated with the drug itself. Venlafaxine has been shown to have significant withdrawal problems itself, and can lead to lifetime use due to these withdrawal effects. A statistically significant number of people prescribed Effexor have committed suicide (2 attempts per 1000 patients, vs 1.56 suicides per 1000 untreated depressives).

====Coca Tea====
[[Coca tea]] has been used for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Two reports{{citation needed}} found that treatment that includes coca tea can be successful in controlling relapse to cocaine dependence. In one study, coca tea plus counseling was used to treat cocaine dependence in 23 cocaine-addicted coca paste smokers seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic in Lima, [[Peru]]. Cocaine lapses fell from 4.35 times a month prior to treatment to 1.22 during treatment. Mean abstinence increased from 32 days before treatment to 217.2 days during treatment. The results support the effectiveness of [[Coca tea]] for preventing relapse in cocaine-addicted patients.

==Usage==
===In the United States===
====Overall usage====
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) reported in [[1999]] that cocaine was used by 3.7 million Americans, or 1.7 percent of the household population aged 12 and over.  Estimates of the current number of those who use cocaine regularly (at least once per month) vary, but 1.5 million is a widely accepted figure within the research community. 

Although cocaine use had not significantly changed over the six years prior to 1999, the number of first-time users went from 574,000 in 1991, to 934,000 in 1998 &amp;mdash; an increase of 63%. While these numbers indicated that cocaine is still widely present in the United States, cocaine use was significantly less prevalent than it was during the early 1980s. Cocaine use peaked in [[1982]] when 10.4 million Americans (5.6 percent of the population) reportedly used the drug.

====Usage among youth====
The [[1999]] [[Monitoring the future|Monitoring the Future]] (MTF) survey found the proportion of American students reporting use of powder cocaine rose during the 1990s. In [[1991]], 2.3 percent of eighth-graders stated that they had used cocaine in their lifetime. This figure rose to 4.7 percent in 1999. For the older grades, increases began in 1992 and continued through the beginning of 1999. Between those years, lifetime use of cocaine went from 3.3 percent to 7.7 percent for tenth-graders and from 6.1 percent to 9.8 percent for twelfth-graders. Lifetime use of crack cocaine, according to MTF, also increased among eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-graders, from an average of 2 percent in 1991 to 3.9 percent in 1999. 

Perceived risk and disapproval of cocaine and crack use both decreased during the 1990s at all three grade levels. The 1999 NHSDA found the highest rate of monthly cocaine use was for those aged 18&amp;ndash;25 at 1.7 percent, an increase from 1.2 percent in 1997. Rates declined between 1996 and 1998 for ages 26&amp;ndash;34, while rates slightly increased for the 12&amp;ndash;17 and 35+ age groups. Studies also show people are experimenting with cocaine at younger ages. NHSDA found a steady decline in the mean age of first use from 23.6 years in 1992 to 20.6 years in 1998.

====Availability====
Cocaine is readily available in all major U.S. metropolitan areas. According to the ''Summer 1998 Pulse Check'', published by the U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], cocaine use had stabilized across the country, with a few increases reported in [[San Diego]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. In the West, cocaine usage was lower, which was thought to be because some users were switching to [[methamphetamine]], which was cheaper and provides a longer-lasting high. Numbers of cocaine users are still very large, with a concentration among city-dwelling youth.

====Sources====
In [[1999]], [[Colombia]] was the world's leading producer of cocaine. Three-quarters of the world's annual yield of cocaine was produced there, both from cocaine base imported from [[Peru]] (primarily the [[Huallaga Valley]]) and [[Bolivia]], and from locally grown [[coca]]. There was a 28 percent increase in the amount of potentially harvestable [[coca]] plants in [[Colombia]] in [[1998]]. This, combined with crop reductions in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], made [[Colombia]] the nation with the largest area of coca under cultivation. Coca grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities, a use which is still present and is permitted by Colombian laws, only makes up a small fragment of total coca production, most of which is used for the illegal drug trade. Attempts to eradicate coca fields through the use of defoliants have devastated part of the farming economy in some coca growing regions of Colombia, and strains appear to have been developed that are more resistant or immune to their use.  Whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear. These strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown, increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine. The cultivation of coca has become an attractive, and in some cases even necessary, economic decision on the part of many growers due to the combination of several factors, including the persistence of worldwide demand, the lack of other employment alternatives, the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs, the eradication-related damages to non-drug farms, and the spread of new strains of the coca plant.

====Distribution====
Cocaine shipments from [[South America]] transported through [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]] are generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the [[US-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. The primary cocaine importation points in the [[United States]] are in [[Arizona]], southern [[California]], southern [[Florida]], and [[Texas]]. Typically, land vehicles are driven across the U.S.-Mexico border. 

Cocaine is also carried in small, concealed, kilogram quantities across the border by couriers known as “mules” (or “burros”), who enter the United States either legally through ports of entry or illegally through undesignated points along the border. Colombian traffickers have also started using a new concealment method whereby they add chemical compounds to cocaine hydrochloride to produce “black cocaine”. The cocaine in this substance is not detected by standard chemical tests or drug-sniffing canines.

Cocaine traffickers from [[Colombia]], and recently [[Mexico]], have also established a labyrinth of [[smuggling]] routes throughout the [[Caribbean]], the [[Bahama]] Island chain, and South [[Florida]]. They often hire traffickers from [[Mexico]] or the [[Dominican Republic]] to transport the drug. The traffickers use a variety of smuggling techniques to transfer their drug to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of 500&amp;ndash;700&amp;nbsp;kg in the [[Bahama Islands]] or off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]], mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of 500&amp;ndash;2,000&amp;nbsp;kg, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of [[Miami]].

Bulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western [[Caribbean]]&amp;ndash;[[Gulf of Mexico]] area. These vessels are typically 150&amp;ndash;250&amp;nbsp;foot (50&amp;ndash;80&amp;nbsp;m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations. In areas with a high volume of recreational traffic, smugglers use the same types of vessels, such as [[go-fast boat]]s, as those used by the local populations.

'''Codeine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''methylmorphine''' is an [[opioid]] used for its [[analgesic]], [[antitussive]] and antidiarrheal properties. It is marketed as the salts '''codeine sulfate''' and '''codeine phosphate'''.

Codeine is an [[alkaloid]] found in [[opium]] in concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 [[percent]]. While codeine can be extracted from opium, most codeine used in the [[United States]] is synthesized from [[morphine]] through the process of O-[[methylation]].

==Indications==
Approved indications for codeine include:
*[[Cough]], though its efficacy has been disputed (Schroeder &amp; Fahey, 2001)
*[[Diarrhea]]
*Mild to moderate [[pain]]

Codeine is sometimes marketed in combination preparations with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) as [[co-codamol]], with [[aspirin]] [[co-codaprin]] or with [[ibuprofen]]. These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent used singly (q.v. [[Synergy#Drug Synergism|Drug Synergy]]).

==Controlled substance==
In the [[United States]], codeine is regulated by the [[Controlled Substances Act]].  It is a Schedule II controlled substance for pain-relief products containing codeine alone.  In combination with aspirin or acetaminophen ([[paracetamol]]) it is listed as Schedule III.  Codeine is also available outside the United States as an [[over-the-counter_substance|over-the-counter medication]] (Schedule V) in liquid cough-relief formulations. Internationally, codeine is a Schedule II drug under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/yellow.pdf]

In the [[United Kingdom]], codeine is regulated by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]; it is a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971#Class B drugs|Class B Drug]].

In [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], codeine is regulated, however it is available without prescription in combination preparations from licensed pharmacists in doses up to 15&amp;nbsp;mg/tablets.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Codeine is considered a [[prodrug]], since it is metabolised ''[[in vivo]]'' to the principal active analgesic agent [[morphine]]. It is, however, less potent than morphine since only about 10% of the codeine is converted. It also has a correspondingly lower [[drug addiction|dependence]]-liability than morphine.

Theoretically, a dose of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;mg (oral) of codeine must be administered to give equivalent analgesia to 30&amp;nbsp;mg (oral) of morphine (Rossi, 2004). It is not used, however, in single doses of greater than 60mg (and no more than 240&amp;nbsp;mg in 24 hours) since there is a [[ceiling effect]].

The conversion of codeine to morphine occurs in the liver and is catalysed by the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. Approximately 6&amp;ndash;10% of the Caucasian population have poorly functional CYP2D6 and codeine is virtually ineffective for analgesia in these patients (Rossi, 2004). Many of the adverse effects, however, are still experienced. Also, some medications are CYP2D6 inhibitors and reduce or even completely eliminate the efficacy of codeine. The most notorious of these are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, such as [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) and [[citalopram]] (Celexa).

==Pharmacology==
{{main|opioid receptor}}

Codeine itself has weak affinity for the [[opioid receptor#The μ-opioid receptor|&amp;mu;-opioid receptor]]. Its principal analgesic actions are mediated by the affinity of morphine for the &amp;mu;-opioid receptor, though other therapeutic and adverse effects are produced by activation of other opioid receptors.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of codeine include: Itching, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dry mouth, [[miosis]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], urinary retention and constipation. (Rossi, 2004)

Tolerance to many of the effects of codeine develop with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance.

A potentially serious ADR, as with other opioids, is [[respiratory depression]]. This depression is dose-related and is the mechanism for the potentially fatal consequences of overdose.

==Recreational use==
Codeine is often used as a [[recreational drug]]. This may be due to its easy availability [[over-the-counter]] or on [[prescription]] in combination products (which, in the certain countries, are scheduled lower than codeine as a single-agent). People use it in order to obtain the [[euphoria|euphoric]] effects associated with use of opioids.
* In certain areas of the United States; more specifically Texas, codeine syrup form is called '''Lean'''.  It is commonly mixed with alcohol, or a [[Blunt_%28drug_culture%29|blunt]] and smoked.  It has been said this is done because it makes you &quot;lean&quot;.
* In some countries, cough syrups and tablets containing codeine are available without prescription; people will frequently purchase it from multiple pharmacies so as not to incur suspicions. It is reported that in [[France]], 95% of the consumption of ''Néo-codion'' cough preparation, containing codeine, cannot be attributed to medical use, but is rather used as a substitute for [[heroin]].
* In the [[United Kingdom]], people purchase tablets which combine codeine and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and consume these at higher-than-recommended doses, without apparent concern of the hepatotoxicity associated with large doses of paracetamol. Some may try to [[extraction|extract]] the codeine from the paracetamol through various methods, the most common and simplest being the [[cold water extraction]].
* While the combination of codeine with [[paracetamol]], at higher-than-recommended doses, can possibly cause hepatotoxicity ([[liver]] damage), combination with [[ibuprofen]] can result in [[kidney]] problems/failure and additional [[stomach]] pain and [[nausea]] and combination with [[aspirin]] can lead to internal [[hemorrhage|hemorrhaging]], particularly [[gastrointestinal]] hemorrhage.

Certain codeine products are encountered on the illicit market, frequently in combination with [[carisoprodol]].  Combinations of codeine and glutethimide (Doriden) used to be fairly commonplace, but are almost unheard of today, due to the withdrawal of glutethimide products from the marketplace in the US and almost all other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Cartesian''''' means relating to the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[René Descartes|Descartes]], who, among other things, worked to merge [[algebra]] and [[Euclidean geometry]]. This work was influential in the development of [[analytic geometry]], [[calculus]], and [[cartography]].

The idea of this system was developed in [[1637]] in two [[writing]]s by Descartes. In [[Discourse on Method]], in part two, he introduces the new idea of specifying the position of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or object on a surface, using two intersecting axes as measuring guides. In [[La Géométrie]], he further explores the above-mentioned concepts.

== Two-dimensional coordinate system ==

The modern Cartesian [[coordinate system]] in two dimensions (also called a '''rectangular coordinate system''') is commonly defined by two axes, at [[right angle|right angles]] to each other, forming a plane (an ''xy''-plane).  The [[horizontal]] axis is labeled ''x'', and the [[vertical]] axis is labeled ''y''.  In a three dimensional coordinate system, another axis, normally labeled ''z'', is added, providing a sense of a third dimension of space measurement. The axes are commonly defined as mutually orthogonal to each other (each at a right angle to the other).  (Early systems allowed &quot;oblique&quot; axes, that is, axes that did not meet at right angles.) All the points in a Cartesian coordinate system taken together form a so-called '''Cartesian plane'''. Equations that use the Cartesian coordinate system are called '''Cartesian equations'''.

The point of intersection, where the axes meet, is called the ''origin'' normally labeled ''O''.
With the ''origin'' labeled ''O'', we can name the ''x'' axis ''Ox'' and the ''y'' axis ''Oy''.
The ''x'' and ''y'' axes define a plane that can be referred to as the ''xy'' plane.
Given each axis, choose a unit length, and mark off each unit along the axis, forming a grid.
To specify a particular point on a two dimensional coordinate system, you indicate the ''x'' unit first ('''abscissa'''), followed by the ''y'' unit ('''ordinate''') in the form ''(x,y)'', an ordered pair.
In three dimensions, a third ''z'' unit ('''applicate''') is added, ''(x,y,z)''.

The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values.  The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values.

An example of a [[point_(spatial)|point]] ''P'' on the system is indicated in the picture below using the coordinate (3,5).

[[Image:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|400px]]

The arrows on the axes indicate that they extend forever in the same direction (i.e. infinitely).  
The intersection of the two x-y axes creates four quadrants indicated by the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV.  Conventionally, the quadrants are labeled counter-clockwise starting from the northeast quadrant.  In Quadrant I the values are (''x'',''y''), and II:(-''x'',''y''), III:(-''x'',-''y'') and IV:(''x'',-''y'').  (see table below.)

{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=40%
 |-
 ! Quadrant !! x-values !! y-values
 |- align=center
 | I   || &gt; 0 || &gt; 0
 |- align=center
 | II  || &lt; 0 || &gt; 0
 |- align=center
 | III || &lt; 0 || &lt; 0
 |- align=center
 | IV  || &gt; 0 || &lt; 0
 |}

== Three-dimensional coordinate system ==
Sometime in the early [[19th century]] the third dimension of measurement was added, using the ''z''-axis.

[[Image:Cartesian coordinates 3D.png]]

The coordinates in a three dimensional system are of the form ''(x,y,z)''.  An example of two [[point_(spatial)|point]]s plotted in this system are in the picture above, points ''P''(3,0,5) and ''Q''(&amp;minus;5,&amp;minus;5,7).  Notice that the axes are depicted in a world-coordinates orientation with the ''z''-axis pointing up.

The ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-coordinates of a point (say ''P'') can also be taken as the distances from the ''yz''-plane, ''xz''-plane, and ''xy''-plane respectively. The figure below shows the distances of point P from the planes.

[[Image:Coor planes Color.png|400px]]

The ''xy''-, ''yz''-, and ''xz''-planes divide the three-dimensional space into eight subdivisions known as [[octant]]s, similar to the quadrants of 2D space.  While conventions have been established for the labeling of the four quadrants of the ''x'-''y'' plane, only the first octant of three dimensional space is labeled.  It contains all of the points whose ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' coordinates are positive.  That is, no point in the first octant has a negative coordinate.
The three dimensional coordinate system provides the physical dimensions of space &amp;mdash; height, width, and length, and this is often referred to as &quot;the three dimensions&quot;.  It is important to note that a dimension is simply a measure of something, and that, for each class of features to be measured, another dimension can be added.  Attachment to visualizing the dimensions precludes understanding the many different dimensions that can be measured (time, mass, color, cost, etc.).  It is the powerful insight of Descartes that allows us to manipulate multi-dimensional object algebraically, avoiding compass and protractor for analyzing in more than three dimensions.

=== Orientation and &quot;handedness&quot; ===
The three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system presents a problem.  Once the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are specified, they determine the [[line (mathematics)|line]] along which the ''z''-axis should lie, but there are two possible directions on this line.  The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'.

The origin of these names is a trick called the [[right-hand rule]] (and the corresponding left-hand rule).  If the forefinger of the right hand is pointed forward, the middle finger bent inward at a right angle to it, and the thumb placed a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative directions of the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes respectively in a ''right-handed'' system.  Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.

The right-handed system is universally accepted in the physical sciences, but the left-handed is also still in use.

[[image:Coordinate system handedness.PNG|center|frame|The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.]]

If a point plotted with some coordinates in a right-handed system is replotted with the same coordinates in a left-handed system, the new point is the mirror image of the old point about the ''xy''-plane.
[[image:Right_hand_cartesian.JPG|center|frame|The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes.]]

More ambiguity occurs when a three-dimensional coordinate system must be drawn on a two-dimensional page.  Sometimes the ''z''-axis is drawn diagonally, so that it seems to point out of the page.  Sometimes it is drawn vertically, as in the above image (this is called a ''world coordinates'' orientation).

== Further notes ==
In [[analytic geometry]] the Cartesian coordinate system is the foundation for the algebraic manipulation of geometrical shapes.  Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes.  One common set of systems use [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]]; astronomers often use [[spherical coordinates]], a type of polar coordinate system.  In different branches of mathematics coordinate systems can be transformed, translated, rotated, and re-defined altogether to simplify calculation and for specialized ends.

It may be interesting to note that some have indicated that the master artists of the [[Renaissance]] used a grid, in the form of a wire mesh, as a tool for breaking up the component parts of their subjects they painted--a [[trade secret]].  That this may have influenced Descartes is merely speculative.  (See [[perspective]], [[projective geometry]].)

[[Image:Glendalefreeway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The soaring ramps in the stack interchanges favored by Caltrans often provide stunning views.]]
'''Caltrans''' (full name: '''California Department of Transportation''') is a [[government]] agency in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Its mission is to improve mobility across the state. Caltrans does more than manage the State highway system; it is also actively involved with [[public transportation]] systems in California.

For administrative purposes, Caltrans has divided the state of California into 12 districts supervised by district offices.  Most districts cover multiple [[county|counties]]; District 12 ([[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) is the only district with one county.  The largest districts are District 4 ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and District 7 ([[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties).

Caltrans has a reputation for being both innovative and stubbornly idiosyncratic.  In 1950, it developed the typeface family now used nationwide on road signs (though not its 2004 replacement, [[Clearview_(typeface)|Clearview]]).  It pioneered [[Botts dots]] as a superior form of [[lane]] marking. It has frequently been criticized for proposing and often constructing ugly bridges and has several times been forced to redesign such structures in response to public outcry. It has long experimented with freeway-to-freeway stack [[Road junction|interchange]]s of increasing height and complexity.  It was the last state highway department in the [[United States]] to number its [[freeway]] exits (the [[Cal-NExUS]] program), and one of the last to switch from dark green &quot;button copy&quot; signs to bright green reflective signs.  In the 1990s, Caltrans aggressively added [[carpool lane]]s on freeways to reduce [[traffic congestion]].  

Although state highways generally adhere to consistent minimum design standards throughout much of the state, there are some policy and construction differences between the northern and southern district offices.  For example, [[Northern California]] [[carpool]] lanes are always directly adjacent to mainline traffic lanes and are restricted to carpools only during weekday commute hours, while [[Southern California]] carpool lanes are always separated from mainline lanes (except at designated entrance/exit areas) and most are restricted at all times.

'''The Continuation War''' was fought between [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], from the [[Soviet]] bombing attacks on [[June 25]], [[1941]], to [[cease-fire]] [[September 4]], [[1944]] (on the Finnish side) and [[September 5]] (on the Soviet side). The [[United Kingdom]] declared war on Finland on [[December 6]], 1941, but did not participate actively. Material support from, and military cooperation with, [[Germany]] was critical for Finland's struggle with its larger neighbour. The war was formally concluded by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty]] of [[1947]].

[[Image:Continuation-War-1941.png|right|thumb|300px|Relative strengths of Finnish, German and Soviet troops at the start of the Continuation War in June 1941.]]

The Continuation War (''jatkosota'' in [[Finnish (language)|Finnish]], ''Fortsättningskriget'' in [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]) is so named in Finland to make clear its relationship to the [[Winter War]] ([[November 30]], [[1939]], to [[March 12]], [[1940]]). Seen from a Russian perspective, it was merely one of the fronts of the [[Great Patriotic War]]. The war was, however, considered separate from the World War by Finland &amp;ndash; an understanding not quite appreciated by the political leadership in Germany, Finland's chief supporter. 

== Introduction ==
Although the Continuation War was fought on the periphery of [[World War II]] and the troops engaged were relatively few, its history is intriguing as it challenges both conventional wisdom about the moral clarity of the Allied effort and the popular and academic theory that democratic countries do not wage war against each other. Technically, the democratic Allied powers declared war against [[Finland]]. But there were no engagements with troops of the chief democratic powers, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].

During the conflict, Finland acted in concert with [[Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]], which in turn was allied with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and, for most of the period, the [[United States]]. Memories of the 1939 [[Winter War]] with the Soviet Union, and the inability of the Allies to support the Finns in it, were key motivators for the alliance with Germany.

The issue was less controversial in Finland, and in hindsight a relatively broad Finnish consensus asserts that the Finns as a people would most likely not have survived the war without cooperating with Nazi Germany. Conventional wisdom among Finns who grew up in the [[1960s]]&amp;ndash;[[1970s|70s]] depicted the Continuation War as a ''Finnish'' mistake. Nowadays, some tend to assert that there was really nothing Finland could have done to avoid the Winter War and the Continuation War &amp;mdash; at least not in the last years before the wars.

Major events of World War II, and the tides of war in general, had significant impact on the course of the Continuation War:
* Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]) is closely connected to the Continuation War's beginning.
* The [[Allied]] invasion of [[France]] ([[Battle of Normandy]]) was coordinated with the Soviet major offensive against Finland ([[June 9]]&amp;ndash;[[July 15]], [[1944]]), leading to a five week long [[military alliance|alliance]] between democratic Finland and Germany ([[June 26]] to [[August 4]], [[1944]]).
* The subsequent US/Soviet race to Berlin brought about the end of the Continuation War by rendering [[Northern Europe]] irrelevant.

== Aims of war ==
Finland's main goal during [[World War II]] was, although nowhere literally stated, to survive the war as an independent [[state|country]], capable of maintaining its sovereignty in a politically hostile environment. Specifically for the Continuation War, Finland aimed at reversing its territorial losses under the March 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] and by extending the territory further east, to guarantee the survival of the [[Finnic]] brethren in [[East-Karelia]] &amp;mdash; thus in effect aiming at creating a [[Greater Finland]], as advocated by vociferous right-wing groups. Finland's exertion during the World War was, in the former respect, successful, although the price was high in war casualties, reparation payments, territorial loss, bruised international reputation and subsequent adaptation to Soviet international perspectives. 

The [[Soviet Union]]'s war goals are harder to assess on account of the secretive nature of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Soviet Union. The Soviet Union of the [[1930s]] was a militarily weak power, and it can be argued that all of her policies up to the Continuation War are best explained as defensive measures by offensive means: the sharing of [[Poland]] with [[Germany]], the annexation of the [[Baltic state]]s and the attempted invasion of Finland in the Winter War can all be seen as elements in the construction of a security zone between the perceived threat from the [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers of Western Europe and the [[Communism|Communist]] Soviet Union &amp;ndash; similar to the post-war establishment of [[Soviet satellite state]]s in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and the [[Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] concluded with post-war Finland. Accordingly, after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]], [[June 22]], [[1941]]), the [[Red Army]]'s attack on Finland, harbouring not yet unleashed German forces, could be seen as a [[pre-emptive war|pre-emptive]] or [[preventive attack|preventive]] attack aiming to protect Russian civilians and troops: through control of Finland's territory, the threat against Leningrad (i.e. the old imperial capital [[Saint Petersburg]]) and the important harbour in [[Murmansk]] was to be fended off.

== Background ==

=== Before World War II ===

Although [[East Karelia]] has never been part of [[Finland]], a majority of its inhabitants were Finnic people. After the Finnish declaration of independence, voices arose advocating the annexation of [[East Karelia]] to rescue it from oppression. This led to a few excursions to the area ([[Viena expedition]] and [[Aunus expedition]]), but these were unsuccessful. Finland unsuccessfuly raised the question of [[East Karelia]] several times in the [[League of Nations]].

In non-leftist circles, [[Imperial Germany]]'s role in the &quot;[[White Guard (Finland)|White]]&quot; government's victory over rebellious [[Socialist]]s during the [[Civil War in Finland]] was celebrated, although most preferred British or Scandinavian support over that of Germany. The security policy of independent Finland turned first towards a [[cordon sanitaire]], whereby the newly independent nations of [[Poland]], the [[Baltic Republics]] and Finland would form a defensive alliance against Russia, but after negotiations collapsed Finland turned to the [[League of Nations]] for security. Contacts with the Scandinavian countries also met with little success. In [[1932]], Finland and the [[Soviet Union]] signed a [[non-aggression pact]], but even contemporary analysts considered it worthless.

===The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the Winter War ===
{{main|Winter War}}

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] in [[1939]] enabled the [[Soviet Union]] to pressure the Baltic republics and Finland. The Baltic republics soon [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|gave in]] to Soviet demands, but Finland continued to refuse. As a result, on [[November 30]], [[1939]], the [[Winter War]] began. Condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and by countries all over the world had no effect on Soviet policy. International help to Finland was planned, but very little actual help materialised.

The [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] in [[1940]], which ended the [[Winter War]], was perceived as a great injustice. A fifth of the country's industry and 11% of agricultural land were lost. 12% of Finland's population had to be moved to the Finnish side of the border. [[Hanko]] was rented to Soviet Union as a military base. However, Finland had managed to force [[Soviet Union]] to give up its plan to annex the whole country.

=== Interim Peace ===
{{main|Interim Peace}}

The [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], in [[1940]], was a shock to the Finns. It was perceived as the ultimate failure of Finland's foreign policy, which had been based on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] guarantees for support. Binding [[bilateral]] treaties were now sought and formerly frosty relations, such as with the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Third Reich]], had to be eased. Public opinion in Finland longed for the re-acquisition of [[Finnish Karelia]], and put their hope in the peace conference that was assumed to would follow the World War. The term ''Välirauha'' (&quot;Interim Peace&quot;) became popular after the harsh peace was announced. 

Although the peace treaty was signed, the [[state of war]] and censorhsip was not revoked because of the widening world war, the difficult food supply situation, and the poor shape of the Finnish military. This made it possible for president [[Kyösti Kallio]] to ask [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Field Marshal Mannerheim]] to remain [[commander-in-chief]] and supervise rearmament and fortification work. During [[1940]], Finland received material purchased and donated during and immediately after the [[Winter War]]. Military expenditures rose in [[1940]] to 45% of Finland's state budget. A war trade treaty with Britain had little effect due to German occupation of [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]].

[[Nazi Germany]] attacked [[Scandinavia]] on [[April 9]], [[1940]]([[Operation Weserübung]]). Finland, like Sweden, was spared occupation but encircled by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]]. Especially damaging was the loss of [[fertilizer]] imports, that, together with he aftereffects of the [[Winter War]] resulted in a drastic fall of food production. Some of the deficit could be purchased from [[Sweden]] and some from the [[Soviet Union]], although delayed deliveries were a means to exert pressure on [[Finland]]. In this situation, Finland had no alternative but to turn to Germany.

From May [[1940]], Finland pursued a campaign to re-establish the good relations with Germany. The Finnish media not only refrained from criticism of [[Nazi Germany]], but also took active part in this campaign. Dissent was [[censorship|censored]]. After the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], the campaign was stepped up.

The implementation of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] created problems. The forced return of evacuated machinery, locomotives, and rail cars, inflexibility on questions which could have eased hardships created by the new border, such as fishing rights and the usage of [[Saimaa Canal]] heightened distrust about the objectives of the [[Soviet Union]]. The new Soviet ambassador to Helsinki, [[Ivan Zotov]] behaved undiplomatically and drived to advance Soviet interests in Finland. In his reports he recommended that Finland ought to be finished off and wholly annexed by the [[Soviet Union]].

On [[June 23]], [[1940]], the [[Soviet Union]] demanded mining rights in [[Petsamo]]. On [[June 27]], Moscow demanded demilitarization of [[Åland]]. After Sweden had signed the [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII)|troop transfer agreement]] with Germany on [[July 8]], [[Soviet Union]] demanded similar rights for a Soviet troop transit to [[Hanko]]. The transfer rights were given on [[September 6]], and demilitarization of Åland was agreed on [[October 11]], but negotiations on [[Petsamo]] continued to drag on. The Soviet Union also demanded several changes in the Finnish internal politics, for example forcing the resignation of [[Väinö Tanner]] from the cabinet. All of this reminded the public of how [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|the Baltic Republics had been occupied]] and annexed only a few months earlier. 

Unbeknownst to Finland, [[Adolf Hitler]] had started to plan invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Operation Barbarossa]]). He had not been interested in Finland before the [[Winter War]], but now he saw the value of Finland as an operating base, and perhaps also the military value of the [[Finnish army]]. In the first weeks of August, German fears of a likely immediate Russian attack on Finland caused Hitler to free the arms embargo. Negotiations were intitiated concerning German troop transfer rights in Finland in exchange for arms and other material. For the [[Third Reich]], this was a breach of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], as well as being for Finland a breach of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]. Soviet negotiators had insisted that the troop transfer agreement (to [[Hanko]]) should not be published making it easy for the Finns to keep [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII) |a troop transfer agreement with the Germans]] secret until the first German troops arrived.

=== Road to war ===

The negotiations about [[Petsamo]] [[nickel]] mining rights had dragged on for six months when the Soviet Foreign Ministry announced in January [[1941]] that the negotiations had to be concluded quickly. On the same day, the Soviet Union interrupted grain deliveries to Finland. Soviet ambassador Zotov was recalled home [[January 18]] and Soviet radio broadcasts started attacking Finland. Germans in Northern [[Norway]] reported in [[February 1]] that the [[Soviet Union]] had collected 500 fishing ships in [[Murmansk]], capable of transporting a division. Hitler ordered troops in [[Norway]] to occupy [[Petsamo]] ([[Operation Renntier]]) immediately if the [[Soviet Union]] started attacking Finland.

After the failure of the [[nickel]] negotiations, diplomatic activities were halted for a few months. The period did, however, saw increased German interest in Finland.

German Foreign Ministry sent [[Ludwig Weissauer]] to Finland [[May 5]], this time to clarify that war between Germany and the Soviet Union would not be launched before spring [[1942]]. Finnish leadership believed that at least officially, and forwarded the message to the Swedes and the British. When the war broke out only a couple of weeks later, it was understandable that both Swedish and British governments felt that the Finns had lied to them. 

In the spring of [[1941]] joint battle plans were discussed with Germany, as well as communications and securing sea lanes. Finland made significant request for material aid. Finland was willing to join Germany against Soviet union with someprerequisites: a guarantee of Finnish independence, the pre-Winter War borders (or better), continuing grain deliveries, and that Finnish troops would not cross the border before a Soviet incursion. The arrival of German troops participating in [[Operation Barbarossa]] began on [[June 7]] in [[Petsamo]].

[[Finnish parliament]] was informed for the first time on [[June 9]], when first mobilization orders were issued for troops needed to safeguard the following general mobilization phases. On [[June 20]] Finland's government ordered 45,000 people at the Soviet border to be evacuated. On [[June 21]] Finland's chief of the General Staff, [[Erik Heinrichs]], was finally informed by his German counterpart that the attack was to begin.


== Finnish Offensive 1941 ==

[[Image:Finnish advance in Karelia during the Continuation War.png|300px|thumb|The furthest advance of Finnish units in the Continuation War. Borders for both before and after the Winter War are shown.]]

[[Operation Barbarossa]] had already commenced in the northern Baltic by the late hours of [[June 21]], when German minelayers, which had been hiding in the Finnish archipelago, laid two large minefields across the [[Gulf of Finland]]. These minefields ultimately proved sufficient to confine the Soviets' [[Baltic Fleet]] to the easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland. Later the same night, German bombers, flew along the Gulf of Finland to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and mined the harbour and the river [[Neva]]. On the return trip, these bombers refuelled in [[Utti]] airfield. Finland feared that the [[Soviet Union]] would occupy [[Åland]] so [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus]] (Sail Race) was launched in the early hours of [[June 22]] to occupy [[Åland]]. Soviet bombers launched attacks against Finnish ships during the operation but no damage was inflicted.

On the morning of June 22, the German [[Gebirgskorps Norwegen]] started [[Operation Renntier]] and began its move from Northern [[Norway]] to [[Petsamo]]. Finland did not allow direct German attacks from its soil to the Soviet Union, so German forces in Petsamo and Salla had to hold their fire. There were occasional individual and group level small arms shooting between Soviet and Finnish border guards, but otherwise the front was quiet.

After three days, early on the morning of [[June 25]], the Soviet Union unleashed a major air offensive against 18 cities with 460 planes, mainly striking airfields but seriously damaging civilian targets as well. The Soviet Union justified the attack as being directed against German targets in Finland, but even the British embassy had to admit that this was not so. A meeting of parliament was scheduled for [[June 25]] when Prime Minister Rangell had been due to present a notice about Finland's neutrality in the Soviet-German war, but the Soviet bombings led him to instead observe that Finland was once again at war with the Soviet Union. The Continuation War had begun.

Mobilized units started moving towards the border on June 21, and they were arranged into defensive formations as soon as they arrived at the border.  Finland was able to mobilize 16 infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and two &quot;[[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]&quot; brigades, which were practically normal infantry brigades, except for one battalion in the 1st Jaeger Brigade (1.JPr), which was armoured using captured Soviet equipment. There were also a handful of separate battalions, mainly formed from Border Guard units and used mainly for reconnaissance. Soviet military plans has estimated that the Finns would be able to mobilize only 10 infantry divisions, as they had done in the Winter War, but they failed to take into account material the Finns had purchased between the wars and the training of all available men. In northern Finland there were also two German Mountain Divisions at Petsamo and two German Infantry divisions at Salla. Another German infantry division was en route through Sweden to Ladoga Karelia, although one reinforced regiment was later redirected from it to Salla.

When the war started, the Soviet Union had [[Soviet 23rd Army|23rd Army]] in Karelian Isthmus consisting of [[Soviet 50th Corps|50th]] and [[Soviet 19th Corps|19th Corps]] and [[Soviet 10th Mechanized Corps|10th Mechanized Corps]], together with 5 Infantry, 1 Motorized and 2 Armored divisions. At Ladoga Karelia there was the [[Soviet 7th Army|7th Army]] consisting of 4 Infantry divisions. In Murmansk-Salla region the Soviet Union had [[Soviet 14th Army|14th Army]] with [[Soviet 42nd Corps|42nd Corps]], consisting of 5 Infantry divisions (1 as reserve in [[Archangelsk]]) and 1 Armored division. Also the Soviets had around 40 battalions, separate regiments and fortification units which were not part of their divisional structure. In Leningrad there were 3 Infantry divisions and one Mechanized Corps.

The initial German strike against the Soviet Air Force had not touched air units located near Finland, so the Soviets could field nearly 750 Air Force planes and part of the 700 planes the Soviet Navy had against 300 Finnish planes.

The Soviet war against Germany did not go as well as pre-war Soviet war games had envisioned, and soon Soviet high command had to take units from wherever they could, so although Soviets had started the war against Finland, they could not follow the initial air offensive with a supporting land offensive.  They also had to withdraw the 10th Mechanized Corps with two armoured divisions and [[Soviet 237th Infantry division|237th Infantry division]] from Ladoga Karelia thus stripping reserves from defending units.

=== Reconquest of Ladoga Karelia ===
Initially the Finnish army was deployed in a defensive posture, but on [[June 29]] Mannerheim created the [[Army of Karelia]], commanded by Lt. Gen. Heinrichs, and ordered it to prepare to attack Ladoga Karelia. The Army of Karelia consisted of [[Finnish VI Corps (Continuation War)|VI Corps]] ([[Finnish 5th Division (Continuation War)|5th]] and [[Finnish 11th Division (Continuation War)|11th Divisions]]), [[Finnish VII Corps (Continuation War)|VII Corps]] ([[Finnish 7th Division (Continuation War)|7th]] and [[Finnish 9th Division (Continuation War)|9th divisions]]) and [[Group O]] ([[Finnish Cavalry Brigade|Cavalry Brigade]], [[1st Jaeger Brigade]] and [[2nd Jaeger Brigade]]). Also later when 1. division and two regiments of German 163. division arrived in the area, they were given to the Army of Karelia.

Opposing them were the Soviet [[Soviet 7th Army|7th Army]] with [[Soviet 168th Division|168th Division]] near Sortavala and [[Soviet 71st Division|71st Division]] north of [[Jänisjärvi]] (&quot;Hare Lake&quot;). Soviets had prepared field fortifications along the border across Sortavala and at the important road crossings at Värtsilä and Korpiselkä. 

On [[July 9]], the order for offensive was given. The duty to break through the Soviet defences was given to VI Corps, commanded by hero of [[Battle of Tolvajärvi]], Maj. Gen. [[Paavo Talvela]]. He had borrowed as much artillery as possible from other units of the Army of Karelia and even 1st Jaeger Brigade. (Col. [[Ruben Lagus]]) from Group O. With strong artillery support he unleashed 5th Division (Col. Koskimies) to Korpiselkä [[July 10]] and the defenders were overwhelmed by next morning. Talvela wasn't satisfied with the aggressiveness of Koskimies, and he relieved him from command and gave 5th Division to Col. Lagus.

Lagus pursued retreating Soviet IR 52 eastward with his light units and reached Tolvajärvi July 12. Then he turned southwards and advanced using small roads, some in such poor shape that men had to carry their bicycles. On July 14 his forces cut Sortavala-Petrozavodsk railroad, and next day they reached shores of Lake Ladoga, cutting Soviet routes around the lake. Soviets had to transfer two regiments and separate battalions from Karelian Isthmus to close down the hole on the eastern side of Lake Ladoga.

The 11th division (Col. Heiskanen) had already (by July 4) found that Soviet forces had temporarily abandoned their trenches across the border, and they used the opportunity to capture them. When the general offensive began, they had already (by July 9) pushed eastward from their captured positions over the roadless terrain and cut the road running from Korpiselkä to Värtsilä and Suistamo, on the eastern shore of Jänisjärvi. From there they threatened to encircle Soviet forces south of Korpiselkä and those fortified in Värtsilä. To prevent encirclement, the Soviets had to leave their positions and retreat eastward. Soviet IR 367 was able to hold its positions north of Jänisjärvi until defenders of Värtsilä had retreated there by July 12. Heiskanen continued pressing Soviet IR 367 around the eastern side of Jänistärvi, and reached Jänisjoki, running from Jänisjärvi to Lake Ladoga July 16, where they went on the defensive. 

Lagus continued his offensive immediately along the north-eastern coast of Lake Ladoga. Soviet Mot. IR 452 was coming from Karelian Isthmus and its first parts set to defensive at Salmi, where Tulemajoki reaches Lake Ladoga. Finns arrived there on July 18, and early next morning Finns started the battle by crossing the river 5km north of Salmi and managed to cut the roads leading to Salmi by afternoon. Next day Finns were able to push into the village and only small units were able to escape the encirclement. Salmi was finally captured by early hours of July 21.

The strengthened 5th division continued its advance as fast as possible and crossed the old border July 22 at Rajakontu. Meanwhile battle detachment under Järvinen (Col. Järvinen) had secured the left flank of the main thrust by crossing the old border at Känsäselkä and captured July 19 the villages of Kolatselkä and Palalahti by Tulemajärvi where they secured north and east leading roads and continued their advance to the south. And July 23 5th division from the west and detachment Järvinen from the north started their attack to Vitele village, which was captured next morning. Lagus unsuccessfully tried to encircle retreating Soviet forces and had by the evening reached Tuuloksenjoki but Soviet tanks and artillery managed to stop the advance of his light forces there.  

The 1st division (Col. Paalu) had arrived and was given to VI Corps July 16, but it was until July 20 when they reached the fast- moving front line and released attachment Järvinen to their attack towards Vitele. From there they continued attack north towards Hyrsylä and east toward Vieljärvi which it captured few days later. Soviet AR2, IR24, IR28 and parts of IR9 and IR10 started counteroffensive July 23, and after five days of fighting the front was established 10km east of Vieljärvi.

The Soviet North Front reorganized its forces at July 21 by transferring 168th division and one regiment from 71st division to 23rd Army, which was responsible for defence of Karelian Isthmus. The same day 7th Army was reorganized to two operative groups, Petrozavodsk Group (Lt. Gen. M. Antonjuk) with infantry regiment, two motorized regiments, one armoured regiment and separate units and South Group (Lt. Gen. V. Tsvetajev) with marine brigade, two motorized regiments and number of smaller units.

Also Mannerheim had recognized the situation and had already at July 19 ordered that attack must be stopped at Vitele-Vieljärvi line, as strong enemy formations were still on the southwestern side of Jänisjärvi and the fast advance had opened the Lake Ladoga coastline at the right flank of the 5th division and the defence has to be arranged.

The fears of Mannerheim were real, as July 19 Mj. Gen. Pavlov, commander of coastal defence of Lake Ladoga has ordered 4 Marine Brigade to conduct invasions behind Finnish defences.  During early hours of July 24, they landed successfully to Lunkulansaari and Mantsi, two islands right beside Salmi. All 11th, 5th and 1st divisions were committed at the time so Talvela had to scrape whatever forces he was able to get (including bridge building company) to throw attackers back to the lake. With the help of heavy artillery, which destroyed four of the fifteen ships Soviets were using, Finns were able to push marines to three separate mottis, and the attempt to reinforce these forces at the morning of July 25 was repulsed. One by one remaining mottis were destroyed. July 26 Soviets landed in Mantsi and this time they almost managed to capture the whole island before Talvela managed to reinforce forces there, and fighting continued in to the late night of July 27 when the last Soviet resistance ended.   

Finnish VII Corps (Mj. Gen. Hägglund) was ordered to attack at the right flank of VI Corps to Sortavala. The isthmus between Lake Ladoga and the Finnish border was quite narrow and the important rail junction of Matkaselkä was only ten kilometres from the border. So, it was no wonder that Soviets had started to fortify the border region, in depth, right after the Moscow Peace. These fortifications were the weakest at the northern section of the front, so Hägglund decided to put the main thrust there. There were concentrated 7th division (strengthened with pioneer units) and all Corps' artillery. The 19th division-south had to manage with only its internal artillery.

On the evening of July 10 the attack began.  As a heavy thunderstorm was raging at the area, it was decided that infantry would attack without artillery support so that surprise could be achieved. The plan succeeded and most Soviet forces were encircled in their pillboxes, which were then eliminated with artillery support. During the next day, 7th division advanced, encircling Soviet strongpoints.  By the morning of July 12, they managed to break through the region where Soviets had prepared minefields and fortifications. 

This proved to be only a short relief, as defending Soviet 168th division (Col. A. Bondarev) proved to be very capable in defence. Time after time, it created new minefields, dug strongpoints and trenches and skillfully evaded encircling Finnish units. The fight of the 168th division was later used as a textbook example for defensive fight in Soviet military schools.  

The 7th division reached the western shore of Jänisjärvi July 13 and turned southward. By July 15 they managed to reach the Sortavala-Petrozavodsk railroad at Pirttipohja and encircled defenders there.

The 19th division (Col. Hannuksela) had the unenvied duty to assault the best defended section of the 168th division. Hannuksela decided to create a very narrow and deep breach at Niinisyrjä village, only 200-300 meters wide and four kilometres deep, to breach the fortified border region. IR58 (Lt. Col. Juva) was to spearhead the assault which began late in the evening of July 10. IR58 fought all the night and next day advancing one and half kilometres. It became evident that they had insufficient artillery so they had to borrow artillery from II Corps. IR58 continued the attack and reached the end of border fortifications July 12. The Soviet 168th division counterattacked to close the breach and encircle the IR58, but Finns managed to hold the corridor, although Soviets managed to close its usage with artillery fire. Finnish IR16 (Col. M. Laurila), which followed IR58, managed to open the corridor by the morning of July 15.

The 7th division continued its attack July 15 eastward along the railroad. At July 17 they managed to breach Soviet defences at the isthmus between Jänisjärvi and Vahvajärvi. Meanwhile IR30 and IR51, of the 7th division, advanced east towards Jänisjoki, where they contacted the 11th division at the same day. IR30 and IR51 cleaned the western shore of Jänisjoki and reached Lake Ladoga by July 20, then started to clear islands at the front of Sortavala.

The IR37/7th division was ordered to advance westward at the southern coast of Vahvajärvi to contact the 19th division, trying to encircle enemies between the divisions. Bondarev recognized the situation and ordered retreat of the IR402. The 19th division had continued its attack southeast, and between July 18-25 the fierce encirclements and counter-encirclements raged before Finns managed to capture the main road and cut the railroad between Sortavala and Matkaselkä, which was captured July 18. Soviet managed to hold IR37 at Särkisyrjä village between July 18-19 and again at next Ilola village July 20-22, securing the retreat route of IR402. So by July 25 Soviet 168 Division had managed to straighten its front line to a geographically more defensible river (Kiteenjoki)-hills (Tirimäki, Okanmäki, Voinmäki)-river (Tohmajoki)-line.  

As Jänisjoki valley was cleared of the enemy, the remainder of the 7th division turned to the south-west. On July 25 they crossed Tohmajoki. The advancement was slow, as Soviets managed to hold their prepared strongpoints on hills, forcing Finns to encircle them. At July 28, 7 Division found a hole in Soviet defences and IR30/7 Division quickly poured through and captured Voinmäki. The advanced Finnish troops managed to ambush a car, which was transporting the Chief of Staff of Soviet 198 Division Lt. Col. Sinyk. The documents captured contained the order for a Soviet counterattack, which was to start next day, so all Finnish units were ordered to stop their offensive operations and prepare for defence.

The Soviet 23rd Army transferred 198 Division from Karelian Isthmus to Sortavala with an order to join the counteroffensive with 168 Division. The target of the attack was the recapture of the isthmus between Jänisjärvi and Lake Ladoga, as that would create a difficult situation for Finnish forces at the North side of the Lake Ladoga. When the offensive started July 29, it failed to gain ground anywhere, as available forces were too few against the Finns, and the captured information had given the Finns time to prepare for the offensive beforehand. Finns continued their offensive August 3 against the remaining Tirimäki and Okanmäki strongpoints (which prevented advancement towards Sortavala) and they were captured August 5.

Meanwhile Finnish II Corps had started its own offensive July 31 at the narrowest point between Lake Ladoga and the Finnish border and quickly managed to break through Soviet defences and advanced towards the coast of Lake Ladoga, threatening Soviet forces with encirclement. The Soviet 23rd Army cancelled the offensive and ordered 198 Division southward for a counteroffensive against advancing Finnish II Corps. 168 Division was ordered to withdraw towards Lake Ladoga starting August 5. Soviet IR367 was given the responsibility to defend Sortavala.

Although Sortavala was militarily insignificant, and had been neutralized when Finns captured islands which controlled access to Lake Ladoga on July 27, it was politically important.  So, instead of pursuing 168 Division relentlessly, Finns concentrated forces to capture the city. On August 12 Sortavala was reached by 7 Division and the city was cleared of Soviets at August 15. Only small groups of defending soldiers managed to escape from the city.

Finnish II Corps had cut railroads between Viipuri and Sortavala August 6, and on August 8 Mannerheim formed the new I Corps from 19 Division, 7 Division and 2 Division, with the task to clear the western shore of Lake Ladoga. The II Corps reached Lake Ladoga August 8 at Lahdenpohja, (thus capturing the harbour 168 Division had been instructed to use for evacuation on July 23).

Soviet 168 Division, with a number of separate regiments and battalions, continued its retreat towards the shores of Lake Ladoga, with Finnish 2 Division pressing from the south-west and 19 Division from the north, while 7 Division continued its offensive against Sortavala. On August 17, Soviets controlled only a 12 km wide and 10 km deep bridgehead, but during the following days Soviets concentrated naval and air units to protect the evacuation of 168 Division and other units. This evacuation was a great success, and Finns could only capture small booty from the motti, including 40 artillery pieces, 8 tanks, 310 cars, 35 tractors and 1500 live or dead horses. 

At the northern side of the Finnish main offensive group, Oinonen, with the Cavalry Brigade and 2 Jaeger Brigade, was ordered to advance to the old border. Opposing them was parts of IR52/71 Division, 80 Border Guard detachment and IR126/71 Division, which was commanded by Maj. Valli (a Finnish-born communist who emigrated to the Soviet Union during the Finnish Civil War).  Many Karelian, Ingern and Finnish-born communists served in its ranks, as well as many veterans from Kuusinen's people's army of the Winter War.

The probing attacks started on July 7, then the main attack started, with the southernmost 2 J. Br. reaching Tolvajärvi by July 14. From there the brigade started a northern encirclement towards Ägläjärvi. The attack of the Cav. Br. didn't succeed as well, and the Finns were forced to encircle well prepared Soviet hill-forts, which Finns were unable to capture directly, due to lack of artillery and air support.   

By that time German 163 Division (Lt. Gen. Engelbrecht) (lacking one brigade and part of the artillery, which was diverted to Salla during transport) had reached the front at Tolvajärvi and tried to breach Soviet positions there on July 21, with only one brigade, but failed as their opponents turned out to be stronger than expected. 

A new offensive started July 25, when two battalions from German IR310 and one from Finnish IR56 started attacking along the railroad, near the Näätäoja station. At Tolvajärvi, Engelbrecht decided to use the route 2 J. Br. had opened, and ordered them, and one German infantry battalion from IR307, to capture Ägläjärvi village, to sever the Soviet supply route to Tolvajärvi. The attack failed and Soviets managed to keep the road open through Ägläjärvi, although they lost a supply depot during fighting.

Lt. Gen. Engelbrecht exchanged Cav. Br. with a couple of infantry battalions which were ordered in defence, and ordered Cav. Br. to cut the road between Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi, by advancing through the forests. The attack started August 2 and by August 4 they reached the road and started advancing towards Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi. On August 3, 2 J. Br. and German I/IR307 started attacking Ägläjärvi village, which they captured on August 5. On August 6 they contacted Cav. Br. south of Ägläjärvi. The Soviets continued their retreat to Aittojoki, where they blew up the bridges and dug in. Also, their northern forces feared encirclement from Ägläjärvi, and left their fortified positions there August 8, retreating east of Kuolismaa.

On July 20, 11 Division had been relieved from Jänisjoki and it was moved first to the reserve and then to the area between German 163 Division and 1 Division, against Hyrsylä, on August 11. The Soviets reinforced their forces in the area with the new 272 Division, August 10, and they immediately started attacking towards Vieljärvi against Finnish 1 Division, but they managed, in only a few places, to advance two kilometres in five days, before the attack was stopped.

On August 19, 11 Division started the attack from Hyrsylä northwards and reached Petrozavodsk railroad, and the main road, the next day. From there they continued northeast towards Suvilahti, which they captured August 21, and northwards towards Tsalkki, the location of the last usable supply road for Soviet defenders. Also on August 19, 2 J. Br., Cav. Br. and German IR307 stormed over the Aittojoki. Cav. Br. tried to encircle defending Soviet forces, but recognized their precarious situation and quickly withdrew, managing to retreat most of their forces eastward before the 11 Division cut their retreat route at Tsalkki on August 23. With the capture of Suojärvi, the last town in Ladoga Karelia had been reconquered.

=== Reconquest of Karelian Isthmus ===
Between the Army of Karelia and Gulf of Finland there were three Finnish corps: II Corps (2.D, 15.D and 18.D) north of river [[Vuoksi]], V Corps (10.D) and IV Corps (4.D, 12.D and 8.D) defending the coast. At the Soviet side there were XIX Corps (142.D, 115.D), L Corps (43.D, 123.D), X Mechanized Corps (21.Armored D, 24.Arm.D. and 198.Mech.D) in reserve and division strength 22. Fortification Area, which defended the coast. The Soviet X Mechanized Corps were transferred at the end of June from Karelian Isthmus to southwest of Leningrad to defend against advancing Germans but left 198.D as only reserve to Soviet forces. The Finnish V Corps were disbanded and 10.D were attached first to IV Corps (Lt.Gen. [[Karl Lennart Oesch]]) and late July to II Corps (Mj.Gen. [[Taavetti Laatikainen]]) as a reserve. Both parties were first on defensive, and only small, company or battalion size probing attacks were made both sides to improve own positions. The loss of reserves prompted Soviets to retreat to more defensible lines at the nothernmost part of the front and continued fortifying in depth, creating concrete and wooden strongpoints, digging trenches and laying minefields, although the Finns advanced to keep contact with enemy. The quiet lasted until [[July 31]], when Finnish offensive began.

The Soviet fortification works had been concentrated near river Vuoksi and along the roads, so Finns concentrated their forces to narrow, deep breakthroughs over the roadless terrains which were supported by pioneers building temporary supply roads through the forests and over the swamps. The 18.D (Col. Pajari) attacked through the forest against the northernmost section of Soviet 115.D and instead of following roads they secured a roadcrossing and advanced again over the forest to the next road where they did the same. The roadcrossings were occupied by stronger units, which had to defend against several armor supported Soviet counterattacks. During one of those counterattacks private [[Vilho Rättö]] captured Soviet AT gun and aiming through the barrel he managed to destroy four enemy tanks, earning him the first [[Mannerheim Cross]] granted to a private. Finally at August 4 Finns managed to encircle and capture Ilmee road crossing thus forcing Soviets abandon their prepared positions between Ilmee and the border. The main thrust of 15.D (Col. Hersalo) was against Soviet IR588/142.D, and concentrated the thrust against only two kilometer wide section, where most of the artillery was concentrated. After breaching the border fortifications, they advanced five kilometers through the forest before coming to the road thus bypassing Soviet defences, which were encircled and captured one by one by forces coming behind the leading elements. After six days advance 15.D was only three kilometers from the Viipuri-Sortavala railroad and 15km from the western corner of Lake Ladoga and close to encircling Soviet forces on its left side. The 2.D (Col. Blick) decided to encircle two battalions of Soviet IR461 which were defending Tyrjä village by encircling the village from east and pushing the defenders to Lake Tyrjänjärvi by using IR7/2.D while IR28/2.D passed the village and advanced southwards. While supported by artillery the Soviets managed to hold on four days, before the encirclement was complete. Some of the men were able to escape through the forests, but most of them and all their heavy equipment were trapped to the village. Also Finns suffered heavy casualties in the fighting and the IR7 received the nickname ''Tyrjän rykmentti'' (Regiment of Tyrjä). The capture of Tyrjä opened road towards Elisenvaara railway crossing and at August 5 first Finnish units reached Viipuri-Sortavala railroad.  

The commander of Soviet 23. Army, Lt.Gen. M. Gerasimov ordered August 4 198.D to cease its counterattack near Sortavala and move south to attack advancing 2.D together with 142.D. Meanwhile 115.D and 43.D should tie Finnish reserves. Unfortunately this wasn't sufficient and 115.D retreated to river Helisevänjoki, where hills and a river formed good defensive positions against attacking 18.D. The 18.D advanced to river Helisevänjoki and reached Viipuri Sortavala railroad at Inkilä roadcrossing at August 8. The 10.D (Col. Sihvo) was ordered to advance between 15.D and 18.D and at August 6 they reached Viipuri Sortavala railroad. 10.D continued attack towards Käkisalmi Hiitola railroad, but Soviet forces managed to keep railroad and road open until August 8, when 10.D captured Hiitola village and when the first troops of 10.D reached Lake Ladoga next day the last land connection to Soviet troops defending the northwest coast of Lake Ladoga was severed. Soviets tried to open the connection with strong counterattacks during August 10 and 11 but were unsuccessful.

Meanwhile IR28/2.D had captured Elisenvaara railway junction August 9 thus opening supply routes through railways from Finland. After the battle of Tyrjä IR7/2.D rested two days as division reserve before continuing attack along railroad towards Lahdenpohja town, which it captured August 8, thus dividing Soviet forces in the forming bridgehead. At the same day, 2.D was transferred to new I Corps with an order to clear northern Soviet bridgehead. It was left to 15.D and 10.D to clear southern bridgehead where Soviet 142.D and 198.D were ordered to withdraw to Kilpolansaari island for naval transport. This withdrawal was executed orderly and Finns couldn't encircle any bigger enemy formations. At August 11 15.D captured Hiitola railway junction, and at August 13 all Soviet forces have retreated to Huiskonniemi peninsula and Kilpolansaari island. With total superiority in air Soviets managed to withdraw almost all the men and material from the bridgehead and at August 23 15.D, which was left to press Soviets, had cleared all remaining rearguards from the island. 

Soviet intention was to start large counteroffensive at August 10, and 23. Army had received 265.D reinforcements to Räisälä area. The offensive was to be directed against 18.D and 10.D with the target to open roads to encircled forces on northwest coast of lake Ladoga. By coindicent the 18.D had been resting and received order to continue advance on the same day, so when the Soviet attack started at Inkilä, Finns in turn started their own only 5km westwards. While the Soviet attack failed to gain ground, Finnish attack managed to cut Soviets' main supply route and subsequent Finnish counterattack forced Soviet forces to retreat southwards while fighting delaying action and first Finnish troops reached River Vuoksi at August 14 at [[Antrea]], where they continued clearing the left shore of the river. Soviets started to move forces from southwestern side of Viipuri to defend Enso and to counterattack to Antrea at August 16, but when the attack failed, the Soviets were forced to evacuate northern shore at August 21. At the eastern side Finns advanced southeastward and reached Vuosalmi at August 17 and northern outlet of river Vuoksi at August 18. Finns crossed immediately River Vuoksi unopposed few kilometers west of Vuosalmi at August 17, and by August 20 they had secured the beachhead.  

The Soviet counterattack against 10.D started August 14 and it managed to push Finns 2km northwards before Finnish reinforcements managed to stop it. The 10.D left the coast of Lake Ladoga to IR36/15.D and concentrated all of its forces against Soviet 265.D at Räisälä. At August 15 the 10.D started its own attack in which it encircled Soviet defenders in Räisälä at August 17 and captured it next day. From there it continued cleaning the left bank of northern outlet of River Vuoksi. At August 19 IR43/10.D continued attack southward and reached Lake Suvanto at August 21. From there it continued eastward with IR1/10.D. This threatened all Soviet forces north of Vuoksi with encirclement and they started retreating from Käkisalmi which was captured at August 21. The attack continued southward and as only small border guard units were capable to delay attackers, River Taipaleenjoki and the shore of Lake Ladoga was reached at August 23, but Finnish troops were unable to cross river on the move.     

STAVKA recognized the serious situation, and ordered at August 20 retreat to the new, unprepared defence line running from the southwest side of Viipuri northwards to river Vuoksi and along it to Lake Suvanto and through River Taipaleenjoki to Lake Ladoga. This decision shortened frontline considerably, but it also meant abandoning defensive installations they had prepared last months along the border. The Finns were preparing to start their own attack along the southernmost stretch of the border at, so when they notice Soviets leaving their positions at August 21, they were ordered for immediate pursuit. Althought Soviet 43.D (Mj.Gen. V. Kirpitsnikov) managed to man new positions north and west of Viipuri, they were unable to prevent Finnish 12.D (Col. Vihma) to advance along the right bank of River Vuoksi and contact 18.D, which was enlarging their beachhead at Vuosalmi, and at the evening of August 22 the whole right bank was in Finnish hands. Soviet 123.D (Mj.Gen. F. Aljabusev) was defending the southwest side of Viipuri. Much of the troops of 123.D and of the 115.D (Mj.Gen. Konjkov) which had retreated from upper Vuoksi were still unorganized due to fast retreat from their positions. The Finnish 4.D (Col. Viljanen) advanced along the [[Saimaa Canal]], pressing Soviet 43.D from north. By August 23 the southernmost Finnish division, 8.D (Col. Winell), had cleared the western shore of the [[Bay of Viipuri]] up to the River Ykspäänjoki, and started to prepare the crossing of the bay.

During August 23 Finns had manged to advance from the east to 8km from Viipuri, but at the morning of August 24 Soviet 123.D and 115.D stated counteroffensive against Finnish forces east of Viipuri, propably trying to capture initiative and force Finns back to the northern side of River Vuoksi. Using heavy artillery fire Soviets managed to push defending Finns at places over 5km backwards, but they didn't manage to create breaches to the front, and when the reserve of 12.D, IR26, which was already moving to the place for troop rotation, arrived, the Soviets were pushed back to their starting positions next day. The Soviet counterattack failed to affect already ordered 12.D attack, which severed main railroad connection between Viipuri and Leningrad at August 25. 

At the morning of August 24 Finnish 8.D started crossing Bay of Viipuri with the forces of III/IR45 to Lihaniemi Peninsula which it secured during the same day. At the next day they continued their attack and managed to sever last railroad running from Viipuri during afternoon, and managed to enlage their beachhead few kilometers to every direction during next two days. The 12.D had continued their offensive southwest, and severed Viipuri-Leningrad main road at August 27. At August 28 STAVKA allowed 23.Army to withdraw from Viipuri and form new defensive line to approximately the same place where Mannerheim Line had been. The Soviet forces began immediate retreat and tried forcefully open the roads. At Ylä-Somme they managed to open one road at the evening of August 28, and during the night they managed to move several truck trains through, although under Finnish fire. The artillery fire caused several casualties, and little by little the road become more and more congested and finally only men at foot were able to pass. During the next two days Soviets tried repeatedly open the railroad line along the bay of Viipuri, but at the late evening of August 30 IR3/12.D reached the positions of the 8.D. The [[Battle of Porlampi|motti of Porlampi]] has closed. As the Soviet attempts to open the encirclement during the next day failed and as Finnish encirclement tightened, they made the final attempt to save men by abandoning all vehicles and trying to escape by feet through forests. The ring was already too tight and only small groups managed to escape at this last night. Next morning demoralized troops started to surrender. 9,000 men surrendered and 7,000 were buried there, but almost 12,000 men had managed to escape before the ring closed. Also the booty was abundant: 306 artillery pieces, 55 tanks, 673 trucks, almost 300 tracktors and around 4,500 horses.      

Also at along the main road and railroad between Viipuri and Leningrad the Soviet order to retreat and form a new defensive line along the old Mannerheim Line came too late, as the 12.D at the same day captured Leipäsuo and continued advance southwest, towards Lake Kuolemanjärvi, and southeast, along the railroad. The Soviet defences at main road at Summa held, but Finns encircled these defences by breaching the defences at Munasuo. The defending remains of Soviet 123.D managed to hold Finnish advance only few places and and continued withdrawing towards Leningrad. At the morning of August 30 12.D cut Koivisto-Leningrad railroad at Kuolemanjärvi and reached the Gulf of Finland during the same day. Also at Vammelsuu 12.D cut the railroad at the same evening, but failed to cut main road. The Gulf was reached also here next morning, and the attack continued east to Terijoki, which was captured August 31 and reached old border at River Rajajoki next day. The encircled Soviet forces at Koivisto retreated to the islands and Soviet fleet transferred them to Leningrad. Last defenders of Koivisto were evacuated November 1.

At the left side of 12.D from August 23 the 18.D started attacking southeast between Lake Muolaanjärvi and Vuoksi. By August 26 the first lake isthmuses were breached. Meanwhile first units of 2.D were relieving the forces of the 18.D from isthmus between Lake Kirkkojärvi and Lake Punnusjärvi and 10.D those from Lake Punnusjärvi to River Vuoksi. After the mottis at the northwestern shores of Lake Ladoga had been cleared, I Corps was moved to River Vuoksi where it took 10.D and 15.D to its command. The 18.D breached the second lake isthmuses August 27 and rested one day before continuing attack towards Kivennapa road crossing which it captured August 29. The attack continued towards old border which was reached August 31. Also the 2.D reached the old border at August 31. The 10.D had more troubles as Soviet 198.D had started its counterattack August 29. The Finnish attack started to gain speed during August 30, and also 15.D joined the attack from the other side of the River Vuoksi. Valkjärvi railroad endpoint was captured at August 31 and because of the threat of encirclement, the Soviet forces were ordered to withdraw from the souther side of River Vuoksi behind the old border. 15.D followed retreating Soviets closely and by September 2 old border had been reached everywhere.

At August 20, General W. Erfurth notified Mannerheim, that Field Marshall W. Keitel will send a letter where Finns were asked to attack Leningrad. Mannerheim explained practical difficulties to the proposal and presented the opposition of both political and military leadership to the issue. The government had decided beforehand, that Finland will not attack Leningrad, and only after the pressure of military leadership they accepted small advance across the old border to capture better defensive positions. Especially social democrats opposed crossing the border. When Keitel's letter came, Ryti and Mannerheim prepared negative answer together. At August 31 Erfurth contacted Mannerheim again and proposed that Finns should cancel the attack to East Karelia and instead attack Leningrad. Ryti and Mannerheim provided refusal again. At August 31 Mannerheim gave order, that attack will be stopped at the mouth of River Rajajoki-Ohta-line. The exact line between Ohta and Lake Ladoga would be ordered later, when Finns had reached the old border there. That would shorten the frontline without the need to attack Soviet fortifications north of Leningrad ([[KaUR]]). At this last phase Soviets had six infantry divisions and number of separate batallions and regiments defending Leningrad from the north, but all of them were half strength due to hard fighting with Finns. 

12.D had reached the target already at September 1, but elsewhere attack started at September 2. 18.D captured Mainila at the same day and Valkeasaari at next day. By September 7 both 18.D and 2.D had reached their targets between River Rajajoki and Ohta. The commander of I Corps, Colonel Mäkinen, ordered his troops to advance to the line Ohta-Lake Lempaalanjärvi-Old border at Lake Ladoga with an addition, that if strong defences were met, the offensive could be stopped there. At September 4 the attack begun, and at September 6 10.D managed to encircle and destroy Soviet IR941 at Kirjasalo. Finally at September 9 the ordered line was reached everywhere and Finnish forces moved to defensive.

=== Occupation of East Karelia ===
=== Advancement from Northern Finland ===
=== Political development ===
On [[July 10]], the Finnish army began a major offensive on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and north of [[Lake Ladoga]]. Mannerheim's order of the day, the [[Sword scabbard declaration]], clearly states that the Finnish involvement was an offensive one.[http://www.mannerheim.fi/10_ylip/e_mtuppi.htm] By the end of August 1941, Finnish troops had reached the pre-war boundaries. The crossing of the pre-war borders led to tensions in the army, the cabinet, the parties of the parliament, and domestic opinion. Military expansionism might have gained popularity, but it was far from unanimously championed.

Also, international relations were strained &amp;mdash; notably with Britain and Sweden, whose governments in May and June had learned in confidence from Foreign Minister [[Witting]] that Finland had absolutely no plans for a military campaign coordinated with the Germans. Finland's preparations were said to be purely defensive.

Sweden's leading cabinet members had hoped to improve the relations with Nazi Germany through indirect support of Operation Barbarossa, mainly channelled through Finland. [[Per Albin Hansson|Prime Minister Hansson]] and [[Christian Günther|Foreign Minister Günther]] found however, that the political support in the [[National Unity Government]] and within the Social Democratic organizations turned out to be insufficient, particularly after Mannerheim's Sword Scabbard Declaration, and even more so after Finland within less than two months undeniably had begun a [[war of conquest]]. A tangible effect was that Finland became still more dependent on food and munitions from Germany.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] put Finland under blockade and the British ambassador was withdrawn. On [[July 31]], [[1941]], British [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] made an air raid on the northern Finnish port of [[Petsamo]] [http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/Petsamo_Kirkenes_1941.html]. Damages were limited since the harbour was almost empty of ships. 

[[September 11]], the U.S. ambassador Arthur Schoenfeld was informed that the offensive on the Karelian Isthmus was halted on the pre-Winter War border (with a few straightened curves at the municipalities of Valkeasaari and Kirjasalo), and that &quot;under no conditions&quot; Finland would participate in an offensive against [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], but would instead maintain static defence and wait for a political resolution. Witting stressed to Schoenfeld that Germany, however, should not hear of this.

On [[September 22]], a British note was presented (by Norway's ambassador Michelet) demanding the expulsion of German troops from Finland's territory and Finland's withdrawal from [[East Karelia]] to positions behind the pre-Winter War borders. Finland was threatened by a British declaration of war unless the demands were met. The declaration of war was exacted on Finland's Independence Day, [[December 6]]. 

In December 1941, the Finnish advance had reached [[River Svir]] (which connects the southern ends of [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] and marks the southern border of [[East Karelia]]). By the end of 1941, the front stabilized, and the Finns did not conduct major offensive operations for the following two and a half years. The fighting morale of the troops declined when it was realized that the war would not soon end.

It has been suggested that the execution of the prominent [[pacifism|pacifist]] leader [[Arndt Pekurinen]] in November 1941 was due to fear of army demoralization being exacerbated by such activism.

== International volunteers and support ==
Like in the [[Winter War]], Swedish volunteers were recruited. Until December, for guarding the Soviet naval base at [[Hanko]], that was then evacuated by sea, and the Swedish unit was officially disbanded. During the Continuation War, the volunteers signed for three&amp;ndash;six months of service. In all, over 1,600 fought for Finland, though only about 60 remained by the summer of 1944. About a third of the volunteers had been engaged already in the Winter War. Another significant group, about a fourth of the men, were Swedish officers on leave. 

There was also a ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]''-battalion of volunteers on the northern Finnish front 1942&amp;ndash;1944, that was recruited from [[Norway]], then under German occupation, and similarly some Danes.

About 3,400 Estonian volunteers also took part of the Continuation War.

== Diplomatic manoeuvres ==
Operation Barbarossa was planned as a ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' lasting a few weeks. British and US observers believed that the invasion would be concluded before August. In the autumn of 1941, this turned out to be wrong, and leading Finnish military officers started to mistrust Germany's capacity. German troops in Northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed badly to reach their targets, most importantly [[Murmansk]]. Finland's strategy now changed. A separate peace with the Soviet Union was offered, but Germany's strength was too great. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces at the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps in the hopes that the Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Some may also have still hoped for an eventual victory by Germany.

Finland's participation in the war brought major benefits to Nazi Germany. The Soviet fleet was blockaded in the [[Gulf of Finland]], so that the Baltic was freed for the training of German submarine crews as well as for German shipping, especially for the transport of the vital [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|iron ore from northern Sweden]], and [[Nickel deposits of Finland|nickel and rare metals]] needed in steel processing from the Petsamo area. The Finnish front secured the northern flank of the German [[Army Group North]] in the Baltic states. The sixteen Finnish divisions tied down numerous Soviet troops, put pressure on [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] &amp;mdash; although Mannerheim refused to attack &amp;mdash; and threatened the Murmansk Railroad. Additionally, Sweden was further isolated and was increasingly pressured to comply with German and Finnish wishes, though with limited success.

Despite Finland's contributions to the German cause, the Western Allies had ambivalent feelings, torn between residual goodwill for Finland and the need to accommodate their vital ally, the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain declared war against Finland, but the United States did not. There was no combat between these countries and Finland, but Finnish sailors were interned overseas. In the United States, Finland was highly regarded, partly due to having continued to make payments on its World War I debt faithfully throughout the [[interbellum|inter-war period]].

The Allies often characterize Finland as one of the Axis Powers, although the term used in Finland is &quot;[[co-belligerence]] with Germany&quot;. Finland later also earned respect in the West for the strength of its democracy and its refusal to allow extension of Nazi [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] practices in Finland. Finnish Jews served in the Finnish army, and Jews were not only tolerated in Finland[http://www.finemb.org.il/Historia.htm], but most Jewish refugees were granted asylum (only 8 of the more than 500 refugees were handed over to the Nazis). The field [[synagogue]] in [[Eastern Karelia]] was probably unique on the Axis side during the war. However, in the few cases Jewish officers from Finland's defence forces were awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], they declined. 

About 2,600&amp;ndash;2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans. Most of them (around 2,000) joined the [[Russian Liberation Army]]. The rest were mainly army officers and [[Political officer|political officers]] (and a handful of Jewish refugees), most of them dying in Nazi [[concentration camps]], while some were given to the [[Gestapo]] for interrogation. Sometimes these handovers were demanded in return of arms or food, and sometimes the Finns received Soviet prisoners of war in return. These were mainly Estonians and Karelians willing to join the Finnish army. These, as well as some volunteers from the occupied Eastern Karelia, formed the Kin Battalion (Finnish: ''&quot;Heimopataljoona&quot;''). At the end of the war, the USSR required that the members of the Tribe Battalion were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Some managed to escape before or during the transport, but most of them were either sent to the [[Gulag]] camps or executed.

In 1941, even before the Continuation War, one battalion of Finnish volunteers joined the German [[Waffen-SS]] with silent approval of the Finnish government. It has been concluded that the battalion served as a token of Finnish commitment to cooperation with Nazi Germany. This battalion, named the ''[[Finnisches Freiwilligen Bataillon]]'' fought as part of [[SS Division Wiking|SS Division ''Wiking'']] in the [[Ukraine]] and [[Caucasus]]. The battalion was pulled back from the front in May 1943 and was transported to [[Tallinn]] where it was disbanded on [[July 11]]. The soldiers were then transferred into different units of the Finnish army.

== The end of the war ==
[[Image:Finnish areas ceded in 1944.png|thumb|300px|right|Areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union]]
Finland began to actively seek a way out of the war after the disastrous German defeat at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in January&amp;ndash;February [[1943]]. [[Edwin Linkomies]] formed a new cabinet with the peace process as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943&amp;ndash;44 between Finland and its representative [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]] on the one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached.

Instead, on [[June 9]], [[1944]], the Soviet Union opened a major offensive against Finnish positions on the Karelian Isthmus and in the Lake Ladoga area (it was timed to accompany [[D-Day]]). On the second day of the offensive, the Soviet forces broke through the Finnish lines, and in the succeeding days they made advances that appeared to threaten the survival of Finland. Soviet troops occupied [[Petrozavodsk]] on [[June 28]] [[1944]]. Before they retreated, Finns delivered food to people for two weeks. This is rare or even unequaled act in the war history.

Finland especially lacked modern anti-tank weaponry, which could stop heavy Soviet tanks, and German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] offered them in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not again seek a separate peace. On [[June 26]] President [[Risto Ryti]] gave [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement|this guarantee as a personal undertaking]], which he intended to last for the remainder of his presidency. In addition to material deliveries, Hitler sent some assault gun brigades and a [[Luftwaffe]] fighter-bomber unit to temporarily support the most threatened defence sectors. 

With new supplies from Germany, the Finns were now equal to the crisis, and halted the Russians in early July 1944, after a retreat of about one hundred kilometres that brought them to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of Winter War, the VKT-line (for ''&quot;Viipuri&amp;ndash;Kuparsaari&amp;ndash;Taipale&quot;'' running from Vyborg to [[River Vuoksi]], and along the river to Lake Ladoga at [[Taipale]]), where the Soviet offensive was stopped in the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]], in spite of nearly a third of their military machine being concentrated against the Finns. Finland had already become a sideshow for the Soviet leadership, who now turned their attention to Poland and southeastern Europe. The Allies had already succeeded in their landing in France and were pushing towards Germany, and the Soviet leadership did not want to give them a free hand in Central Europe. Although the Finnish front was once again stabilized, the Finns were exhausted and wanted to get out of the war.

Mannerheim had repeatedly reminded the Germans that in case their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland would be forced to make peace even at very unfavourable terms. Soviet-occupied Estonia would have provided the enemy a favourable base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other cities, and would have strangled Finnish access to the sea. When the Germans indeed withdrew, the Finnish desire to end the war increased. Perhaps realizing the validity of this point, initial German reaction to Finland's announcement of ambitions for a separate peace was limited to only verbal opposition.

President Ryti resigned, and Finland's military leader and national hero, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], was extraordinarily appointed president by the parliament, accepting responsibility for ending the war.

On [[September 4]] the cease-fire ended military actions on the Finnish side. The Soviet Union ended hostilities exactly 24 hours after the Finns. An [[armistice]] was signed in Moscow on [[September 19]] between the Soviet Union and Finland. Finland had to make many limiting concessions: the Soviet Union regained the borders of 1940, with the addition of the [[Petsamo]] area; the [[Porkkala]] Peninsula (adjacent to Finland's capital [[Helsinki]]) was leased to the USSR as a naval base for fifty years (but returned in [[1956]]), and transit rights were granted; Finland's army was to demobilize in haste, and Finland was required to expel all German troops from its territory.  As the Germans refused to leave Finland voluntarily, the Finns had no choice but to fight their former supporters in the [[Lapland War]].

==Conclusion==
In retrospect the Continuation War can be seen as the result of a series of political miscalculations by the Finnish leadership in which Finland's martial abilities clearly outshone her diplomatic skills. However, many commentators also hold that Finland was a victim of bad luck in addition to any failings on its own part, being forced to make a choice in a situation when any of the available alternatives would result in being attacked by either side. It has been claimed that not joining the war with Germany against Soviet Union would almost certainly have lead to occupation attempts by either side of that great conflict, and thus Finland's involvement anyway.

It is also claimed that after the fall of the Soviet Union, it has become clear that Finland, maybe more by luck than by skill, happened to make the right choice after the Winter War by fervently seeking to reverse the German disinterest. This claim rests on the idea that Soviet occupation, and a fate surely worse than that of the other [[Border States]], would otherwise have been unavoidable.

The aged Field Marshal Mannerheim might have been responsible for a couple of misjudgements, for instance the [[Sword scabbard declaration]] in the Order of the Day of July 10, 1941, but at the end of the war he had earned a remarkable reputation among former foes and allies, in Finland as well as abroad, which to a considerable degree eased Finland's extrication from a potentially disastrous undertaking.

In any event, Finland's fate was no worse than any other country struck by the World War &amp;mdash; quite the contrary. Only 2,000 Finnish civilians were killed during World War II, and only relatively narrow border regions had been conquered by force. For nearly three years until [[June 20]], [[1944]], when Vyborg fell, not one major Finnish town was besieged or occupied. During the war there were three capital cities of belligerent European countries that were not occupied by force at some stage: [[London]], [[Moscow]] and [[Helsinki]]. Ultimately, Finland was successful in retaining independence, [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[market economy]].

After the war, Finland preserved her independence while adjusting [[Foreign relations of Finland|her foreign policy]] to avoid offence to the USSR, now the world's second [[superpower]], a concession which the Soviet government reciprocated by surrendering part of its gains from the postwar settlement and refraining from too obvious intrusions in Finland's domestic affairs. Finland also signed a pact of co-operation and mutual assistance that guaranteed that in the event of a war between the western powers and the Soviet Union, Finland would defend her territory and airspace against the western powers. To [[Moscow]], an independent Finland linked to her by a cooperation treaty was seemingly a price worth paying for keeping Sweden formally neutral in the [[Cold War]], a ''quid pro quo'' that for forty years safeguarded wider Soviet strategic interests in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several related results in [[number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]] are known under the name '''''Chinese remainder theorem'''''.

== Simultaneous congruences of integers ==

The original form of the theorem, contained in a [[third-century]] book by [[China|Chinese]] mathematician [[Sun Tzu (mathematician)|Sun Tzu]] and later republished in a [[1247]] book by [[Qin Jiushao]], is a statement about simultaneous congruences (see [[modular arithmetic]]). Suppose ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[integer|integers]] which are pairwise [[coprime]] (meaning [[greatest common divisor|gcd]]
(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 whenever ''i'' &amp;ne; ''j''). Then, for any given integers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists an integer ''x'' solving the system of simultaneous congruences

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{n_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, all solutions ''x'' to this system are congruent modulo the product ''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

A solution ''x'' can be found as follows. For each ''i'' the integers ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are coprime, and using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] we can find integers ''r'' and ''s'' such that ''r n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''s'' ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. If we set ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s'' ''n''/''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we have

:&lt;math&gt;e_i \equiv 1 \pmod{n_i} \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
e_i \equiv 0 \pmod{n_j}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''j'' &amp;ne; ''i''.

One solution to the system of simultaneous congruences is therefore

:&lt;math&gt; x = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i.\ &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the problem of finding an integer ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 3 \pmod{4}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2 \pmod{5}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] for 3 and 4&amp;times;5 = 20, we find (-13) &amp;times; 3 + 2 &amp;times; 20 = 1, i.e. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 40. Using the Euclidean algorithm for 4 and 3&amp;times;5 = 15, we get (-11) &amp;times; 4 + 3 &amp;times; 15 = 1. Hence, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 45. Finally, using the Euclidean algorithm for 5 and 3&amp;times;4 = 12, we get 5 &amp;times; 5 + (-2) &amp;times; 12 = 1, meaning ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -24. A solution ''x'' is therefore 2 &amp;times; 40 + 3 &amp;times; 45 + 2 &amp;times; (-24) = 167. All other solutions are congruent to 167 modulo 60, which means that they are all congruent to 47 modulo 60.

Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;'s are not pairwise coprime. The precise criterion is as follows: a solution ''x'' exists if and only if ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;equiv; ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ('''mod''' gcd(''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'')) for all ''i'' and ''j''. All solutions ''x'' are congruent modulo the [[least common multiple]] of the ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The [[method of successive substitution]] can often yield solutions to simultaneous congruences, even when the moduli are not pairwise coprime.

== Statement for principal ideal domains ==

For a [[principal ideal domain]] ''R'' the Chinese remainder theorem takes the following form: If ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are elements of ''R'' which are pairwise coprime, and ''u'' denotes the product ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the [[quotient ring]] ''R/uR'' and the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R/u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' x ... x ''R/u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;R'' are isomorphic via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/uR \rightarrow R/u_1R \times \cdots \times
R/u_k R &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x +uR) = (x + u_1R, \ldots , x +u_kR) \quad\mbox{ for every } x\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse isomorphism can be constructed as follows. For each ''i'', the elements ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are coprime, and therefore there exist elements ''r'' and ''s'' in ''R'' with

:&lt;math&gt;r u_i + s u/u_i = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

Set ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s u/u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the inverse of ''f'' is the map

:&lt;math&gt;g : R/u_1R \times \cdots \times R/u_kR
\rightarrow R/uR &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(a_1+u_1R,\ldots ,a_k+u_kR)=
\left( \sum_{i=1}^k a_i e_i \right) + uR \quad\mbox{ for all }a_1,\ldots,a_k\in R. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this statement is a straightforward generalization of the above theorem about integer congruences: the ring '''Z''' of [[integer]]s is a principal ideal domain, the [[surjective|surjectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that every system of congruences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_i \pmod{u_i} \quad\mathrm{for}\; i = 1, \ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;
can be solved for ''x'', and the [[injective|injectivity]] of the map ''f'' shows that all the solutions ''x'' are congruent modulo ''u''.

== Statement for general rings ==

The general form of the Chinese remainder theorem, which implies all the statements given above, can be formulated for [[ring (algebra)|rings]] and (two-sided) [[ring ideal|ideals]]. If ''R'' is a ring and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are two-sided ideals of ''R'' which are pairwise [[coprime]] (meaning that ''I&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R'' whenever ''i'' &amp;ne; ''j''), then the product ''I'' of these ideals is equal to their intersection, and the [[quotient ring]] ''R/I'' is isomorphic to the [[product of rings|product ring]] ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x ... x ''R''/''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; via the [[ring homomorphism|isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;f : R/I \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x + I) = (x +I_1, \ldots , x+I_k) \quad\mbox{ for all } x\in R.&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
In the [[RSA|RSA algorithm]] calculations are made modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of two primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Common sizes for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are 1024, 2048 or 4096 [[bit]]s, making calculations very time-consuming. Using Chinese remaindering these calculations can be transported from the ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; to the ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_p \times \Bbb{Z}_q&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the bit sizes of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the bit size of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, making &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; considerably smaller than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. This greatly simplifies calculations.

Another potential application of Chinese remainder theorem is for counting soldiers in an army. Via Chinese remainder theorem, the general has the soldiers quickly line up in groups of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on and counts the remaining soldiers that can't make complete groups.  After enough of these tests are made, the general can quickly calculate how many soldiers he has exactly; thus he has done a 3 hour headcount in all of 2 minutes. This fact, that a large number can be represented by a  small number of relatively small remainders, is also the core idea of [[residue number system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cyril M. Kornbluth''' ([[July 23]], [[1923]] - [[March 21]], [[1958]] -- [[pen-name]]s: '''Cecil Corwin''', '''S.D. Gottesman''', '''Edward J. Bellin''', '''Kenneth Falconer''', '''Walter C. Davies''', '''Simon Eisner,''' '''Jordan Park''') was a [[science fiction]] [[author]] and a notable member of the [[Futurians]]. Kornbluth was born in [[New York City]]. 

Kornbluth served in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]] ([[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]]).  He received a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the [[Battle of the Bulge]].  After his discharge, he returned to finish his education at the [[University of Chicago]], which had been interrupted by the war. 

Kornbluth began writing at fifteen. His first solo work, &quot;King Cole of Pluto,&quot; was published in May 1940 and appeared in [[Science_fiction_magazine|Super Science Stories]] (&quot;Stepsons of Mars,&quot; written with Richard Wilson and published under the name &quot;Ivar Towers&quot; appeared in the April 1940 [[Science_fiction_magazine|Astonishing]]). His other short fiction includes &quot;The Little Black Bag,&quot; &quot;The Marching Morons,&quot; &quot;The Altar at Midnight,&quot; &quot;Ms. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie,&quot; &quot;Gomez,&quot; and &quot;The Advent on Channel 12.&quot;

''The Little Black Bag'' was adapted for television by the [[BBC]] in 1969 for its ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'' series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by [[Rod Serling]] for an episode of his ''[[Night Gallery]]'' series. This dramatization starred [[Burgess Meredith]] as an alcoholic derelict; a discredited former doctor who acquires some far-future medical technology, which he uses benevolently ... thus reclaiming his career and redeeming his soul. 

[[The_Marching_Morons|The Marching Morons]] is Kornbluth's most famous short story; it is a satirical look at an overpopulated future, with a population consisting of a few geniuses and a huge number of stupid people, in which the few geniuses are working desperately to keep things running from behind the scenes. Part of its appeal is that readers tend to identify with the oppressed geniuses. Few people realize that &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot;: it is easy to miss this, as &quot;Bag&quot; is set in the contemporary present while &quot;Morons&quot; takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories.

Many of his novels were written as collaborations: either with [[Judith Merril]] (using the pseudonym &quot;Cyril Judd&quot;), or with [[Frederik Pohl]]. A number of short stories remained unfinished  at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. 

Kornbluth died at the age of thirty four of a heart attack in [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York |Waverly, New York]] although he had lived primarily in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

All of Kornbluth's short stories have been collected as ''His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth'' ([[New England Science Fiction Association|NESFA]] Press, 1997).

Kornbluth was also mentioned in Lemony Snicket's [[Series of Unfortunate Events]] as a member of [[V.F.D.]].

==Personality and habits==
Frederik Pohl (in his autobiography ''[[The Way the Future Was]]'') and [[Damon Knight]] (in his memoir ''[[The Futurians]]'') both give vivid descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and vivid eccentricities. Among the traits which they describe:

* Kornbluth decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories ... in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ancient Roman weapon ''ballista'', Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the &quot;A&quot; volume and had started the &quot;B&quot;.
* According to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.
* Kornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were &quot;supposed to&quot; drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually &quot;weaned himself&quot; (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.

It should be noted that Pohl and Knight both had deep friendships with Kornbluth, and their affection for him is made clear in their respective memoirs. The first of these stories should be treated as apocryphal because there is similar story told by [[Bertrand Russell]] about [[Aldous Huxley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Coprophagia''' is the consumption of [[feces]], from the Greek ''copros'' (feces) and ''phagein'' (eat).  Many [[animal]] species have evolved to practice coprophagia; other
species do not normally consume feces but may do so under unusual conditions.  Only in rare cases is it practiced by humans.

== Evolved coprophagia ==

[[Image:Dscn3200-2-butterflies.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Butterfly|butterflies]] feed on a small lump of [[feces]] lying on a rock.]]

[[Coprophagous insect]]s consume and redigest the feces of large animals; these feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested food.  ([[Herbivore]] digestive systems are especially inefficient.)  Many species exist, the most famous probably being the [[scarab]], sacred in [[ancient Egypt]], and the most ubiquitous being the [[fly]].

[[Pig]]s, like the above insects, will eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semidigested matter.  In certain cultures it was common for poor families to collect [[horse]] feces to feed their pigs.  Pigs are also known to eat their own feces and even human feces as well.  However, domesticated pigs should not be allowed to eat any sort of feces, as this contributes to the risk of [[parasite]] infection. [[Muslims]] cite this behavior as a prime reason why they do not eat [[pork]].

[[Rabbit]]s, [[cavies]] ([[guinea pig]]s) and related species do not have the complicated [[ruminant]] digestive system. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft [[caecal pellet]]s of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not re-eaten.

Young [[elephant]]s eat the feces of their mother to obtain the necessary [[bacteria]] for the proper digestion of the vegetation found on the savannah.  When they are born, their [[intestine]]s do not contain these bacteria.  Without them, these elephants would be unable to get any nutritional value from plants. 

Hamsters eat their own droppings; this is thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s B and K, produced by bacteria in the gut. [[Ape]]s have been observed eating [[horse]] droppings for the [[salt]]. [[Monkeys]] have been observed to eat elephant droppings.

== Theories on Dogs ==

Coprophagia is a behavior sometimes observed, with considerable disgust, by [[dog]] owners.  Hofmeister, Cumming, and Dhein (2001) write that this behavior in animals has not been well-researched, and they are (as of this writing) preparing a study.  In a preliminary online paper, they write that there are various theories explaining why animals consume other animals' feces.  According to various theories&amp;mdash;none proven or disproven&amp;mdash;dogs might do this:
*To get attention from their owners.  
*From anxiety, stress,  or having been punished for bad behaviors.
*From boredom.
*In an attempt to clean up in crowded conditions.
*When dogs observe their owners picking up feces, and imitate this behavior ([[allelomimetic behavior]]). This is highly improbable because the behaviour has also been observed in environments where owners never picked up the dog's (or other) feces. 
*Because puppies taste everything and discover that feces are edible and, perhaps, tasty, especially when fed a high fat content diet.
*Because dogs are, by nature, scavengers, and this is within the range of scavenger behavior.
*To prevent the scent from attracting predators, especially mother dogs eating their offsprings' feces.
*Because the texture and temperature of fresh feces approximates that of regurgitated food, which is how canine mothers in the wild would provide solid food.
*Because of the protein content of the feces (particularly cat feces), or over-feeding, leading to large concentrations of undigested matter in the feces.
*Due to assorted health problems, including:
**Pancreatitis
**Intestinal infections
**Food allergies, creating mal-absorption
*Because they are hungry, such as when eating routines are changed, food is withheld, or nutrients aren't properly absorbed.

Another theory proposes that carnivores sometimes eat the feces of their prey in order to ingest and exude scents which camouflage their own.

Several companies produce food additives that can be added to the troublesome animal's food to make its feces taste excessively bad.

== Humans ==

Coprophagia is extremely uncommon in humans.  It is generally thought to be the result of the [[paraphilia]] known as [[coprophilia]], although it is only diagnosable in extreme cases where it disturbs one's functioning.  Consuming other people's feces carries the risk of contracting diseases spread through fecal matter, such as [[hepatitis]].  Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, pneumonia, and influenza vaccinations are generally recommended for those who engage in this practice[http://www.manscat.com/forum/showthread.php?t=61].  Consuming one's own feces potentially involves risk, as the bowel bacteria and eggs of [[parasitic worm]]s are not safe to ingest. Similar risk can apply to related [[sexual practice]]s, such as [[anilingus]] (often referred to as rimming or a rim job) or inserting an object into the mouth that has recently been in the anus (see [[ass to mouth]]). The practice of coprophagia in humans is depicted in [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s [[1976]] film ''[[Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma]]'', in [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' [[1972]] film ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' starring [[Divine (Glen Milstead)|Divine]] and in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s [[1973]] novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''.

Lewin (2001) reports that &quot;... consumption of fresh, warm camel feces has been recommended by Bedouins as a remedy for bacterial dysentery; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic subtilisin from ''Bacillus subtilis'') was confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Catherine Lucille Moore''' ([[January 24]], [[1911]] &amp;ndash; [[April 4]], [[1987]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[writer]]. She was one of the first women to write in the genre, and paved the way for many other female writers in [[speculative fiction]].

She was born on [[January 24]], [[1911]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. She was chronically ill as a child and spent much of her time reading literature of the fantastic. She left college during [[The Great Depression]] to work as a secretary at the Fletcher Trust Company in Indianapolis. Her first stories appeared in [[pulp magazines]] in the [[1930s]], including two significant series in ''[[Weird Tales]]''. One series concerns the rogue and adventurer, [[Northwest Smith]], and his wanderings through the [[Solar System]]; the other is a short [[fantasy]] series about [[Jirel of Joiry]] (one of the first female protagonists in [[sword-and-sorcery]] fiction). The most famous of the Northwest Smith stories is [[Shambleau]], which marked Moore’s first professional sale. It appeared in the magazine in [[November]], [[1933]], and the sale netted her a hundred dollars. The first and most famous of the Jirel of Joiry stories is [[Black God’s Kiss]], which received the cover illustration (painted by [[Margaret Brundage]]) in the October 1934 ''Weird Tales''. Her early stories were notable for their emphasis on the senses and emotions, which was highly unusual at the time.

Moore met [[Henry Kuttner]], also a science fiction writer, in 1936 when he wrote her a fan letter (mistakeningly thinking that ‘C. L. Moore‘ was a man), and they married in 1940.  Afterwards, almost all of their stories were written in collaboration under various pseudonyms, most commonly “Lewis Padgett.” In this very prolific partnership they managed to combine Moore's style with Kuttner's more cerebral storytelling. Their stories include the now-classic &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogoves&quot; and &quot;Vintage Season.&quot; They also collaborated on a story that combined Moore’s signature characters, Northwest Smith and Jirel of Joiry: [[Quest of the Starstone]] ([[1937]]). After Kuttner's death in [[1958]], Moore wrote almost no fiction. She did write for a few [[television]] shows under her married name, but upon remarrying in [[1963]], she ceased writing entirely.

C. L. Moore died on [[April 4]], [[1987]] at her home in [[Hollywood, California]] after a long battle with [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The '''Compactron''' is a 12-pin [[vacuum tube]] family introduced in [[1961]] by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] with the express purpose of keeping tubes in the market for a few more years during the [[solid state]] revolution.  [[Television]] sets were a primary application.  Most Compactrons are either multiple tubes (e.g. three triodes in one bulb), or high-[[voltage]] and high-power types such as television sweep tubes.

A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the seal-off tip on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with &quot;miniature&quot; tubes. Variations of the Compactron design were made by Sylvania and by some Japanese firms. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early [[1990s]].


Examples:
*6AG11 high-mu twin triode
*6M11 twin triode - pentode
*12AE10 twin pentode
*8B10 twin triode - twin diode
*38HK7 pentode diode
*6AF11
*6GB5 beam power pentode with anode cap

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], a '''Carmichael number''' is a [[composite number|composite]] positive [[integer]] ''n'' which satisfies the [[congruence]] ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''n'')
for all integers ''b'' which are [[relatively prime]] to ''n'' (see [[modular arithmetic]]). They are named for [[Robert Daniel Carmichael|Robert Carmichael]].

==Overview==

[[Fermat's little theorem]] states that all [[prime numbers]] have that property.  In this sense, Carmichael numbers are similar to prime numbers. They are called [[pseudoprime]]s. Carmichael numbers are sometimes also called '''absolute pseudoprimes'''.

Carmichael numbers are important because they can fool the [[Fermat primality test]], thus they are always ''fermat liars''. Since Carmichael numbers exist, this primality test cannot be relied upon to prove the primality of a number, although it can still be used to prove a number is composite.

Still, as numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become very rare. For example, there are 585,355 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately one in 170 billion numbers.) The test is still slightly risky compared to other primality tests such as the [[Solovay-Strassen primality test]].  

An alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by Korselt's theorem from [[1899]].

'''Theorem''' (Korselt 1899): A positive composite integer ''n'' is a Carmichael number if and only if ''n'' is [[square-free integer|square-free]], and for all prime divisors ''p'' of ''n'', it is true that ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 divides ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

It follows from this theorem that all Carmichael numbers are [[odd number|odd]].

Korselt was the first who observed these properties, but he could not find an example. In [[1910]] [[Robert Daniel Carmichael]] found the first and smallest such number, [[561_(number)|561]], and hence the name.  

That 561 is a Carmichael number can be seen with Korselt's theorem. Indeed, 561 = 3 · 11 · 17 is squarefree and 2 | 560, 10 | 560 and 16 | 560. (The notation ''a''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''b'' means: ''a'' [[divisor|divides]] ''b'').

The next few Carmichael numbers are {{OEIS|id=A002997}}:
:1105 = 5 · 13 · 17 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4 | 1104, 12 | 1104, 16 | 1104)
:[[1729 (number)|1729]] = 7 · 13 · 19 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6 | 1728, 12 | 1728, 18 | 1728)
:2465 = 5 · 17 · 29 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4 | 2464, 16 | 2464, 28 | 2464)
:2821 = 7 · 13 · 31 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6 | 2820, 12 | 2820, 30 | 2820)
:6601 = 7 · 23 · 41 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6 | 6600, 22 | 6600, 40 | 6600)
:8911 = 7 · 19 · 67 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6 | 8910, 18 | 8910, 66 | 8910)

J. Chernick proved a theorem in 1939 which can be used to construct a [[subset]] of Carmichael numbers. The number
(6''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)(12''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)(18''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)
is a Carmichael number if its three factors are all prime. 

[[Paul Erd&amp;#337;s]] heuristically argued there should be infinitely many Carmichael numbers. In [[1994]] it was shown by [[William Alford]], [[Andrew Granville]] and [[Carl Pomerance]] that there really exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers.

It has also been shown that for sufficiently large ''n'', there are at least ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/7&lt;/sup&gt; Carmichael numbers between 1 and ''n''.

Löh and Niebuhr in [[1992]] found some of these huge Carmichael numbers including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits.

===Properties===

Carmichael numbers have at least three positive prime factors. The first Carmichael numbers with ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, 4, 5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip; prime factors are (sequence [http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi?Anum=006931 A006931] in [[OEIS]]):

Incidentally, the first Carmichael number (561) is expressible as the sum of two nonnegative first powers in more ways than any smaller number (although admittedly ''all'' nonnegative integers share this property). The second Carmichael number (1105) can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number. The third Carmichael number (1729) is the [[1729 (number)|Hardy-Ramanujan Number]]: the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

== Higher-order Carmichael numbers ==

Carmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of [[abstract algebra]].

The above definition states that a composite integer ''n'' is Carmichael 
precisely when the ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of integers modulo ''n'' to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
As above, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.

The ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also defined on any '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra '''A'''. A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are algebra endomorphisms.

In-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.

===Properties===

Korselt's criterion can be generalized to higher-order Carmichael numbers, see Howe's paper listed below.

A heuristic argument, given in the same paper, appears to suggest that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of order ''m'', for any ''m''. However, not a single Carmichael number of order 3 or above is known.

==Layman's overview==

To see if a number ''n'' is a Carmichael number:
* ''n'' must not be prime (must have factors)
* For every number ''b'' less than ''n'' which has no factors in common with ''n''
** (''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;) mod ''n'' = 1

The following algorithm (in BASIC) performs this test:
 INPUT n
 n1 = n - 1
 fail = 0
 somefactor = 0
 FOR b = 2 TO n1
  IF coprime(b, n) THEN
   bi = 1
   FOR i = 1 TO n1
    bi = bi * b
    bi = bi MOD n
   NEXT i
   IF bi &lt;&gt; 1 THEN
    fail = b
    EXIT FOR
   END IF
  ELSE
   somefactor = 1
  END IF
 NEXT b
 IF fail &gt; 0 THEN
  PRINT n; &quot;fails for b=&quot;; fail
 ELSEIF n &lt;= 1 THEN
  PRINT n; &quot;is 0 or 1&quot;
 ELSEIF somefactor = 0 THEN
  PRINT n; &quot;is a prime&quot;
 ELSE
  PRINT n; &quot;is a Carmichael number&quot;
 END IF

This produces results such as:
 560 fails for b= 3 
 561 is a Carmichael number
 562 fails for b= 3 
 563 is a prime
 564 fails for b= 5

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Controlled Substances Act''' ('''CSA''') was enacted into law by the [[Congress of the United States]] as Title II of the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]] ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode21/usc_sup_01_21_10_13.html 21 U.S.C. Chapter 13]).  The CSA is the legal basis by which the manufacture, importation, possession, and distribution of certain drugs are regulated by the federal government of the [[United States]].  The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

The legislation created five Schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a drug to be included in each.  Two federal departments, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (which includes the [[Food and Drug Administration]]) determine which drugs are added or removed from the various schedules; though the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing.  Classification decisions are required to be made on the criteria of potential for abuse, accepted medical use in the United States, and potential for addiction.

The Department of Justice is also the executive agency in charge of federal law enforcement (i.e. it is the federal police force).  State governments also regulate certain drugs.

==Enforcement authority==
Proceedings to add, delete, or change the schedule of a drug or other substance may be initiated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), or by petition from any interested party, including the manufacturer of a drug, a medical society or association, a pharmacy association, a public interest group concerned with drug abuse, a state or local government agency, or an individual citizen. When a petition is received by the DEA, the agency begins its own investigation of the drug.

The DEA also may begin an investigation of a drug at any time based upon information received from law enforcement laboratories, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies, or other sources of information.

Once the DEA has collected the necessary data, the DEA Administrator, by authority of the Attorney General, requests from the HHS a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation as to whether the drug or other substance should be controlled or removed from control. This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of the HHS. Then, the HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and evaluations and recommendations from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], and on occasion, from the scientific and medical community at large. The Assistant Secretary, by authority of the Secretary, compiles the information and transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific evaluation regarding the drug or other substance, a recommendation as to whether the drug should be controlled, and in what schedule it should be placed.

The medical and scientific evaluations are binding to the DEA with respect to scientific and medical matters. The recommendation on scheduling is binding only to the extent that if HHS recommends that the substance not be controlled, the DEA may not control the substance.

Once the DEA has received the scientific and medical evaluation from HHS, the Administrator will evaluate all available data and make a final decision whether to propose that a drug or other substance be controlled and into which schedule it should be placed.

Under certain circumstances, the Government may temporarily schedule a drug without following the normal procedure. An example is when international treaties require control of a substance. In addition, ''21 U.S.C. § 811(h)'' allows the Attorney General to temporarily place a substance in Schedule I &quot;to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety&quot;. Thirty days' notice is required before the order can be issued, and the scheduling expires after a year; however, the period may be extended six months if rulemaking proceedings to permanently schedule the drug are in progress. In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated.

The CSA also creates a closed system of distribution for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.

==History==
Since its enactment in [[1970]], the Act has been amended several times:
*The [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]] of [[1978]] added provisions implementing the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].
* The [[Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984]].
*The [[Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act]] of [[1988]] added provisions implementing the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].
*The [[Domestic Chemical Diversion and Control Act]] of [[1993]].
*The [[Federal Analog Act]].

==International law==
The Congressional findings in ''21 U.S.C. § 801(7)'', ''21 U.S.C. § 801(a)(2)'', and ''21 U.S.C. § 801(a)(3)'' state that a major purpose of the CSA is to &quot;enable the United States to meet all of its obligations&quot; under international [[treaty|treaties]] - specifically, the [[1961]] [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and the [[1971]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]][http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/agency/csa.htm]. The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several Schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority.
Under ''[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/811.htm 21 U.S.C. § 811]'' of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles.htm#3 Article 3] of the Single Convention and [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1971/articles.htm#2 Article 2] of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.

''21 U.S.C. § 811(d)'' provides for automatic compliance with treaty obligations and establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to &quot;issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,&quot; without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because ''21 USC § 811(d)(2)(B)'' requires the Secretary the power to &quot;evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.&quot;

Similarly, if the UN [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a Schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different Schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.

This provision was invoked in [[1984]] to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In [[1999]], an FDA official explained to Congress[http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html]:
:''Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.''

The [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the U.S. into conflict with [[international law]][http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf].  The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]]. Many articles in these treaties - such as [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles_II.htm?#35 Article 35] and [http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1961/articles_II.htm?#36 Article 36] of the Single Convention - are prefaced with phrases such as &quot;Having due regard to their constitutional, legal and administrative systems, the Parties shall . . .&quot; or &quot;Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall . . .&quot; According to former [[United Nations Drug Control Programme]] Chief of Demand Reduction [[Cindy Fazey]], &quot;This has been used by the USA not to implement part of article 3 of the 1988 Convention, which prevents inciting others to use narcotic or psychotropic drugs, on the basis that this would be in contravention of their constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech&quot;[http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm].

==Constitutional issues==
Most of the Congressional findings and declarations in ''21 U.S.C. § 801'' are devoted to establishing the statute's constitutionality. Using similar language to [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, the CSA cites the impact of intrastate drug offences on &quot;interstate commerce&quot; and the &quot;general welfare&quot; of the American people. However, [[David Boaz]], executive director of the Cato Institute, claims that &quot;The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states or the people all powers not granted to the federal government. At least the advocates of alcohol Prohibition had enough respect for the Constitution to seek a constitutional amendment to impose Prohibition, but Congress never asked the American people for the constitutional power to impose drug prohibition&quot;[http://www.cato.org/dailys/3-03-97.html].

In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled the CSA illegal as it applied to the use of medical marijuana in the case ''[[Raich v. Ashcroft]]'',  [[Case citation|352 F.3d 1222]] ([[9th Cir.]] [[2003]]).  However, the case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] by the federal government, and in [[2005]], the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the federal government.

==Drug Schedules==

'''''The below lists are incomplete.  Consult the [http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html DEA Drug Scheduling Reference] for a longer list.'''''

21 U.S.C. §812(b) specifies the findings that the government must make in order to classify a drug in a certain schedule.  The specific classification of any given drug is usually a source of controversy, as is the purpose and effectiveness of the entire regulatory scheme.

===Schedule I drugs===

Findings required:

:''(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.''
:''(B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.''
:''(C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.''

Under the DEA's interpretation of the CSA, a drug does not necessarily have to have the same abuse potential as heroin or cocaine to merit placement in Schedule I (in fact, cocaine is currently a Schedule II drug) [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-9306-filed]:
:''When it comes to a drug that is currently listed in schedule I, if it is undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and it is further undisputed that the drug has at least some potential for abuse sufficient to warrant control under the CSA, the drug must remain in schedule I. In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of &quot;a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.&quot; 21 USC 812(b).''

Sentences for first-time, non-violent offenders convicted of trafficking in Schedule I drugs can easily turn into ''de facto'' life sentences when multiple sales are prosecuted in one proceeding.  See ''United States v. Angelos'', [[Case citation|345 F. Supp. 2d 1227]] ([[D. Utah]] [[2004]]) (55 years for three sales of marijuana).  Sentences for violent offenders are much higher.

Drugs on this schedule include:

* [[GHB]] (Gamma-hydroxybutyrate), which has been used as a general anaesthetic with minimal side-effects and controlled action but a limited safe dosage range. It was placed in Schedule I in [[March 2000]] after widespread recreational use;

* [[Ibogaine]], which has potential medical uses in the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction and is regarded as an experimental, rather than illegal, drug in some countries;

* [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] (Marijuana). Cannabis was placed into Schedule I by Congress in [[1970]] pursuant to the recommendation of Assistant Secretary of Health [[Roger O. Egeberg]]. [[Jon Gettman]] and other activists have argued that strict application of the &quot;no currently accepted medical use&quot; requirement would exclude from this schedule and place it in Schedule II, since it does have recognised medical uses in the U.S., notably to control nausea in those undergoing [[chemotherapy]]; see [[medical marijuana]]. In [[1988]], the DEA's own administrative law judge, [[Francis Young]], proposed moving marijuana into Schedule II, on the basis that marijuana is &quot;one of the safest therapeutically active drugs known to man&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[[#References|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; and that a respectable minority of physicians supported its medical uses. The DEA refused to honor Young's ruling, and subsequent petitions to reschedule have been denied. In a January 17, [[2001]] letter to DEA Administrator [[Robert Bonner]] entitled ''Basis for the Recommendation for Maintaining Marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act'', [[David Satcher]], Assistant Secretary for Health and [[Surgeon General of the United States]] stated, &quot;marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Accordingly, HHS recommends that marijuana * * * continue to be subject to control under Schedule I of the CSA.&quot; See [[cannabis rescheduling in the United States]];

* [[Heroin]] (Diacetylmorphine), which is used in much of Europe as a potent pain reliever in terminal cancer patients. (It is about twice as strong, by weight, as morphine.) Some argue that the taboo surrounding heroin is what is keeping it in the Schedule I category;

* [[Ecstasy_(drug)|Ecstasy]] (MDMA), which continues to be used medically, notably in the treatment of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved this PTSD use in [[2001]]. Medical recommendations were that because of its medical use it be placed in Schedule III, not Schedule I;

* [[Psilocybin]], a drug which was studied in an FDA-approved study for its potential use in the treatment of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]];

* [[5-MeO-DIPT]];

* MDA ([[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]]);

* [[LSD]];

* [[Mescaline]];

* [[Peyote]];

* [[Quaalude]];

* DOM [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine]]

===Schedule II drugs===

Findings required:
:''(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.''
:''(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.''
:''(C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.''

These drugs are only available by [[medical prescription|prescription]], and distribution is carefully controlled and monitored by the DEA.

Drugs on this schedule include:

* [[Cocaine]] (used as a topical anaesthetic);

* [[Methylphenidate]] (Ritalin);

* Most pure opioid agonists: [[Pethidine|Pethidine (INN) or meperidine (USAN)]], [[fentanyl]], [[opium]], [[oxycodone]], or [[morphine]];

* Short-acting [[barbiturates]], such as secobarbital;

* [[Amphetamines]], except for injectable [[methamphetamine]]. Amphetamines were originally placed in Schedule III, but were moved to Schedule II in [[1971]]. Injectable methamphetamine has always been in Schedule II;

===Schedule III drugs===

Findings required:
:''(A) The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.''
:''(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.''
:''(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.''

These drugs are available only by prescription, though control of wholesale distribution is somewhat less stringent than Schedule II drugs.

Drugs on this schedule include:

* [[Anabolic steroid]]s;

* Intermediate-acting [[barbiturates]], such as talbutal;

* [[Ketamine]], a drug that was originally developed as a milder substitute for PCP (primarily to be used as a human anesthetic) but has since become popular as a veterinary anesthetic;

* [[Paregoric]];

* Xyrem, a preparation of [[GHB]] used to treat [[narcolepsy]]. Xyrem is in Schedule III but with a restricted distribution system;

* [[Marinol]], a synthetic [[cannabinoid]] used to treat [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] caused by [[chemotherapy]], as well as [[Appetite|appetite loss]] caused by [[AIDS]];

* [[Hydrocodone]] / [[Codeine]], when compounded with an [[NSAID]](e.g. Vicoprofen, when compounded with [[Ibuprofen]]) or with Acetaminophen (e.g. Vicodin / Tylenol 3);

* Rohypnol ([[Flunitrazepam]]). Flunitrazepam was placed in Schedule IV in [[1984]] and moved to Schedule III in [[1995]], but the DEA is considering moving it into Schedule I because of widespread non-medical use, and the fact that flunitrazepam is not approved by the FDA. It is best known as a [[rape#Acquaintance (&quot;date&quot;) rape|date rape]] drug but is also fairly widely used in recreational ways. Flunitrazepam is already classified as a Schedule I drug in several states.

===Schedule IV drugs===

Findings required:
:''(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.''
:''(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.''
:''(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.''

Control measures are similar to Schedule III.

Drugs on this schedule include:

* [[Benzodiazepines]], such as [[alprazolam]] (Xanax), [[chlordiazepoxide]] (librium), and [[diazepam]] (Valium);

* Long-acting [[barbiturates]] such as phenobarbital;

* Some partial [[agonist]] opioid analgesics, such as [[propoxyphene]] (Darvon) and [[pentazocine]] (Talwin);

* Certain non-amphetamine stimulants, including [[pemoline]] and [[Modafinil]].

===Schedule V drugs===

Findings required:
:''(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.''
:''(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.''
:''(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.''

Schedule V drugs are sometimes available without a prescription.

Drugs on this schedule include:

*Cough suppressants containing small amounts of [[codeine]];

*Preparations containing small amounts of [[opium]] or [[Diphenoxylate]] (used to treat diarrhea);

*[[Pregabalin]], an anticonvulsant and pain modulator.

===Other provisions===
The federal law has only five schedules, but some states have added a &quot;[[Schedule VI]]&quot; to cover certain substances which are not &quot;drugs&quot; in the conventional sense, but are nonetheless abused recreationally; these include [[toluene]] (found in many types of paint, especially spray paint) and similar [[inhalants]] such as [[amyl nitrite]] (or [[poppers]]), [[butyl nitrite]], and [[nitrous oxide]] (found in many types of aerosol cans).  Many state and local governments enforce age limits on the sale of products containing these substances.

Due to [[pseudoephedrine]] being widely used in the manufacture of [[methamphetamine]], the state of [[Oregon]] now requires a prescription for pharmacies to dispense any cold remedy containing pseudoephedrine. Likewise, the state of [[Iowa]] restricts sales of pseudoephedrine-containing products to licensed pharmacies and requires customers to show photo ID and sign a log book. This affects many preparations which were previously available over-the-counter, such as ''Sudafed'' and equivalent products.

Pharmaceuticals that require a prescription to be dispensed often are not covered under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. This category includes medicines which should only be taken under a doctor's care, or which may have harmful interactions with other substances, but which are not known to be addictive and which are not used recreationally. These medications are used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions and to manage chronic conditions. 

Drugs requiring prescriptions are sometimes also known as '''legend drugs''' because legislation requires labels with the legend, &quot;Caution! Federal law prohibits dispensing without a prescription.&quot;

The term '''controlled drugs''' is sometimes used for scheduled drugs because of the additional controls placed on them (beyond the need for a prescription).

'''Claude Piron''' (born [[1931]]), a [[linguistics|linguist]] and a [[psychology|psychologist]], was a translator for the [[United Nations]] (from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] into [[French language|French]]) from [[1956]] to [[1961]].  After leaving the UN he worked for the [[World Health Organization]] all over the world, as well as being a prolific author of [[Esperanto]] works.  He has used Esperanto in many countries, including [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], a few places in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], and almost all [[Europe|European]] countries.

He is a psychotherapist and taught in the psychology department of [[Geneva]] University ([[Switzerland]]) from [[1973]] to [[1994]]. His French language book ''Le defi des langues - Du gachis au bon sens'' (''The language challenge - From chaos to common sense'') ([[Paris]]: L'[[Harmattan]], [[1994]]) is a kind of [[psychoanalysis]] of international communication. A [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] version, ''O desafio das linguas'', was published in 2002 ([[Campinas, Sao Paulo]]: Pontes, [[2002]]).

In a [http://www.claude-piron.ch/hidden-perverse-effects.html lecture on the current system of international communication] Piron argued that &quot;Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes.&quot; and &quot;...differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns...The same neuropsychological law...- called by...[[Jean Piaget]] ''generalizing assimilation'' - applies to word formation as well as to grammar.&quot;

His diverse Esperanto writings include instructional books, books for beginners, novels, short stories, poems, articles and non-fiction books.  His most famous works are ''[[Gerda Malaperis]]'' and ''[[La Bona Lingvo]]'' (The Good Language).  ''Gerda Malaperis'' is a novella which uses basic grammar and vocabulary in the first chapter and builds up to expert Esperanto by the end, including word lists so beginners can easily follow along.  In ''La Bona Lingvo'', Piron captures the basic linguistic and social aspects of Esperanto.  He argues strongly for imaginative use of the basic Esperanto morpheme inventory and word formation techniques, and against unnecessary importation of neologisms from European languages.  He also presents the idea that once one has learned enough vocabulary to express oneself, it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many other languages.

'''Captain America''', the alter ego of '''Steve Rogers''' (in some accounts Steven Grant Rogers), is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in [[Timely Comics]]' ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941).

==Publication history==
Captain America was one of the most popular characters that Marvel Comics (then known as [[Timely Comics|Timely]]) had during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  He was, if not the [[The Shield (Archie)|first]], certainly the most prominent and enduring of a wave of patriotically themed superheroes that American [[comic book]] companies introduced just prior to and during [[World War II]]. With his sidekick [[Bucky]], Captain America faced [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] troops during his 1940s heyday, but after the end of the war, his main reason for existence (as a fictional war hero) was gone, and the character's popularity faded.  Bucky disappeared from the comic in 1948 and was replaced by Captain America's girlfriend, Betty Ross, or [[Golden Girl]].  By the end of 1949, after the publication of ''Captain America's Weird Tales'' #74, Captain America had disappeared from comic book pages.

He was briefly revived, along with the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]], by Marvel's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], in ''Young Men'' #24 (December 1953) as an anti-[[Communist]] superhero.  Captain America made several appearances over the next year in ''Young Men'' and ''Men's Adventures'', as well as in three issues of his eponymous title, but sales were poor.  After the publication of ''Captain America'' #78 (September 1954), the character disappeared again.  In the 1970s, this version of Captain America would be [[retcon]]ned into a separate character&amp;mdash;not Steve Rogers&amp;mdash;who briefly took up the mantle.

In 1964, by which point Atlas had evolved into [[Marvel Comics]], Captain America was revived with the explanation that he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] in the final days of the war and spent the past decades frozen in a state of [[suspended animation]]. (Retellings sometimes place the event over the [[English Channel]].) The hero found a new generation of readers as the leader of the all-star group the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and in a new solo series.

Since then, Captain America has been a much more serious and less jingoistic hero. Writers have used the character to reflect the conflict between politics and ideology by placing him at odds with the United States government and angry and troubled about the state of the country. He considers himself dedicated to defending America’s ideals rather than its political leadership, a conviction summed up when Captain America confronted an [[United States Army|army]] general who tried to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty. Rogers responded, &quot;I'm loyal to nothing, General.. except the [[American Dream|Dream]].&quot; (''[[Daredevil]]'' #233, August 1986)

Marvel has repeatedly revised the Captain America continuity; the character's unbreakable ties to a specific time period make it particularly difficult for the series to avoid conspicuous anomalies and inconsistencies.

==Character biography==
====1940s - Operation: Rebirth====
[[Image:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
In current [[Marvel Universe]] history, Steven Rogers was a scrawny [[United States|American]] [[fine arts]] student specializing in illustration in the early 1940s before America's entry into [[World War II]].  He was disturbed by the rise of the [[Third Reich]] enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution.  By chance, a US Army officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country.  This project, Operation: Rebirth, consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal.

Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject.  He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super-Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr. Emil Erskine (who was code-named &quot;Dr. Reinstein&quot;).  Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of &quot;Vita-Rays&quot; that activated and stabilized the chemicals in his system.  Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiology from its relatively frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes.

[[Image:Captainamerica5.jpg|thumb|200px|''Captain America'' Vol. 5, #5, together with fellow [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]]. Art by [[Steve Epting]].]]
At this moment, a Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] revealed himself and shot Erskine.  Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super-Soldier formula to memory, it could not be duplicated.  Rogers killed the spy in retaliation (retconned in the 1960s so that the spy accidentally killed himself by fleeing headlong into an &quot;electrical omniverter&quot;) and vowed to oppose the enemies of America.  The [[United States]] government, making the most of its one super-soldier, reimagined him as a superhero who served both as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent and a [[propaganda]] symbol to counter Nazi [[Germany]]'s head of terrorist operations, the [[Red Skull]].  To that end, Rogers was given a costume modeled after the [[American flag]], a [[Captain America's shield|bulletproof shield]], a personal [[sidearm]] and the codename Captain America. He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp LeHigh in Virginia. Barely out of his teens himself, Rogers then made friends with the teenage camp [[mascot]], [[Bucky|James Buchanan &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes]].

Barnes accidentally learned of Roger's [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offered to keep the secret if he could become Captain America's [[sidekick]].  Rogers agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately.  By this time Rogers had met President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who presented him with a new shield made from a chance mixture of [[iron]], [[vibranium]] and an unknown catalyst.  The alloy was indestructible, yet the shield was light enough to use as a [[discus]]-like weapon that could be angled to return to him. (In several stories, due to writer error, the shield was described as an [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]-vibranium alloy.) It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped.  Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fought the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team [[Invaders (comics)|the Invaders]] (beginning with 1970s comics), which after the war evolved into the [[All-Winners Squad]] (in 1940s comics).

Rogers was not the first to be given the Super Soldier formula.  It was revealed years later that while Rogers was still being assessed, some military members of the project felt that a non-soldier was not the right candidate and secretly gave Erskine's incomplete formula to Clinton McIntyre.  However, this made McIntyre violently insane, and he had to be subdued and placed in cold storage.  The criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] would later revive McIntyre as the homicidal [[Protocide]]. (''Captain America Annual'', 2000). 

A beta version of the formula was given to [[Isaiah Bradley]], who became the only survivor of a group of [[African-American]] soldiers that &quot;Reinstein&quot; and the military experimented on in 1942.  After the last two members of his group were killed, Bradley stole the costume meant for Rogers and wore it on a suicide mission to destroy the Nazi super-soldier effort at a German concentration camp.  Bradley was captured, but eventually rescued and [[court martial]]ed.  He was imprisoned for 17 years in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Leavenworth]] until he was pardoned by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].  By the time of his release, the long-term effects of the formula turned Bradley into a hulking, sterile giant with the mentality of a 7-year-old.  Rogers would not find out about Bradley until decades later (''Truth: Red, White and Black'', 2003).  The [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], a member of the [[Young Avengers]], has been revealed to be the grandson of Isaiah Bradley.

According to files in the Weapons Plus Program, a clandestine government organization devoted to the creation of superhumans to combat and eventually exterminate mutants, Rogers was &quot;Weapon I&quot;, the first generation living weapon.  Following his disappearance, the following installments of the Weapon Plus Program moved on to new attempts to create the ultimate weapon, experimenting on animals, racial minorities, criminals and eventually mutants, with results such as [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Deadpool]] and [[Fantomex]] (''New X-Men'' #145, October 2003).

In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky tried to stop the villainous [[Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane.  Zemo launched the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit.  They reached the plane just before it took off, but when Bucky tried to defuse the bomb, it exploded in mid-air.  The young man was believed killed, and Rogers was hurled into the freezing waters of either the North Atlantic or the English Channel (accounts differ). Neither his body or Bucky's were found, and both were presumed dead.

====Late 1940s&amp;ndash;1950s - After Steve Rogers====
Fearing a blow to morale if the news of Captain America's demise was revealed, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] asked William Naslund, the Golden Age patriotic costumed hero known as the Spirit of '76, to assume the role, with a young man named Fred Davis as Bucky.  They continued to serve in the same roles after the war with the [[All-Winners Squad]], until Naslund was fatally injured in a battle with the [[android]] Adam II in 1946 (''What If?'' #4, August 1977). With Naslund's death, Jeff Mace, also known as the Golden Age [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], took over as Captain America, with Davis continuing to act as Bucky.  However, Davis was shot and injured in 1948 and forced to retire.  Mace then teamed up with Betsy &quot;Golden Girl&quot; Ross, and sometime before 1953 gave up his Captain America identity to marry her. Mace contracted [[cancer]] and died some decades later (''Captain America'' #285, September 1983).

In 1953, an unnamed man who idolized Captain America and had done his American History Ph.D. thesis on Rogers discovered some Nazi files in a warehouse in Germany, one of which apparently contained the lost formula for the Super Soldier serum.  He took it to the United States government on the condition that they use it to make him the fourth Captain America.  Needing a symbol for the [[Korean War]], they agreed, and the man underwent plastic surgery to look like Steve Rogers, even assuming that name.  However, the war ended and the project never went forward.  &quot;Rogers&quot; found a teaching job at the Lee School, where he met Jack Monroe, a young orphan who also idolized Captain America.  They decided to use the formula on themselves and became the new Captain America and Bucky, this time fighting the so-called [[Communism|Communist]] scourge (''Young Men'' #24&amp;ndash;28, Dec. 1953&amp;ndash;May 1954). These stories were written by [[Stan Lee]] with art by a young [[John Romita Sr.]]

&quot;Rogers&quot; and Monroe did not know of and therefore did not undergo the &quot;Vita-Ray&quot; process, however.  The imperfect implementation of the formula in their systems made them [[paranoia|paranoid]], and by the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist.  In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] placed them in suspended animation.  The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, go on another rampage, and be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after (''Captain America'' #153, Sept. 1972).

====1960s&amp;ndash;1970s - The return of Steve Rogers====
[[Image:Avengers4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #4 (March 1964), art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
In ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964), the Avengers discovered Steve Rogers's body in the North Atlantic, his costume under his soldier's uniform and still carrying his shield.  Rogers had been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, which melted after the block was thrown back into the ocean by the Sub-Mariner, enraged that an Arctic tribe was worshipping the frozen figure.  When Rogers revived, he related his last, failed mission in the closing days of the war.  Rogers accepted membership in the Avengers, and although he soon adjusted to modern times well enough to eventually assume leadership of the team, he was plagued by guilt for not being able to prevent Bucky's death.  He also undertook missions for the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which was commanded by his old war comrade [[Nick Fury]].

Captain America was once again given his own series (now in its fifth incarnation), which has lasted decades longer than its original run.  The book initially enjoyed the artwork of Jack Kirby as well as a short run by [[Jim Steranko]], and many of the industry's top artists and writers have worked on the book. It was in a storyline during the book's initial series that Rogers met and trained an [[African American]], Sam Wilson, who became the superhero known as the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. The Falcon was one of the few black superheroes in comic books at that time, and it began a long association between the two characters that has continued to the present day.

[[Image:CaptainAmericaV1-180.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover to ''Captain America'' #180 (Dec. 1974). Captain America assumes the &quot;Nomad&quot; identity. Art by [[Gil Kane]].]]
The most notable stories often had a political tone to them. For example, during [[Steve Englehart]]'s stint as writer, Rogers encountered his revived 1950s counterpart and dealt with the Marvel Universe's version of the [[Watergate scandal]].  This last story so severely disillusioned Rogers that he abandoned his Captain America identity in favour of one called [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] only to reassume it to face the menace of the [[Red Skull]], this time as a symbol of America's ideals rather than its government.
During this time, several men tried to assume the Captain America identity, all without success.  Jack Monroe, cured of his mental instability, would, years later, take up the Nomad alias. (''Captain America'' #176&amp;ndash;#183, 1974&amp;ndash;1975). For a time before and during this period, Rogers also gained (temporarily as it turned out) super strength.

====1980s====
In the 1980s, in a story written by [[Mark Gruenwald]], Rogers chose to resign his identity rather than submit to the orders of the United States government and took the alias of &quot;The Captain&quot; instead.  This extended story arc was intended to illustrate the difference of Captain America's beliefs from his replacement who was intended to illustrate the jingoistic attitude that the popular movie character [[Rambo]] embodied and which Rogers did not share.  During this period, the role of Captain America was assumed by John Walker, the former Super-Patriot.  When Rogers returned to his Captain America identity, Walker became the [[John Walker (comics)|USAgent]] (''Captain America'' #332&amp;ndash;#351, 1987&amp;ndash;1989).

====1990s====
Some time after returning to the position of Captain America, Rogers narrowly avoided the explosion of a [[methamphetamine]] lab, but it triggered a chemical reaction between the drug and the Super-Soldier serum in his system. To combat this reaction, the serum was removed from his system, and now Rogers had to train constantly to maintain his physical condition. The storyline was partly prompted by reader concerns that Captain America was effectively the beneficiary of [[steroid]] treatments. A [[retcon]] was then introduced to establish that the serum was not a drug, because if it were, Rogers' body would have metabolized it out of his system some time ago. It was revealed that the &quot;serum&quot; was in fact a virus that had affected a biochemical and genetic change, explaining how the Red Skull (who now inhabited a body [[cloning|cloned]] from Rogers' cells) also had the formula in his body.

However, because of his altered biochemistry which took the form of the &quot;serum&quot; in his blood work, Rogers's body began to deteriorate due to overuse of the &quot;serum&quot;. For a time, he had to wear a powered [[exoskeleton]] to keep moving and eventually had to be placed again in suspended animation.  During this time, he was given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull, which cured his condition and stabilized the Super-Soldier serum/virus in his system.  Captain America returned both to crime fighting and the Avengers (''Captain America'' #425&amp;ndash; 454, 1994&amp;ndash;1996).

====2000s====
Eventually, Rogers went public with his identity again, and established a residence in the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He discovered that Bucky was brought back to life and used by Russians, as the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]].

==Powers and abilities==
Rogers in the regular Marvel Universe has no superhuman powers. However, as a result of the Super-Soldier serum, he was transformed from a frail young man into a &quot;nearly perfect&quot; specimen of human development and conditioning, making him able to lift (press) 800 lbs over his head with extreme effort. He has also been depicted curling 500 lbs numerous times in a workout routine. Captain America is as strong, fast, agile, and durable as it is possible for a human being to be without being considered superhuman. The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and also prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being.

Mentally, his battle experience and training has also made him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle.  Rogers's reflexes and senses are also extraordinarily keen.  He has mastered [[boxing]], [[jiu jitsu]] and [[judo]], combined with his virtually superhuman gymnastic ability into his own unique fighting style. Years of practice with using his indestructible shield has made it practically an extension of his own body, and he is able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy and [[ricochet]] the shield to hit multiple targets; all told, he is one of the finest hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe.

===Weapons and equipment===
Captain America has used [[Captain America's shield|many shields]] over the years, the most traditional of which is an indestructible [[discus]]-shaped shield made from a vibranium/steel alloy. This alloy was accidentally created and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse engineer it resulted in the creation of [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]].

His costume is made of a fire-retardant material.  He also wears a light weight &quot;duralumin&quot; [[chainmail]] beneath his costume for added protection. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has his Avengers priority card, which also serves as a communications device, on his person at all times.

==Alternate Captain Americas==
===Ultimate Captain America===
The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Captain America has superpowers, is more reactionary than his counterpart and is more prone to violent solutions as well as morally old-fashioned. 

In this version, Steve Rogers was a frail volunteer who underwent months of steroid treatment, surgery, and the Super-Soldier formula to become Captain America. Bucky was a childhood friend who followed him on his missions as a photographer and not a costumed sidekick. Rogers' last mission as Captain America sent him deep into [[Nazi Germany]] to stop a prototype hydrogen bomb created with alien technology. He caused the rocket carrying the bomb to explode, but fell into the freezing cold Arctic Ocean; rather than die from [[hypothermia]], Rogers fell into [[suspended animation]] until a fishing trawler pulled him out of the water 57 years later. Bucky survived the war, and, thinking that Rogers had been killed in action, married Rogers' fiancée, Gail. 

Rogers became one of the first members of the [[Ultimates]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s answer to battle [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|posthuman]] [[terrorism]]. He began adjusting to life in the 21st century, although he still longed for older times and values, spending much time with Bucky and Gail (now senior citizens) as well as going to WWII veterans' reunions. Recently, events made it appear that Captain America was the one who had repeatedly betrayed the team over the course of the past year. The real traitor has since been revealed to be [[Ultimate Black Widow|the Black Widow]].

Rogers is at least as skilled in combat as his [[Earth-616]] counterpart. In addition, his strength is superhuman rather than just at peak human levels. In the Ultimate Universe, Bruce Banner became the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]] as a result of his experiments to recreate the Super-Soldier serum. Despite the Hulk being one of the strongest characters in the Ultimate Universe, Rogers was able to defeat Banner in hand-to-hand combat, bringing the Hulk down and out of the fight for a moment.  In addition, Rogers was also able to defeat [[Henry Pym]] in melee combat while Pym was in his Giant Man form, a size almost 60 feet high.

===Others===

*In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' comic books, the funny animal version of Captain America is Steve Mouser, an anthropomorphic cat that works for the Daily Beagle, who is also secretly Captain Americat. 
*In a recent ''[[House of M]]'' crossover issue, another alternate Steve Rogers was featured, one who lived through World War II and was not frozen. 
*In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, Captain America joined [[Havok| Havok's]] team of superheroes called '''The Six''' in order to protect mutants from a deranged [[Nick Fury]] and [[SHIELD]]. He was '''not''' Steve Rogers, but his successor and, in fact, was a mutant. This version was killed after a re-awakend [[Beyonder]] attempted to infuse his body with enormous amounts of energy.
*Most infamous perhaps, was [[Rob Liefeld]]'s disastrous take on the character as part of the [[Heroes Reborn]] event.
*Other alternate Captain Americas include several seen in issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', a comic featuring tales of alternate realities.

==Appearances in other media==
===Movies===
[[Image:Captainamerica2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Matt Salinger]] playing Captain America in the 1991 movie]]
A 1944 movie [[serial]] called ''Captain America'' portrayed the hero as a district attorney named Grant Gardner and arbitrarily removed many other important elements of the character, such as his shield and his sidekick, Bucky. The 1966 syndicated [[animated TV series]] ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' included &quot;Captain America&quot; segments. The primitive animation was largely composed of stills photostatted from Jack Kirby art. 

A direct-to-video movie, ''Captain America'' (1991), starring [[Matt Salinger]], earned highly negative reviews. It depicted the hero's battle against the [[Red Skull]], who in the film was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fascism|fascist]] rather than a German [[Nazi]]. Rumours of a new Captain America movie have circulated since 2005, but have thus far not produced anything concrete. 

In 2005 [[Variety]] reported that Marvel Comics had announced the formation of Marvel Entertainment, a business entity dedicated to film adaptations of Marvel Comics properties.  Coinciding with the announcement was a list of Marvel properties being developed for production by the company's new film arm to be released through partnership with [[Paramount Pictures]]; that list included Captain America.  Other properties specifically named in the press announcement are: [[the Avengers]], [[Nick Fury]], [[Black Panther]], [[Ant-Man]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], [[Dr. Strange]], [[Hawkeye]], Power Pack, and Shang-Chi.  Budgets for each film are expected to be between $45 million and $180 million.  The first picture under the arrangement is slated for release by 2008.

According to a news report circulated by the [[Associated Press]] and other major wire services, actor [[Rikki Lee Travolta]] turned down a contract to take over for [[Pierce Brosnan]] in the role of [[James Bond]] because he was expected to sign to play Captain America in a new film adaptation.[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/travolta%20i%20turned%20down%20bond] Subsequent news reports repeat the story that Travolta is in negotiations to play Captain America. However, neither Travolta nor Marvel has yet released any statement on the matter.[http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20051031103412243]

===Television===
[[Image:Captainamerica1.gif|180px|right|thumb|Reb Brown as Captain America (1979, TV)]]
Captain America was featured in the 1970s in two live-action television movies, ''Captain America'' and ''Captain America II: Death Too Soon'' starring Reb Brown. The character was slightly different than the comics, both in his origin and his operations. Besides his shield, this Captain America also made significant use of a specialized van and motorcycle which was memorable for its ability to operate silently.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
====Animation====
Captain America was one of several Marvel Comics characters which were portrayed in animation in the late 1960s. Captain America’s show even had a theme song, which included the lyrics:
:''When Captain America throws his mighty shield,
:''All those who chose to oppose his shield must yield.
The Captain America character also made two appearances in the 1980s animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', in the episodes &quot;7 Little Superheroes&quot; and &quot;Pawns of the Kingpin&quot;. He also appeared in one episode of the syndicated ''Spider-Man'' series, where he and [[Spider-Man]] fought the Red Skull. Captain America appeared in the fifth season of the ''[[X-Men Animated Series|X-Men]]'' animated series to fend off Nazis as a fellow soldier and friend of Wolverine  in the episode &quot;Old Soldiers&quot;.

Captain America appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[animated television series]], in the &quot;Six Forgotten Warriors&quot; and &quot;Secret Wars&quot; story arcs. In this version, while the original formula was lost, scientists were able to create five similar doses, which were given to five other Americans.  The formula, being imperfect, gave them all slightly different abilities and was also temporary.  The other five could turn off their powers using special rings, to keep from wasting them.  The six fought together in World War II, until Captain America and the Red Skull are trapped in an extra-dimensional stasis device, eternally fighting until they are briefly released.

Captain America (along with [[Nick Fury]]) also made an appearance in the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. In the episode &quot;Operation Rebirth&quot;, Rogers got his abilities from a machine used as part of &quot;Project: Rebirth&quot;.  During World War II, he participated in a joint operation with a Canadian soldier named [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]] to liberate a [[concentration camp]].  One of the prisoners was a boy named Erik Lehnsherr.  After the attack, it was revealed that the ''Rebirth'' process was killing Rogers, so he and Logan destroyed the machine and Rogers was cryogenically frozen until a cure could be found.  Lehnsherr would grow up to become [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and acquire a duplicate of the Rebirth technology, having discovered it could be used safely on mutants to prolong their life and vitality. The duplicate technology was destroyed by Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

*[[Jam band]] [[moe.]] composed a song called &quot;Captain America&quot; which deals with Captain America as an authority figure. 
*[[Jimmy Buffett]] recorded a song in 1977 titled &quot;Captain America,&quot; offering a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the hero, replete with a [[kazoo]] solo and the phrase, &quot;He wears a mask, his clothes are weird, and some folks call him hokey. But he is hip, he just can't dig the [[Oklahoma|Okie]] from [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]].&quot; 
*The [[Guns N' Roses]]' song &quot;[[Paradise City]]&quot; also contains a reference to Captain America (&quot;''Captain America's been torn apart...''&quot;).

====Cinema====
*[[Peter Fonda]]'s character in the iconic 1969 feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was nicknamed Captain America. According to the &quot;making of&quot; feature on the [[DVD]] edition of the film, director [[Dennis Hopper]] described the two motorcyclists of the film to actor [[Robert Walker, Jr.]], who said &quot;they sound like Captain American and Bucky&quot;, and Hopper liked the name.

The first is the Torch of Liberty, who fought Nazis and monsters during World War II, and taught Hellboy how to use a pistol. The second is Lobster Johnson, who ''also'' fought Nazi agents and the supernatural, but before World War II. The major difference between the two heroes is that the Torch was a public hero, and Johnson was officially secret. A series of black &amp; white films were made during and after the war to [[government conspiracy|cover this up]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Christian countercult movement''', also known as '''discernment ministries''' is the collective designation for many mostly unrelated [[religious ministry|ministries]] and individual [[Christian]]s who oppose non-mainstream Christian and non-Christian religious groups, which they often call [[cult]]s.  Motivation for this movement is usually based in doctrinal and theological reasons, and it often with a [[mission|missionary]] or [[apologetics|apologetic]] purpose. Protagonists often come from an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] background, although some are former members of non-mainstream groups. While a considerable proportion of those who identify with the Christian countercult are [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Evangelicals, there are also [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Ancient Oriental Orthodox]] groups critical of cults.

The Christian countercult movement with its emphases on apologetics and evangelism does not constitute the totality of concerns which many Christians have about cult practices. Some Christians share similar concerns to those of the secular [[anti-cult movement]].

==History==
===Precursors &amp; pioneers===
Christians have applied theological criteria to assess the teachings of non-orthodox movements throughout church history. In the Protestant traditions some of the earliest writings opposing unorthodox groups like Swedenborg's teachings, can be traced back to [[John Wesley]], [[Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)]] and [[Princeton Theological Seminary|Princeton]] theologians like [[Charles Hodge]] and [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield]]. The first known usage of the term &quot;cult&quot; by a Protestant apologist to denote a group is heretical or unorthodox is in ''Anti-Christian Cults'' by A. H. Barrington, published in [[1898]]. 

Quite a few of the pioneering apologists were [[Baptist]] pastors, like I. M. Haldeman, or participants in the [[Brethren]], like William Irvine and Sydney Watson. Watson wrote a series of didactic novels like ''Escaped from the Snare:Christian Science'', ''Bewitched by Spiritualism'', and ''The Gilded Lie'', as warnings of the dangers posed by cultic groups. Watson's use of fiction to counter the cults has been repeated by later novelists like [[Frank Peretti]].

The early twentieth century apologists generally applied the words &quot;[[heresy]]&quot; and &quot;[[sect]]s&quot; to groups like the [[Christadelphians]], [[Mormon]]s, [[Spiritualism|Spiritualists]], and [[Theosophy]]. This was reflected in several chapters contributed to the multi-volume work released in [[1915]] ''The Fundamentals'', where apologists criticised the teachings of [[Charles Taze Russell]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] ([[Christian Science]]), the [[Mormons]] and Spiritualists.

===Mid-20th century apologists===
Since at least the [[1940s]], the approach of traditional Christians was to apply the meaning of ''cult'' such that it included those religious groups who use other scriptures beside the Bible or have teachings and practices deviating from traditional Christian teachings and practices. Some examples of sources (with published dates where known) that documented this approach are:

* ''The Missionary Faces Isms'', by John C. Mattes, pub. [[1937]] (Board of American Missions of the [[United Lutheran Church]]).		
* ''Heresies Ancient and Modern'', by J.Oswald Sanders, pub.[[1948]] (Marshall Morgan &amp; Scott, London/Zondervan, Grand Rapids).	
* ''Cults and Isms'', by J.Oswald Sanders, pub.1962, 1969, 1980 (Arrowsmith), ISBN 0551004584.	
* ''The Chaos of Cults'', by J.K.van Baalen, pub. 1938, 1944, 1960, 1962 (Eerdmans)	
* ''Heresies Exposed'', by W.C.Irvine, pub. 1921, 1975 (Loizeaux Brothers).	
* ''Confusion of Tongues'', by C.W.Ferguson, pub. 1928 (Doran &amp; Co).	
* ''Isms New and Old'', by Julius Bodensieck.	
* ''Some Latter-Day Religions'', by G.H.Combs.

One of the first prominent countercult apologists was [[Jan Karel van Baalen]] ([[1890]]-[[1968]]), an ordained minister in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]]. His book, ''The Chaos of Cults'', which was first published in 1938, became a classic in the field.

===Walter Martin===
Historically, one of the most important protagonists of the movement was [[Walter Martin]] (1928-89), whose numerous books include the [[1955]] ''The Rise of the Cults: An Introductory Guide to the Non-Christian Cults'' and the [[1965]] ''The Kingdom of the Cults: An Analysis of Major Cult Systems in the Present Christian Era'', which continues to be influential. He became well known in conservative Christian circles through a radio program, &quot;The Bible Answer Man&quot;, currently hosted by [[Hank Hanegraaff]].

In his 1955 book, Martin gave the following definition of a cult:

:&quot;By cultism we mean the adherence to doctrines which are pointedly contradictory to orthodox Christianity and which yet claim the distinction of either tracing their origin to orthodox sources or of being in essential harmony with those sources. Cultism, in short, is any major deviation from orthodox Christianity relative to the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith.&quot;

As Martin's definition suggests, the countercult ministries concentrate on non-traditional groups that claim to be Christian, so chief targets have been the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]] and the [[Unification Church]], but also smaller groups like the [[Swedenborgian Church]]

Various other conservative Christian leaders&amp;mdash;among them [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Norman Geisler]]&amp;mdash;have emphasized themes similar to Martin's.  Perhaps more importantly, numerous other well-known conservative Christian leaders as well as many conservative pastors have accepted Martin's definition of a cult as well as his understanding of the groups to which he gave that label. (Compare this definition with ''[[heresy]]''.)

== Other technical terminology ==
Since the [[1980s]] the term &quot;new religions&quot; or &quot;[[new religious movements]]&quot; has slowly entered into Evangelical usage, alongside the word &quot;cult&quot;. Some book titles use both terms. 

The acceptance of these alternatives to the word &quot;cult&quot; in Evangelicalism reflects, in part, the wider usage of such language in the [[sociology of religion]]. However, there is no unanimity about whether these terms are synonyms.

== &quot;Countercult apologetics&quot; as accepted term ==
The term &quot;countercult [[apologetic]]s&quot; first appeared in Protestant Evangelical literature as a self-designation in the late [[1970s]] and early 1980s in articles by [[Ronald Enroth]] and David Fetcho, and by Walter Martin in ''Martin Speaks Out on the Cults''. A mid-1980s debate about apologetic methodology between Ronald Enroth and J. Gordon Melton, led the latter to place more emphasis in his publications on differentiating the Christian countercult from the secular anti-cult. Eric Pement urged Melton to adopt the label &quot;Christian countercult&quot;, and since the early 1990s the terms has entered into popular usage and is recognised by sociologists such as Douglas Cowan.

The only existing umbrella organization within the countercult movement in the USA is the [[EMNR]] (Evangelical Ministries to New Religions) founded in 1982 which has the evangelical [[Lausanne Covenant]] as governing document and which stresses mission, scholarship, accountability and networking.

== Countercult outside the USA ==
While the greatest number of countercult ministries is found in the United States of America, ministries exist in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]]. A comparison between the methods employed in the USA and other nations discloses some similarities in emphasis, but also other nuances in emphasis. The similarities are that globally these ministries share a common concern about the evangelisation of people in cults and new religions. There is also often a common thread of comparing orthodox doctrines and biblical passages with the teachings of the groups under examination. However, in some of the European and southern hemisphere contexts, confrontational methods of engagement are not always relied on, and dialogical approaches are sometimes advocated.

==Contextual missiology==
The phenomena of cults has also entered into the discourses of Christian missions and theology of religions. An initial step in this direction occurred in 1980 when the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization convened a mini-consultation in Thailand. From that consultation a position paper was produced [http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=14647''&quot;The Thailand Report on New Religious Movements&quot;'']. The issue was revisited at the Lausanne Forum in 2004 with another paper [http://www.lausanne.org/lcwe/assets/LOP45_IG16.pdf''&quot;Religious and Non-Religious Spirituality in the Western World&quot;'']. The latter paper adopts a different methodology to that advocated in 1980. 

In the [[1990s]] discussions in academic missions and theological journals indicate that another trajectory is emerging which reflects the influence of contextual missions theory. Advocates of this approach maintain that apologetics as a tool needs to be retained, but do not favour a confrontational style of engagement. Instead, by combining insights from missions theory, a cross-cultural approach to dialogue, proclamation and conversion is applied in outreach.  

==Apologetic nuances and models==
Countercult apologetics has several nuances and methods employed in analysing and responding to cults. The different nuances in countercult apologetics have been discussed by John Saliba and Philip Johnson. 

The dominant method is the emphasis on detecting unorthodox or heretical doctrines and contrasting those with the Bible and early creedal documents. Some apologists, such as [[Francis J. Beckwith]], have emphasised a philosophical approach, pointing out logical, epistemological and metaphysical problems within the teachings of a particular group. Another approach involves former members of cultic groups recounting their spiritual autobiographies, which highlight experiences of disenchantment with the group, unanswered questions and doubts about commitment to the group, culminating in the person's conversion to Evangelical Christianity.

Pop apologists like [[Dave Hunt]] in ''Peace, Prosperity and the Coming Holocaust'' and [[Hal Lindsey]] in ''The Terminal Generation'' have tended to interpret the phenomena of cults as part of the burgeoning evidence of signs that Christ's Second Advent is close at hand. Both Hunt, and [[Constance Cumbey]], have applied a conspiracy model to interpreting the emergence of New Age spirituality and linking that to speculations about fulfilled prophecies heralding Christ's reappearance.

Other apologists like [[Bob Larson]] blend an understanding of cults as heresies with a strongly nuanced emphasis on Satan as the energising power behind the growth of cults. This theme has been portrayed in the anti-New Age novels by [[Frank Peretti]] (''This Present Darkness'' and ''Piercing the Darkness'')where demonic forces empower practitioners of New Age groups while Christians engage in spiritual warfare tactics of prayer and exorcisms to counter the groups.

Today there exist many and very diverse countercult ministries and authors including everything between scholars and soapbox preachers and there is no overall agreement regarding which groups are part of traditional Christianity. 

Some Protestants classify [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern-orthodox]], [[Seventh-day_Adventist_Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Pentecostal]] churches as cults, because they allegedly have non-Biblical teachings.

Others speak out mainly against current non-Christian groups or trends in society like the [[New Age]] movement, the popularity of [[Harry Potter]] books or [[Halloween]].

Some ministries, often led by former members, target single groups like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons.

'''Charles Francis Xavier''', also known as '''Professor X''', is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]]  [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is the founder, mentor and sometime leader of the team of [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]]es the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''X-Men'' #1 (1963). 

Xavier is considered one of the most powerful [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]] on Earth due to his [[psionic]] powers. Xavier can read, control and influence human minds and cast [[illusion]]s. He can also detect the presence of other mutants. A natural genius, he is also a leading authority on [[genetics]], [[mutation]], and psionic powers, has considerable expertise in other life sciences and is highly talented in creating equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers.

A visionary, Xavier has devoted his life to helping mutants learn to live with their powers, and to helping mutants and normal humans coexist peacefully and without fear of one another.

Professor Xavier's character is inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]], and may also be a derivative of [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]], or Charles Xavier from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1962 book [[Pale Fire]].

==Character biography==
Professor Xavier is a mutant - one of the world's most powerful [[telepath]]s. As a young man, he was rendered a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] in an accident that was later revealed to have been caused by an alien called [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]]. In addition to his mutant gifts, Xavier is a world-class scientific intellect. His undergraduate education was conducted at [[Harvard University]]; he later did graduate work at [[Oxford University]].

===Early Life===
Charles Xavier was born to Brian and Sharon Xavier, a couple that was wealthy partially due to Brian being a well-respected scientist. After Brian died in a nuclear accident, his science partner Kurt Marko comforted the grieving Sharon and eventually married her. When Xavier's telepathic mutant powers emerged, he discovered Kurt really only cared about her money.

Kurt moved in with the Xaviers, bringing with him his son [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain]]. Kurt eventually showed his true colors, neglecting Sharon, driving her to alcoholism and abusing Charles and Cain. Cain took out his frustrations and insecurities on his step-brother. Charles once used his telepathic powers to read Cain's mind and see his psychological damage, which only led to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him.

Sharon died soon after. Later, a fight erupted between Cain and Charles causing some of Kurt's lab equipment to explode. Mortally wounded, he managed to drag the two children out before dying himself.

Thanks to his telepathy and intellect, Xavier became a brilliant student and athlete, though he gave up the latter after believing his powers gave him an unfair advantage. He later met a fellow student who he fell in love with, a [[Scotland|Scottish]] girl named [[Moira McTaggart|Moira Kinross]], who would later change her last name to 'McTaggart'. The two eventually agreed to get married but Xavier was drafted into the war.  While he was away Moira broke up with him.

===World travels===
After the war, Xavier travelled around the world.  In [[Cairo]] he ran into the [[Shadow King]], who was posing as an Arabian crime lord.  Xavier was able to defeat the Shadow King barely escaping with his life.  This encounter led to Xavier's decision of devoting his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression.

Xavier later visited an old friend, Daniel Shomron, who had opened a clinic for traumatized [[Holocaust]] victims in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].  There, he met the man who would become [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], a Holocaust survivor himself who worked as a volunteer in the clinic and [[Gabrielle Haller]], a catatonic Holocaust survivor.  Xavier was able to use his mental powers to break her out of her catatonia and the two later fell in love.

Xavier also became good friends with Magneto.  Neither revealed to the other the fact that he was a mutant.  The two held lengthy debates hypothesizing what would happen if humanity were to be faced with a new, super-powered, race of humans.  While Xavier was optimistic, Magneto's experiences in the Holocaust led him to believe that humanity would ultimately oppress the new race of humans like they did any other minority.

The two friends revealed their powers to each other when they fought Nazi [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and his [[HYDRA]] agents, who had kidnapped Gabrielle because she had known the location of their secret cache of gold.  Magneto attempted to kill Strucker by dropping the cave in on him; the baron somehow managed to survive and resurfaced much later.  Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations were incompatible, Magneto left with the gold.

Charles continued to stay in Israel for some time, but eventually he and Gabrielle separated on good terms not knowing at the time that she was pregnant with his son, who would grow up to become the [[Autism|autistic]] mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]].

Xavier later encountered the alien [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], foiling his plans for an invasion.  The alien retaliated by dropping a large boulder on Xavier's legs, crushing them and leaving him crippled.  After Lucifer had left, a young woman named [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] heard his telepathic cries for help and rescued him, bringing him to safety. Xavier told her she was a mutant and what that meant.

===The X-Men===
[[Image:Xavxmen.PNG|150px|Xavier with the original team of X-Men; Beast, Iceman, Cyclops, Angel, and Marvel Girl. Art by Jack Kirby.|thumb]]
Xavier founded [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|a school for gifted children]] which had a secret purpose of providing a safe haven for mutants to master their abilities in order to function in the outside world safely. In addition, he sought to foster good mutant-human relations by providing a positive example of mutants with his superhero team, the X-Men. Among the obstacles to that goal was his old friend, Magneto, who had grown harder since the two last met and believed that the only solution to mutant persecution was domination of humanity.

Throughout most of his time with the team, Xavier used his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provided instructions and advice when needed. In addition, he used a special machine called [[Cerebro]], which enhanced his ability to detect mutants and to allow the team to find new students in need of the school. At one point, he seemed to have died but that turned out to be a former villain named [[Changeling (Marvel Comics)|Changeling]], who had agreed to impersonate Xavier while he went into hiding to plan a defense against an impending alien invasion.

Later, Xavier assembled a newer team of X-Men to rescue the original team when they were in trouble and managed the new members as before. He later met and fell in love with the alien Princess [[Lilandra]] from the [[Shi'ar]] Empire and took a sabbatical on her world for a time.

===Rejuvenation===
[[Image:Xavierwalk.png|Xavier starts to walk again. Art by Paul Smith.|150px|thumb]]
Later, Xavier was placed under the control of a member of the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] while the X-Men were fighting them in outer space. During that time, he was compelled to assemble a team of younger mutants collectively called [[The New Mutants]], which were secretly intended to be prime hosts for reproduction of the aliens. Eventually, the X-Men discovered the dire situation and returned to free Xavier, but they were too late to prevent him from being transformed into a Brood Queen. The X-Men and [[Starjammers]] were able to subdue him in this monstrous form, but the only way to restore him was to clone a new body using tissue samples he had previously donated to the Starjammers. This new body had fully-working legs, but he was so accustomed to using his mind to block the previous constant pain of his paralysis that his mind subconsciously gave him [[psychosomatic]] pain whenever he tried to walk, which kept him largely in his wheelchair. Eventually, he overcame this difficulty and sometimes joined the X-Men in the field.

===Leave of absence===
A bit later, Xavier became victim of a [[hate crime]] and was severely injured. [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and her [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] got him to safety. One of the Morlocks managed to partially restore Xavier's health. However, Callisto warned Xavier that he wasn't fully healed and he would need to spend more time recuperating and not exerting his full strength or powers or his health could fail again. Xavier hid his injuries from the others and tried to resume his life. 

A reformed Magneto was arrested and put on trial. Xavier attended the trial to defend his friend. Andrea and Andreas Strucker, the children of Baron Von Strucker — who at the time was presumed dead — crashed the courtroom to attack Magneto and Xavier.  Xavier was seriously injured. Dying, he asked a shocked Magneto to look after the X-Men for him. 

Lilandra, who had a psychic bond with Xavier, felt that he was in great danger and headed to Earth. There, she took Xavier with her and the [[Shi'ar]] so their advanced technology could heal him.

Magneto was left in charge of his school and some of the X-Men were unwilling to forgive their former enemy, mainly the original five X-Men who left and formed a splinter team called [[X-Factor]]. Magneto worked with the X-Men for several years, but when a misunderstanding caused them to attack him, he felt betrayed and became an enemy again.  By this time Xavier had returned to resume his previous responsibilities. He was later injured by his old foe, the [[Shadow King]], returning him to his former paraplegic state.

===Onslaught===
[[Image:onslaught_01.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Onslaught.]]
Professor X was for a time the unknowing host of the evil psionic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

Months before, Magneto and Xavier had had a falling out. The two were angry with each other and things escalated when [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] left the X-Men and joined Magneto and his Acolytes. 

In a battle where the X-Men were fighting Magneto at his base on Avalon, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] tried to kill Magneto who in turn retaliated by ripping out the [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] bonded to Wolverine's skeleton. Furious, Xavier wiped Magneto's mind, leaving Magneto in a coma; Magneto would not regain his mind until several months later. The psionic contact brought together Magneto and Xavier's unrepressed anger at humanity, creating the entity known as Onslaught, a creature of pure psionic energy.

Onslaught wreaked havoc through the earth until he was destroyed by many of Marvel's superheroes, including [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four|the Fantastic Four]] and [[Hulk (comics)|the Incredible Hulk]].

Xavier was left without his telepathy and feeling guilty about his hand in what happened. He left the X-Men for a while.

[[Image:Nx121.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Cassandra Nova.]]

===Cassandra Nova===
Xavier's [[evil twin]] [[Cassandra Nova]], whom Xavier had killed while they were both in their mother's womb, came back and had a group of rogue sentinels destroy Genosha. Magneto, who at the time was the leader of Genosha, presumably died along with everyone else on the island. Nova then took over Xavier's body.

Posing as Xavier, she outed him as a mutant to the world before going into space and crippling the Shi'ar empire. The X-Men managed to restore Xavier, but Lilandra believed that too much trouble had come from her and the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men and had her marriage with Xavier annulled

===New Worlds===
During this period, a mutant named [[Xorn]] had joined the X-Men. His power was apparently to heal and he restored Xavier's use of his legs.

Now outed as a mutant, Xavier began making speeches to the public about mutant tolerance. He also founded the X-Corporation, or X-Corp, with offices all over the world. The purpose of the X-Corp is to watch over mutant rights and help mutants in need. 

As a result of being outed, the school wouldn't have to hide the fact that it was a school for mutants and it opened its doors for more mutants to come in. Things went downhill, however, when a student named Quentin Quire and his gang caused a riot on the day humans were going to take a tour of the school. As a result, Quire and two innocent students were killed. 

Not sure if his dream was working, Xavier told everyone that at the end of the term he would step down as being headmaster and that Jean Grey would be replacing him.

Xorn then revealed himself to be Magneto, though it was later revealed that he was just an impostor. The impostor crippled Xavier once more before destroying New York. The X-Men managed to defeat the impostor, but not before he killed Jean by giving her an electromagnetic stroke.

===Genosha===
[[Image:Excalibur magneto.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Xavier meets up with Magneto. Art from ''Excalibur'' #1.]]

With Jean dead, Xavier left the school to Cyclops and [[Emma Frost]], who had been having a psychic affair behind Jean's back for some time before her death.  Xavier then went to Genosha where he met up with the real Magneto. The two resolved their differences once more and worked together to rebuild and restore order to the decimated island nation.

Back at the mansion, the [[Danger Room]] gained [[sentience]], rechristened itself &quot;Danger&quot;, assumed a humanoid form and attacked the X-Men before heading over to kill Xavier. With Magneto's help Xavier was able to hold Danger off until the X-Men arrived. Soon after Danger fled, but not before revealing to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] that Xavier had known it had been sentient ever since he upgraded it. Colossus was especially hurt, as he had been held captive and experimented on recently.

Ashamed, Xavier tried to explain to them that by the time he realized what was happening, he could see no other course.  The X-Men, disgusted with him, left.

===House of M===
Later, Magneto's daughter the [[Scarlet Witch]] suffered a mental breakdown and killed some of the Avengers. Magneto brought her to Xavier and asked him to use his mental powers to help her. Xavier agreed to try, but was unsuccessful. Worried, he ordered a group meeting of the X-Men and the Avengers to decide Wanda's fate. Her brother, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], believed that the two groups were planning on killing her; and indeed  Wolverine and Emma Frost both believed that that was the best option. Going to Genosha where she was located, he convinced her that she could undo her wrongs by using her powers to change reality into a perfect world. Wanda used her magicks and changed the reality into the [[House of M]], a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority and Magneto their ruler. Here, Magneto and the others believed that Xavier died years ago helping free Genosha.

When Layla Miller, a mutant with the ability to restore people's memories, restored the minds of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they headed over to Genosha where they discovered that Magneto had erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. They were horrified until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] faded into his grave and discovered there was no body.

Believing Magneto was somehow responsible, the two groups attacked Magneto and his forces. After discovering that Magneto was in fact not responsible, Layla restored his memories. When Magneto discovered what had gone on, he became enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name and killed him. Wanda used her magicks to revive him and blamed Magneto for choosing the mutants over them, [his children]. Using her powers, she changed the reality back and caused ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers, leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction.

With reality restored, Xavier was still missing and the X-Men were unable to detect him with Cerebra. Xavier's fate will be revealed in the six issue miniseries, ''[[Deadly Genesis]]''.

==Education==
'''Undergraduate studies''' 
*Charles Xavier graduated with [[Latin honors|honors]] at the age of 16 from [[Harvard University]].
'''Graduate studies''' 
*[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s in [[Genetics]], [[Biophysics]], and [[Psychology]]; two year residence at [[Oxford University]]

==Ultimate Charles Xavier==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Charles Xavier is the world's most powerful telepath, the founder and patron of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] and a world-famous lecturer for [[pacifism]] and mutant [[emancipation]]. In contrast to his mainstream version, he also has limited [[telekinetic]] abilities and most importantly, he is not as saintly and morally inscrutable. He ruthlessly left his wife [[Moira MacTaggert]] with her sick son David to pursue [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] dream of a mutant society, but unfortunately Magneto turned on him because of his belief that humans were the inferior race. This falling out between the two led to Magneto disabling him with a spear. Xavier has also more than once tampered with other people's minds to reach his goals, yet he has recognized his flaws. He generally believes that reading minds without permission is unacceptable.

==Appearances in other media==
[[Image:Profx3.JPG|thumb|150px|Patrick Stewart as Professor X]]
*Xavier appears in the two major animated television adaptations of the comic book, ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' (voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]) and ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' (voiced by [[David Kaye]]). He also appeared in the X-Men pilot cartoon ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'' in the 1980s and was frequently a guest star on the animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.

*In the animated series of ''X-Men: Evolution'', Xavier continues to teach and train mutant students. Instead of being stepbrothers, he is the half-brother of Juggernaut. He was captured by Mystique to replace him so she could exact revenge on Magneto. Xavier was placed in the same prison containment and was found by the X-Men.

*He also appeared in the three live action feature film adaptations ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and the upcoming [[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]. He is played by [[Patrick Stewart]].

*Professor X has appeared in most of the X-Men video game spinoffs. He is almost always an [[non-player character|NPC]] and advises the X-Men on various missions in the role playing games. In the case of the fighting games, he appears in some of the characters' endings. The most notable game for Professor X fans would be the [[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]] game for the Sony Playstation in which he is an unlockable playable character. Also of interest is the  [[X-Men Legends]] game, in which Professor X is the only character to be voiced by the same actor from the movies ([[Patrick Stewart]]). In the first ''Legends'' game, he is a playable character for one level, in ''[[X-Men Legends II]]'', he appears as an NPC but can be unlocked as a playable character once all the Danger Room missions are played.

[[Image:Uploco.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The ''[[Gov. Stanford]]'' locomotive]]
The '''Central Pacific Railroad''', (later to become the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]), was planned by [[Theodore Judah]] and financed mostly through the efforts of &quot;[[The Big Four]]&quot; (''who also called themselves &quot;The Associates&quot;''), who were [[Sacramento, California]] businessmen [[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins]]. It was created to build the [[First transcontinental railroad (North America)|First Transcontinental Railroad]] in [[North America]].  [[Alfred A. Hart]] was the official photographer of the CPRR construction.

A replica of the [[Sacramento, California]] Central Pacific Railroad passenger station is part of the [[California State Railroad Museum]], located in the [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park]]. The company's first two locomotives, the ''[[Gov. Stanford]]'', and ''[[C. P. Huntington]]'', are also both housed at the same museum. 

Nearly all of the company's early correspondence is preserved at Syracuse University as part of the Huntington papers collection, released on microfilm (133 reels). The following libraries have this microfilm: University of Arizona at Tucson; Virginia Commonwealth University at Richmond.

Additional collections of manuscript letters are held at Stanford University and the Mariner's Museum at Newport News, Virginia.

The railroad originally terminated with a connection to the Union Pacific at Promontory Point, Utah.  Shortly after completion of the line the Central Pacific purchased the track from Promontory to Ogden from the Union Pacific so that the railroads could have a terminal in a city.

'''Clairvoyance''' is defined as a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] whereby a person perceives distant objects, persons, or events, including &quot;seeing&quot; through [[opaque]] objects and the detection of types of [[Odic force|energy]] not normally perceptible to humans (i.e. [[radio]] waves). Typically, such perception is reported in visual terms, but may also include auditory impressions (sometimes called ''clairaudience'') or kinesthetic impressions.

The term clairvoyance is often used broadly to refer to all forms of ESP where a person receives information through means other than those explainable by current science. Perhaps more often, it is used more narrowly to refer to reception of present-time information not from another person, there being other terms to refer to other forms: [[telepathy]] referring to reception of information from another person (i.e. presumably mind-to-mind); and [[precognition]] referring to gaining information about places and events in the future. The term ''clairsentience'' is often used in reference to psi phenomena falling under this broader context.

As with all psi phenomena, there is wide disagreement and controversy within the sciences and even within parapsychology as to the existence of clairvoyance and the validity or interpretation of clairvoyance related experiments (see [[Parapsychology]]).

==Clairvoyance through history==

There have been anecdotal reports of clairvoyance and claims of clairvoyant abilities on the part of some throughout history in most cultures. Often these have been associated with religious figures, offices, and practices. For example, ancient Hindu religious texts list clairvoyance as one of the [[siddhi]]s, skills that can be acquired through appropriate meditation and personal discipline. But a large number of anecdotal accounts of clairvoyance are of the spontaneous variety among the general populace. For example, many people report instances of &quot;knowing&quot; in one form or another when a loved one has died or was in danger before receiving notification through normal channels that such events have taken place. Similar presentiments that are not eventually fulfilled are soon forgotten, however. While anecdotal accounts do not provide scientific proof of clairvoyance, such common experiences continue to motivate research into such phenomena.

Clairvoyance was one of the phenomena reported to have been observed in the behavior of ''[[sleepwalking|somnambulists]]'', people who were mesmerized and in a trance state (nowadays equated with hypnosis by most people) in the time of [[Franz Anton Mesmer]]. The earliest recorded report of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the Marquis de Puysegur, a follower of Mesmer, who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Victor reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of other patients, and forgetting everything when he came out of the trance state. All this is in a manner reminiscent of the reported behaviors of the 20th century psychic [[Edgar Cayce]]. It is reported that although Puysegur used the term 'clairvoyance', he did not attribute any of this to the paranormal since he accepted mesmerism as one of the natural sciences.

Clairvoyance was in times following a reported ability of some mediums during the spiritualist period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was one of the aspects studied by members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR). Psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.

While experimental research into clairvoyance began with SPR researchers, experimental studies became more systematic with the efforts of [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] and his associates at Duke University, and such research efforts continue to the present day. Perhaps the best-known study of clairvoyance in recent times was the US government-funded [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] project at SRI/SAIC during the 1970s through the mid-1990s.

Results of some parapsychological studies, such as the remote viewing studies, suggest that clairvoyance does not exist - the original &quot;remote viewing&quot; study was discontinued by the Stanford Research Institute due to lack of evidence. However there are as yet no satisfactory experiments designed that cleanly separate the various manifestations of ESP. Some parapsychologists have proposed that our different functional labels (clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition) all refer to one basic underlying mechanism, although there is not yet any satisfactory theory for what that mechanism would be.

Clairvoyance as a term has its origins from the French word claire, which means &quot;clear&quot;, and voyance, &quot;seeing&quot;. It literally means 'clear seeing' in French.

There is ongoing criticism and debate of all these results in the literature.

== Training ==

Current thinking in clairvoyant circles posits that most are born with clairvoyant abilities but then start to turn them off as children are brought up to adhere to demonstrable social norms. Numerous institutes offer training courses that attempt to revive the abilities present in those early years.

'''Chiropractic''', or '''chiropractic care''', is a system of health care with an underlying principle that health problems can be prevented and treated using [[spinal adjustment]]s in order to correct spinal dysfunction, or [[Vertebral subluxation|subluxation]]s. 

Some chiropractors infer a causal relationship between nerve interference or compression at the spine and subsequent problems in more distant parts or [[organ system]]s regulated by the nerve.  Practitioners of chiropractic are called ''chiropractors'', and in the [[United States of America]] they receive the degree ''Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.)'' and are referred to as [[Doctor (title)|&quot;doctor&quot;]]. Chiropractors are licensed in all jurisdictions of the United States, in addition to many other countries throughout the world.  

There is some objective clinical data and peer-reviewed research that demonstrates the efficacy of certain therapeutic techniques used by chiropractors. The primary therapeutic technique used by chiropractors is joint manipulation (which they term &quot;adjustment&quot;), especially spinal manipulation (which is also used by some other healthcare professions). Spinal manipulation has been shown to have some value in the short-term relief of certain forms of [[back pain|back and neck pain]], [[headache]]s, and other spine-related conditions.  Studies done to demonstrate the efficacy of chiropractic care have produced conflicting results.  For example, a 1979 study showed manipulation of the lumbar spine to have no &quot;superior long-term effect compared to other methods of treatment&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;moritz&quot;&gt;Moritz U (1979). Evaluation of manipulation and other manual therapy. Criteria for measuring the effect of treatment. ''Scand J Rehabil Med'' 11(4):173-9. PMID 161070 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=161070&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2005 study stated that &quot;the inclusion of a chiropractic benefit resulted in a reduction in the rates of surgery, advanced imaging, inpatient care, and plain-film radiographs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson&quot;&gt;Nelson CF, Metz RD, LaBrot T (2005). Effects of a Managed Chiropractic Benefit on the Use of Specific Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures in the Treatment of Low Back and Neck Pain.  ''J Man Phys Ther'' 28(8):564-569. [http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ymmt/article/PIIS016147540500240X/abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like traditional medical care, chiropractic offices are often seen in professional buildings as well as shopping complexes, and the locker rooms of professional and Olympic athletes. [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/24/05/02.html  (Chiropractic at the Winter Olympic Games)]  Medical and chiropractic doctors are found in private practice together partnering as a team for the benefit of the patient.  Some chiropractic doctors also employ massage and physiotherapists as adjuncts to chiropractic care.

Because the chiropractic profession emphasizes the importance of healthy lifestyles and does not prescribe drugs or perform surgery, chiropractic care is appealing to health-conscious Americans. Chiropractic treatment of the back, neck, extremities, and joints has become more accepted as a result of research and changing attitudes about alternative, noninvasive health care practices. [http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos071.htm#outlook] According to a survey released in [[2004]] by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], chiropractic was the fourth most commonly used [[complementary and alternative medicine]] therapy among adults in the [[United States]] (7.5%).{{fn|3}}&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;{{fn|4}}

==History==
The roots of chiropractic care can be traced all the way back to the beginning of recorded time. [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter10.htm] Writings from China and Greece written in 2700 B.C. and 1500 B.C. mention spinal manipulation and the maneuvering of the lower extremities to ease lower back pain. [http://www.betterbacks.com/presentation.htm]  As early as 400 BCE the knowledge of a patient's spine was thought to be important in the treatment of many diseases, with [[Hippocrates]], in his work ''On the Articulations'', writing ''&amp;hellip;knowledge [of the spine] is requisite in many diseases.'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/artic.45.45.html]

Chiropractic was founded by [[Daniel David Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], [[USA]]. Originally working as a [[magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], Palmer tried to find a single cause for 100% of all diseases. He reached a point where he even claimed to have succeeded in this mission: ''A subluxated vertebrae . . . is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases. . . . The other five percent is caused by displaced joints other than those of the vertebral column.'' (From: Palmer DD. The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company, 1910.)

In 1895, Palmer was investigating the [[medical history]] of a deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years prior, he felt a pop in his back and had been nearly deaf ever since. Upon examination, Palmer found what he described as a lump that was sore to the touch. He concluded that this lump was a misalignment in the spine and a possible cause of Lillard's deafness. After Palmer supposedly corrected this misalignment, Lillard could reportedly hear the wheels of the horse-drawn carts in the street below.
(From: Palmer DD. The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic. Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company, 1910.)

Palmer claimed that no other chiropractor had duplicated this feat:
:There was nothing 'accidental' about this as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the expected result was obtained. There was nothing 'crude' about this adjustment; it was specific so much so that no chiropractor has equalled it. [http://collections.ic.gc.ca/heirloom_series/volume5/130-133.htm]

Lillard's own recollection of the event differs significantly from Palmer's recollection:
:For the record, Lillard remembered the incident differently, relating that on the fateful day he had been swapping jokes with a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office. D. D. couldn't help overhearing a conversation loud enough for Harvey's ears, so he came out to join the group and was so amused by one story's punch line that he slapped the janitor on the back with a book he was carrying. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer he believed his hearing had improved, and it was then that Palmer began his experimentation with manipulative procedures. Whatever the exact course of events, Palmer's allegiance quickly shifted from magnetism to manipulation. - James C. Whorton, ''Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America''

The term '''''chiropractic''''' originated when Palmer asked a patient - Rev. Samuel Weed - to come up with a name from the [[Greek language]] to describe his practice. Of the several names submitted to him, Palmer accepted one which combined the words ''chiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning &quot;done by hand&quot;) to describe his adjustment of a [[vertebrae|vertebra]] in the [[spinal column]].

Palmer's interest in [[spiritualism]] had a major role in his claims regarding the spiritual origins of chiropractic. He claimed to have received the principles of chiropractic &quot;from the other world&quot; (during spiritistic seances), from a &quot;supernatural source&quot;, the long dead medical physician, Dr. Jim Atkinson. [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf] [http://www.sherman.edu/research/rsch510/FaultyLogic-in-Chiro.pdf]

While D. D. Palmer founded chiropractic, it is generally recognized that his son, [[B. J. Palmer]], is credited with initiating the research, development and promotion of chiropractic.

Chiropractic has gained general acceptance in the last 40 years as an appropriate treatment for certain back, neck and other spine-related problems. Today, it is covered by many health plans including major medical insurance, car and work-related injuries as well as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the United States.

==Legal History==
For decades, the American Medical Association (AMA) conducted a boycott of chiropractic claiming the practice was &quot;unscientific&quot;. An antitrust suit brought against the AMA in 1976 - [[Wilk v. American Medical Association]] - by a group of chiropractic doctors charged the AMA, as well as the Joint Council on Accreditation of Hospitals and the American College of Physicians, with restraint of trade.  In a landmark decision, the lawsuit was decided in favor of the chiropractic doctors in the Federal Appeals Court, finding the AMA guilty of conspiracy and restraint of trade. The AMA then asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, but the request was refused and the guilty verdict was upheld. The AMA has removed its restrictions on its members, allowing them to refer to, and receive referrals from, doctors of chiropractic.  [http://www.chiro.org/abstracts/amavschiro.pdf &lt;sup&gt;PDF of key transcripts&lt;/sup&gt;]

Nowadays medical physicians and chiropractors look back at their animosity toward each other as a historical process. More and more, the public is demanding that professions work together for the patient's benefit. GPs, orthopedists, neurologists,  radiologists and chiropractors consult with each other regarding patient care. The University of Alabama at Birmingham in association with its School of Medicine has a Chiropractic physician faculty member. They are believed to be the first academic institution to utilize chiropractic and provide services in conjunction with its more traditional medical services.

==Chiropractic subluxation==
Palmer imbued the term &quot;[[Vertebral subluxation|subluxation]]&quot; with a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] meaning. He held that certain dislocations of [[bone]]s interfered with the &quot;[[innate intelligence]]&quot;, a kind of spiritual energy or [[life force]] dependent upon [[God]] that connects the [[brain]] to the rest of the body. Palmer claimed that subluxations interfered with the proper communication of this innate intelligence with the rest of the body, and that by fixing them 100% of all diseases could be treated.

In the mid-[[1990s]] the [http://www.chirocolleges.org/ Association of Chiropractic Colleges] redefined a subluxation as follows: ''&quot;A [[Vertebral subluxation|subluxation]] is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system and general health.&quot;'' In [[1997]] the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research defined a subluxation as &quot;a joint problem (whether a problem with the way the joint is functioning, a physical problem with the joint, or a combination of any of these) that affects the function of nerves and therefore affects the body's organs and general health.&quot;

Most chiropractors subscribe to the principle that the body has an intelligent and self-healing physiology. One result of this is the general chiropractic belief that healthcare interventions should consider the person as a [[holistic health|whole]] and that conservative (non-invasive) treatment approaches should be used where possible.

=====Philosophy of the subluxation=====
Both chiropractic and mainstream medicine hold that much of the body is controlled by [[nerve impulses]] sent to and from the [[brain]] along the [[spinal cord]]. Whether the brain commanding the foot to move, the foot signaling the brain that it is in pain, or even a simple [[patellar reflex]], the spinal cord is involved. Outgoing impulses from the brain pass down the spinal cord and exit through the appropriate [[spinal nerve]] branch held between the [[vertebrae]] on either side of the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves that emerge from the spinal cord; all of which are housed by vertebrae. If the vertebrae are misaligned (subluxated), chiropractic doctors believe that a spinal nerve can be squeezed or pinched and therefore message flow can be compromised. By aligning the vertebrae and removing restrictions on the spinal nerves, chiropractic claims to allow the spinal cord to more effectively relay messages to and from the brain; thus promoting better health.

== Scientific support for chiropractic ==
A study in the October 2005 issue of the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT)[http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ymmt/article/PIIS0161475405002277/abstract] found that chiropractic and medical care have comparable costs for treating chronic low-back pain, with chiropractic care producing &quot;clinically important differences in pain and disability improvement&quot;. A group of chronic low-back patients who underwent chiropractic treatment showed higher pain relief and satisfaction with the care and lower disability scores than a group that underwent medical care. 

A 2002 investigation supports that spinal manipulation may benefit patients afflicted with [[asthma]] [http://www.chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/Manipulation_May_Benefit_Asthma.shtml]. A 2004 case study showed that spinal manipulation may benefit [[ADHD]] patients [http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ymmt/article/PIIS0161475404001642/fulltext]. Advocates of chiropractic claim that other recent case studies and research support chiropractic's claim to be effective with a range of conditions including [[autism]], asthma and [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]][http://www.pacificchiro.com/pacific_chiropractic_and_research/article_autism_asthma.htm], [[Bell's palsy]] [http://journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ymmt/article/PIIS0161475402541129/fulltext], [[glaucoma]] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10951314&amp;dopt=Abstract], [[Crohn's disease]] [http://www.jvsr.com/abstracts/4402-1017_takeda.htm], [[colic]] [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=GatewayURL&amp;_method=citationSearch&amp;_uoikey=B758B-4C708NS-1&amp;_origin=SDEMFRASCII&amp;_version=1&amp;md5=c5d03751c35cce8b54fdf9af77457e0e], [[ulcer]]s [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7930964&amp;dopt=Abstract], and [[Parkinson's disease]] [http://www.erinelster.com/Articles/parkinsons_article%20_10_00.html], and, in one case, a combination of [[cortical blindness]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and recurring [[otitis media]] [http://www.chiro.org/research/FULL/Cortical_Blindness.html].  It's worthwhile to note that [[case study|case studies]] are considered &quot;Class V&quot; evidence by medical science, and are thus the least suggestive of all forms of medical evidence.[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3969/is_200401/ai_n10298227]

==Chiropractic education, licensure, and regulation==
===United States===
In the [[United States]], the Council on Chiropractic Education[http://www.cce-usa.org/] (CCE) is in charge of setting minimum guidelines for chiropractic colleges; however, additional requirements may be needed for a license depending on the [[jurisdiction]] where a chiropractor chooses to practice. In 2005, 15 chiropractic programs and 2 chiropractic institutions in the United States were accredited by the CCE. The process of [[credentialing]] varies widely by country.

Students often enter chiropractic school with a Bachelor's degree, or with three years of post-secondary education in the sciences and other appropriate coursework. However, in 2005 &quot;only one chiropractic college required a baccalaureate degree as an admission requirement.&quot;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1181629] The minimum [[prerequisite]] for enrollment in a chiropractic college set forth by the CCE is 90 semester hours. The minimum cumulative GPA for a student entering a chiropractic college is 2.50. Commonly required classes include: [[language arts|communication or language skills]], [[psychology]], [[social science]] or [[humanities]], [[biology]], [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[chemistry]], and [[physics]]. Other common medical classes are: [[anatomy]] or [[embryology]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[diagnosis]], [[neurology]], [[x-ray]], [[orthopedics]], [[obstetrics]], and [[gynecology]].

In the United States, chiropractic programs require a minimum of 4,200 hours of combined classroom, laboratory, and clinical experience. The last 2 years stress courses in manipulation and spinal adjustment and provide clinical experience in physical and laboratory diagnosis, [[orthopedics]], [[neurology]], geriatrics, [[physiotherapy]], and [[nutrition]]. Coursework in Chiropractic school may also include study in [[gross anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], [[embryology]], [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] in the first half of formal schooling.

Graduates of chiropractic schools have to complete 5 years of schooling and pass 4 national board exams in order to complete their education. To qualify for licensure, graduates of chiropractic schools must sit for State examination. Most State boards require at least 2 years of undergraduate education; an increasing number are requiring a 4-year bachelor’s degree. All boards require the completion of a 4-year program at an accredited chiropractic college leading to the Doctor of Chiropractic degree. Once licensed, most States require chiropractors to annually attend 12 to 48 hours of continuing education courses.

Chiropractic colleges also offer [[Postdoctoral]] training in [[neurology]], [[orthopedics]], [[sports injuries]], [[nutrition]], [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]], industrial consulting, [[radiology]], family practice, [[pediatrics]], and applied chiropractic sciences. Once such training is complete, chiropractors may take specialty exams leading to “diplomate” status in a given specialty including orthopedics, neurology and radiology. Exams are administered by specialty chiropractic associations.

==Practice styles and schools of thought==
Contemporary chiropractic is divided into three schools of thought - straight, mixer, and reform - which differ in their approaches to patient care. All chiropractic approaches are based on non-invasive, non-medication approaches, with many based on the use of manipulation as a treatment for mechanical musculoskeletal dysfunction of the spine and extremities. The three schools of thought do not correspond exactly to the existing membership organizations, but there are clear trends, with adherents tending to favor certain organizations.

The three categorizations are currently used mainly within the profession and in discussions. Since the actual differences are very real, they are explained here for the benefit of the general public, which is generally unaware of these differences:

#'''Straight''' chiropractors primarily concern themselves with [[vertebral subluxation]] correction. Practitioners often use varying vertebral manipulation techniques known as &quot;adjustments&quot; for the purpose of preventive medicine and pain relief. Straight chiropractors hold that only the body can cure the body. By aligning the vertebrae, straight chiropractors believe that they are clearing nerve impulse restrictions and therefore providing a more efficient dialogue between the brain and the rest of the body's systems, thus putting the body in a better position to cure (or heal) itself. Straight chiropractors represent a minority position, and tend to be members of the International Chiropractors Association (ICA), and the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA). 
#'''Mixing''' chiropractors combine contemporary medical diagnosis and treatment with chiropractic adjustments. Mixing style practitioners utilize adjustments to treat chiropractic subluxations, as well as nutrition and naturopathic style remedies for other disorders. Methods used might include ultrasound, TENS, rehabilitation or the use of other diagnostic methods such as [[applied kinesiology|Applied Kinesiology]] (AK). Mixing chiropractic is itself divided into conservative and liberal groups{{fn|2}}. Many mixers are members of the American Chiropractic Association (ACA), but there are also many exceptions.
#'''Reform''' chiropractors are oriented at mainstream medicine,  advocating a highly limited use of chiropractic care primarily for treatment of musculoskeletal conditions only. 

In Australia, one of the first countries to widely accept chiropractic (since 1905), the deliniation into 'Straight' vs 'Mixer' type is all but relegated to history. The above categories are not commonly cited by the profession or the public. 

Most universities teaching chiropractic in Australia, including Palmer in Davenport Iowa, USA, are utilizing rehab methods, exercise and physiological therapeutics and nutrition. The National College (now University) incorporated physical therapy as early as 1912, even before there was a profession bearing its name. The profession here continues to be divided only into specialities. Some do spine-only. Others prefer to do sports and rehabilitation. There are musculoskeletal foci and those who co-manage people with organic problems, MS or cancer along with their regular medical approaches. Spinal and musculoskeletal approaches to health can benefit the WHOLE person, and the general public accepts this. Chiropractic doctors diligently work with other professionals to benefit the patients overall well being.

== Criticism of Chiropractic ==
Some traditional medical practitioners do not believe that chiropractic is science-based. 
There are many possible reasons for this.  Partially this is due to the beliefs of Chiropractors themselves. University of Saskatchewan sociologist Leslie Biggs surveyed Canadian Chiropractors in 1997 and found that 74.3% of those interviewed (n=600) did not believe that controlled clinical trials were the best way to evaluate Chiropractic methods. The same study revealed that 68.1% believed that most diseases are caused by spinal malalignment. [http://www.jcca-online.org/client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/Issue+46_3/$file/Pages173-184.pdf ]

Likewise numerous Chiropractors on the web [http://www.chiroweb.com/find/tellmeabout/colic.html] claim to treat infantile colic. According to a 1999 survey of the Ontario Chiropractic Association (which represents 83% of the Chiropractors in Ontario), 46% treated children for colic.[http://www.ccachiro.org/client/cca/JCCA.nsf/objects/Survey+-March+1999/$file/Pages050-057.pdf]  However in 2001 a Norwegian double-blind study demonstrated that Chiropractic manipulation for infantile colic proved no better than the placebo group. [http://adc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/84/2/138]

Also spinal manipulation for episodic tension headache has shown no significant value beyond placebo in controlled trials. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9820258&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum]

In 1985, [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] (NCAHF), a non-profit healthcare watch-dog group, issued a [http://www.ncahf.org/pp/chirop.html Position Paper] critical of chiropractic. A newer [http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/chiro.html Fact Sheet], authored by William Jarvis, Ph.D., has since been issued in 2001.

===Safety===
As with all interventions, risks may be associated with the practice of [[spinal manipulation]]. These risks, although rare, might include vertebrobasilar accidents, [[stroke]]s, disc herniations, [[vertebra]]l [[fracture]], and [[cauda equina syndrome]], according to ''Harrison's''. Most serious complications occur after cervical (neck) manipulation. The practice of greatest concern is the rotary neck movement, sometimes called &quot;Master cervical&quot; or &quot;rotary break&quot;, which has led to trauma, paralysis, strokes, and death among patients.

The Chiropractic community maintains that serious complications due to manipulation of the cervical spine are rare, being 1 in 3 or 4 million manipulations or fewer.  This is based on an extensive review of spinal manipulation performed by the RAND corporation.  However values in other studies vary, Dvorak cites figures of 1 in 400,000. [http://www.chiro.org/chimages/chiropage/cva-1.html].

With studies of this nature it is difficult to determine what percentage of incidents remain unreported.  The RAND study, for example, assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported.  Dr. Edzard Ernst surveyed all Neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complication occuring within 24 hours after cervical spinal manipulation during the past year.

35 such cases had been seen by the 24 who responded, and none of those cases had been reported.  His survey led him to conclude that underreporting was closer to 100%, rendering estimates &quot;non-sensical.&quot; [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/166/1/40]

A 2001 study in the medical journal ''Stroke'', found that vertebrobasilar accidents (VBAs) are five times more likely to occur in those aged &lt;45 years who have visited a chiropractor within 1 week prior to the VBA, than for controls who have not visited a chiropractor.[http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/5/1054?ijkey=cdde44d2e78d548e9dc106feaad97fa85e056a62&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha]

Commenting on the safety of chiropractic, the report from the New Zealand Commission reported, &quot;We are satisfied that chiropractic treatment in New Zealand is remarkably safe.&quot; (Report of the Commission of Inquiry Into Chiropractic 1979:pg 77)

In [[chemistry]], '''Carbide''' confusingly refers to three different things:

1. The [[polyatomic ion]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, or any salt of such. There is a [[triple]] [[covalent bond]] between the two carbon atoms.

2. The [[monatomic ion]] C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, or any salt of such. This ion is a very strong base, and will combine with four [[proton]]s to form [[methane]]: C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

3. A carbon-containing alloy or doping of a metal or semiconductor, such as steel.
==Examples==

* [[Sodium carbide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Silicon carbide]] (SiC)
* [[Tungsten carbide]] (often called simply ''carbide'')
* [[Cementite]] (iron carbide; Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)
See [[:Category:Carbides]] for a bigger list.

==Types of carbides==

===Methides===

A salt corresponding to the ion C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; can be called a '''methide'''. Methides commonly react with water to form [[methane]].
testing 123

===Acetylides===

A salt corresponding to the ion C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; can be called an '''acetylide'''. Acetylides commonly react with water to form [[acetylene]].

===Compounds that do not fit usual notions of valence or stoichiometry===

===Interstitial carbides===

These are formed with metals; they often have metallic properties.

===Some covalent compounds===

Elements that have similar [[electronegavitity]] form mainly covalent compounds. For example, the compound silicon carbide is mostly covalent; it has similar structure to [[diamond]].

==Properties==

Under conditions of [[standard temperature and pressure]], [[metal]] carbides react strongly with [[water]] to form metal [[oxide]]s or [[hydroxide|hydroxides]] and flammable [[acetylene]] gas, e.g.:

: CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Carbide lamp|Carbide lamps]], an important source of portable subterranean [[lighting|illumination]] for [[mining]] and [[caving]], and in the past for [[lighthouse]] lamps, work through on-demand production and [[combustion]] of [[acetylene]] by the metered addition of [[water]] to calcium carbide.

[[Gas lighting]], using acetylene gas generated from carbide, was used in some homes before the [[incandescent lamp]] came into widespread use. It was also the main source of lighting on [[bicycle]]s and carriages before the widespread availability of electric lamps and batteries. The carbide was prepared industrially by the action of an [[electric arc furnace]] on a mixture of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and [[limestone]].

In the northern, eastern and southern regions of the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]] carbide is used as fireworks. To create an explosion, carbide and water are put in a milk churn with a lid. Ignition is usually done with a torch. Some villages in the Netherlands fire multiple milk churns in a row as an oldyear tradition.

Krulak's staff assignments included: Operations Officer, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines ([[1977]]-[[1978]]); Chief of the Combat Arms Monitor Section, Headquarters Marine Corps, [[Washington, DC]] ([[1978]]-[[1979]]); Executive Assistant to the Director of Personnel Management, Headquarters Marine Corps ([[1979]]-[[1981]]); Plans Office, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific, [[Camp H.M. Smith]], [[Hawaii]] ([[1982]]-[[1983]]); Executive Officer, 3d Marines, 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade; Assistant Chief of Staff, Maritime Pre-positioning Ships, 1st MEB; Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, 1st MEB; and the Military Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Office of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. 

He was assigned duty as the Deputy Director of the [[White House]] Military Office in September [[1987]]. While serving in this capacity, he was selected for promotion to brigadier general in November [[1988]]. He was advanced to that grade on [[June 5]], [[1989]], and assigned duties as the Commanding General, 10th &lt;nowiki&gt;MEB/Assistant&lt;/nowiki&gt; Division Commander, 2d Marine Division, FMF Atlantic, [[Camp Lejeune, North Carolina]], on [[July 10]], [[1989]]. On [[June 1]], [[1990]], he assumed duties as the Commanding General, 2d Force Service Support &lt;nowiki&gt;Group/Commanding&lt;/nowiki&gt; General, 6th MEB, FMF Atlantic and commanded the 2d FSSG during the [[Gulf War]]. He served in this capacity until [[July 12]], [[1991]], and was assigned duty as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (Personnel &lt;nowiki&gt;Management/Personnel&lt;/nowiki&gt; Procurement), Headquarters Marine Corps on [[August 5]], [[1991]]. He was advanced to major general on [[March 20]], [[1992]]. General Krulak was assigned as Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Quantico, on [[August 24]], [[1992]], and was promoted to lieutenant general on [[September 1]], [[1992]]. On [[July 22]], [[1994]], he was assigned as Commander of Marine Forces &lt;nowiki&gt;Pacific/Commanding&lt;/nowiki&gt; General, FMF Pacific, and in March [[1995]] he was nominated to serve as the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]. On [[June 29]], he was promoted to General and assumed duties as the 31st Commandant on [[June 30]], [[1995]].  He was relieved on [[June 30]], [[1999]], by General [[James L. Jones]].

Later in his career he worked for credit card company MBNA.

==Decorations and medals==
General Krulak's decorations and medals included: the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]]; [[Distinguished Service Medal (USA)|Distinguished Service Medal]]; [[Silver Star]]; [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Valor device]] and two gold stars; [[Purple Heart]] with gold star; [[Meritorious Service Medal (USA)|Meritorious Service Medal]]; [[Navy Commendation Medal]]; [[Combat Action Ribbon]]; [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with bronze star; [[National Defense Service Medal]] with one bronze star; [[Vietnam Service Medal]] with silver star and two bronze stars; [[Southwest Asia Service Medal]] with two bronze stars; [[Sea Service Deployment Ribbon]]; [[Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry]]; [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation]] (with Palm); [[Republic of Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Citation]]; the [[Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal]]; the [[Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)]] and the [[Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait)]].

'''Compaq''' was a [[personal computer]] company founded in [[1982]] by [[Rod Canion]], [[Jim Harris (Compaq)|Jim Harris]] and [[Bill Murto]]. During the [[1980]]s Compaq produced some of the first [[IBM PC compatible]] computers at a low-cost. The term &quot;COMPAQ&quot; is an acronym for &quot;'''Comp'''atibility '''a'''nd '''Q'''uality&quot;. It existed as a standalone entity until [[2002]] when it was purchased by [[Hewlett-Packard]].

==History==
===1980s===
Compaq was founded in February [[1982]] by [[Rod Canion]], [[Jim Harris (Compaq)|Jim Harris]] and [[Bill Murto]], three senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer [[Texas Instruments]].  Each invested $1,000 to form the company.  Their first venture capital came from Ben Rosen and Sevin-Rosen partners. It is often told that the architecture of the original Compaq PC was first sketched out on a placemat by the founders while dining in the Houston restaurant, House of Pies.

[[Image:CompaqPortable.jpg|thumb|right|[[Compaq Portable]]]]In November [[1982]] Compaq announced their first product, the [[Compaq Portable]], a portable [[IBM PC compatible]] [[personal computer]]. It was released in March [[1983]] at $2995, considerably more affordable than competitors at the time. The Compaq Portable was one of the progenitors of today's [[laptop]]. It was the second IBM PC compatible, being capable of running all software that would run on an [[IBM PC]]. It was a commercial success, selling 53,000 units in its first year. The Compaq Portable was the first in the range of the [[Compaq portable series]]. Compaq was able to market a legal IBM clone because [[IBM]] mostly used &quot;off the shelf&quot; parts for their [[IBM PC|PC]]. Furthermore, [[Microsoft]] had kept the right to license [[MS-DOS|the operating system]] to other computer manufacturers. The only part which had to be duplicated was the [[BIOS]], which Compaq did legally by using [[reverse-engineer|reverse-engineering]] for $1 million. Numerous other companies soon followed their lead.

In [[1985]] Compaq released the [[Compaq Deskpro 286]], a 16-bit [[desktop computer]] using an [[Intel 80286]] microprocessor running at 6&amp;nbsp;MHz and capable of 7MB RAM, it was considerably faster than an [[IBM PC]] and was, like the [[Compaq Portable]], also capable of running IBM software. It cost $2000 for the 40MB hard disk model. It was the first of the [[Compaq Deskpro]] line of computers.

[[Image:CompaqPortable386.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Compaq Portable 386]]]]After making half a billion dollars turnover, in [[1986]] Compaq released the [[Compaq Portable II]]. The Portable II was significantly lighter and smaller than its predecessor, featuring a revised design with an 8&amp;nbsp;MHz processor and 10MB hard disk. It was cheaper than the [[IBM PC/AT]] at $3199, or $4799 with a hard disk. A year later in [[1987]], Compaq introduced the first PC based on [[Intel]]'s new [[Intel 80386|80386]] microprocessor, with the [[Compaq Portable 386]] and [[Compaq Portable III]]. IBM was not yet using this processor, and subsequently Compaq established what was known disparagingly as the [[PC clone]] business.

===1990s - Present===
In the early-[[1990s]], Compaq entered the retail computer market with the [[Presario]], and was one of the first manufacturers in the mid-1990s to market a sub-$1,000 PC. In order to maintain the prices it wanted, Compaq became the first first-tier computer manufacturer to utilize CPUs from [[AMD]] and [[Cyrix]]. The price war resulting from Compaq's actions ultimately drove numerous competitors, most notably [[IBM]] and [[Packard Bell]], from the marketplace.

In [[1997]], Compaq bought [[Tandem Computers]], known for their [[NonStop]] server line. This acquisition instantly gave Compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market. In [[1998]], Compaq acquired [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], the leading company in the previous generation of computing during the [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]]. This acquisition made Compaq, at the time, the world's second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue.  Unfortunately for the company, CEO [[Eckhart Pfeiffer]], who engineered both mergers, had little vision for what the combined companies should do, or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity, and Compaq struggled as a result.  Pfeiffer was forced out as CEO in [[1999]] in a coup led by board chairman Ben Rosen and was eventually replaced by [[Michael Capellas]], formerly CIO of the company.  Capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the Pfeiffer era, but the company still struggled against lower-cost competitors such as [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]].

In [[2001]], Compaq engaged in a merger with [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Numerous large HP shareholders, including Walter Hewlett, publicly opposed the deal, which resulted in a nasty proxy battle between those for and against the deal.  The merger was approved only after the narrowest of margins, and allegations of vote buying (primarily involving an alleged last-second back-room deal with [[Bank of America]]) haunted the new company.  Capellas left the company after serving less than a year as President of HP.  [[Carly Fiorina]], the CEO of HP, added Capellas' responsibilities to her own.  Fiorina helmed Compaq for nearly three years after Capellas left. During that time, HP laid off thousands of former Compaq employees, its stock price generally declined, profits did not perk up, and it continued to lose market share to [[Dell Inc.|Dell]].  Facing dismissal from a hostile Board of Directors, Fiorina opted to leave in February 2005 before the board could fire her. Mark Hurd took her place as CEO of HP.  Some Compaq products were re-branded with the HP nameplate, while the Compaq brand remained on other products, notably [[IBM PC|PC]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], and [[server]] lines.

* [[Compaq Armada]]
* [[iPAQ]]
* [[Compaq Deskpro]]
* [[Compaq Portable]]
* [[Compaq Professional Workstation AP400]]
* [[Tc1000]], a tablet notebook

== Culture ==
Two sports stadiums were named after the company:
* The [[Compaq Center (Houston)|Compaq Center]], of [[Houston, Texas]], formerly The Summit, lost its sports teams to the [[Toyota Center]]. The building became the new home of [[Lakewood Church]], one of the largest [[Protestant]] congregations in the United States. 
* The [[San Jose Compaq Center]], of [[San Jose, California]], was renamed the [[HP Pavilion]].

== Competitors ==
HP Compaq competes against other computer manufacturers including [[Alienware]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Sony]] and [[Toshiba]] among others. Originally the company competed against [[IBM]], making affordable [[IBM PC compatible]]s often cheaper and faster than the IBM alternative.  [[Lenovo]], which purchased IBM's personal computer business in [[2005]], is a new competitor, especially in [[China]] where it is headquartered.

A '''cell incubator''' is an apparatus used to grow and maintain [[cell culture]]s. The incubator keeps cultures at an optimal [[temperature]] and [[humidity]]. Many will also regulate the [[carbon dioxide]](CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere inside, in which case they are also called ''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incubators''. Cell incubators are essential for a lot of experimental work in [[cell biology]] and [[molecular biology]] and are used to culture both [[Bacteria|bacterial]] as well as [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells. For mammalian cells, the chamber temperature is typically set to 37° C, the relative humidity is &gt;95% and a slightly acidic [[PH|pH]] is achieved by maintaining a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level of 5%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cult suicide''' is that phenomenon by which some religious groups, in this context often referred to as &quot;[[cult]]s&quot;, have led to their membership committing [[suicide]]. Sometimes all members commit suicide at the same time and place. Groups which have done this include, [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]], [[Order of the Solar Temple]], [[Peoples Temple]] ([[Jonestown]]), and the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]]. In other cases certain denominations apparently supported mass suicide, but did not necessarily encourage all members to do it. Examples here include [[Filippians]], the [[Taiping]], and a few others.

==Known Cult Suicides==

===Peoples Temple (Jim Jones)===

In [[1978]], 914 American followers of [[Jim Jones]] died in a [[mass murder]]/[[suicide]] in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]].  The dead included 274 children.  Alternative theories allege that most of  the victims were unwillingly injected with the poison, and some even allege involvement of the [[CIA]].  However, an affadavit made by former member [[Deborah Layton]] days before the massacre testified to suicide drills called ''white nights'' in which members practiced mass suicide by ingesting poison, and in Jones' final speech, recorded on cassette tape, he states &quot;So my opinion is that you be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece...&quot; stating the intention that the group kill themselves while casting it as a political act:  &quot;We didn't commit suicide, we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.&quot;

=== Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God ===

On [[March 17]] [[2000]], between 780 and 1000 members of the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]] died in a probable mass suicide in [[Uganda]]. The group had splintered from [[Roman Catholicism]] to emphasize [[apocalypticism]] and alleged [[Marian apparitions]]. They also deemed the wider world to be corrupt, seeing themselves as a [[Noah's Ark]] of purity. Along these ends members severely restricted their speech to avoid saying anything dishonest or sinful. Curiously, the group had a feast that involved large quantities of [[Coca-Cola]] and beef before dying.

===Solar Temple===

From [[1994]] to [[1997]], the [[Order of the Solar Temple]]'s members became so paranoid they began a series of mass suicides, which led to roughly 74 deaths. Farewell letters were left by members, stating that they believed their deaths would be an escape from the &quot;hypocrisies and oppression of this world.&quot; Added to this they felt they were &quot;moving on to [[Sirius]].&quot; Interestingly, a mayor, a journalist, a civil servant, and a sales manager were among the dead. Records seized by the Quebec police showed that some members had personally donated over $1 million to the cult's leader, Joseph Di Mambro. There was also another attempted mass suicide of the remaining members, which was thwarted in the late 1990s. All the suicide/murders and attempts occurred around the dates of the equinoxes and solstices, which likely held some relation to the beliefs of the group.

===Heaven's Gate===

On [[March 26]] [[1997]], 39 followers of the [[Heaven's Gate (cult)|Heaven's Gate]] cult died in a mass suicide near [[San Diego, California]].  In the beliefs of the cult, this was not an act of self-extermination; they believed that they were merely &quot;exiting their human vehicles&quot; so that their souls could go on a journey aboard a spaceship they believed to be following [[comet Hale-Bopp]].  Some male members of the cult underwent voluntary [[castration]] in preparation for the genderless life they believed awaited them after the suicide.

On [[March 30]] [[1997]], Robert Leon Nichols, a former roadie for the [[Grateful Dead]], was discovered dead in his California trailer, with a note nearby that read in part &quot;I'm going to the spaceship with Hale-Bopp to be with those who have gone before me.&quot;  Using propane gas rather than vodka and [[phenobarbital]] to end his life, Nichols, like the cult members, had his head covered by a plastic bag and his upper torso covered with a purple shroud.  Nichols' connection with the cult is unknown.

In May 1997, two cult members who had not been present for the mass suicide attempted suicide, one succeeding in the attempt, the other going into [[coma]] for two days and then recovering.  In February 1998 the survivor, Chuck Humphrey, attempted suicide, this time succeeding.

==Suspected Cult Suicides==

===Branch Davidians===

The April 1993 deaths of the [[Branch Davidians]] near [[Waco, Texas]] was deemed to be a cult suicide by varied media sources. Many, however, reported that what happened is unknown and could have been some sort of accident or panic rather than an intentional cult-suicide. Others assign blame to the [[United States government]]. Still others believe it was actually murder-suicide committed by the group's leaders. In any event, it's widely agreed that most or all members did in fact die violent deaths of some kind.

===World Church of the Creator===

[[Ben Klassen]] formed the [[white supremacist]] group currently called the [[Creativity Movement]]. He wrote a book called ''The White Man's Bible'' which called suicide &quot;an honorable and dignified way to die for any ... of a number of reasons, such as having come to the decision that life is no longer worthwhile.&quot; After the death of his wife he practiced what he preached and committed suicide. A former member named [[Benjamin Nathaniel Smith]] committed suicide after a spree killing.

===Scientology===

A considerably weaker suspicion indicates [[Scientology]] caused a number of suicides actively, or through negligence. For example, according to [[Flo Conway]], a researcher at the [[University of Oregon]], Scientologists are taught that if they abandon the &quot;church&quot; they will soon kill themselves or have a serious illness or accident. Her research is said to conclude that they create suicidal people because &quot;Former Scientologists had the highest rates of persistent fear, sleeplessness, suicidal and self-destructive tendencies, violent outbursts, hallucinations and delusions, compared to ex-members of other religious groups.&quot;  Ex-members have also claimed (most notably in the [[Fishman Affidavit]]) that the Church of Scientology ordered them or others to commit &quot;end of cycle&quot; (suicide) in order to protect the Church.

In its cover story on Scientology on [[May 5]], [[1991]], ''Time'' magazine noted the case of [[Noah Lottick]], who committed suicide by jumping from a tall building.  The magazine stated that he clutched in his fist &quot;practically the only money he had not yet given to the Church of Scientology.&quot; Former church member [[Philip Gale]] similarly committed suicide, by jumping out of a tall building.  He chose to kill himself on [[March 13]], Scientology's most important annual holiday marking the birthday of its founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. 

Critics of this theory state that this means that any religious practice which leads to death, or that rejects [[apostasy]], would taint the faith as having cult suicide. For example, deaths attributed to [[Christian Science]]' position against medical advice, or to a recent botched [[exorcism]] by a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest.

==Questionable Cult Suicides==

===The Family International===

A less widespread suspicion indicates that The Family International, previously called [[The Children of God]], encourages suicide despite its official rejection of actions like [[euthanasia]]. However the [[Beliefs of the Children of God]] emphasizes an imminent [[Second Coming]] and some deem this a negative sign with regards to suicidal behavior. Also the religion recently gained renewed attention due to the murder-suicide of [[Ricky Rodriguez]]. Mr. Rodriguez was a former member, but this event gained notice as he was the biological son of current leader [[Karen Zerby]] and the adopted son of the group's founder. It revived allegations that the group is abusive and inciting of suicidal ideation. Thus his death was widely called &quot;the suicide of a cult member&quot; or in a sense a &quot;cult suicide&quot;, but this view was far from universal. This case, arguably and in an exaggerated way, made it to popular culture in an oblique reference in one of the last episodes of the [[NBC]] show [[Third Watch]]. 

Defense of their group indicate Mr. Rodriguez was an aberrant former member and that his behavior is not typical of the group. Added to this tFI/CoG discourages suicide. Other defences state that there is no evidence to confirm the suspicion their members are unusually suicidal.

=== Falun Gong ===

[[Xinhua News Agency]] has alleged several times that practitioners of [[Falun Gong]] engage in &quot;cult suicide&quot;. The most noteworthy allegations came in January 2001 when the Chinese government claimed that at least six Falun Gong practitioners immolated themselves on the [[Tiananmen square]].

Falun Gong practitioners have disputed this and insist that the practice teaches against suicide. They believe that the self-immolators were never practitioners, or possibly were killed by the authorities. The United Nations' International Education Development (IED) at the UN Human Rights Commission in August 2001 has verified these allegations and stated: &quot;We have obtained a video of that incident that in our view proves that this event was staged by the government.&quot;

A documentary film entitled &quot;False Fire&quot; has been released to question the official claims of the Chinese Communist Party.[http://www.faluninfo.net/tiananmen/immolation.asp] Outside observers tend to side with Falun Gong practitioners and reject the idea that the group engages in cult suicide, and have instead criticized the Chinese government for its crackdown of the Falun Gong movement.

== Martyrdom ==

Some argue that [[martyrdom]], as found in religions such as [[Christianity]] or [[Buddhism]] or [[Islam]], is tantamount to suicide. This argument states that by accepting or even inviting their own death the martyr is committing something like [[assisted suicide]]. This theory is not in itself new. [[Richard Marius]]'s unflattering biography of [[Thomas More]] indicated More felt hesitant about accepting martyrdom too easily for fear that would be too similar to suicide. Although it has gained more currency in modern times.

In any event most mainstream religions traditionally forbid members to take their own lives. Martyrdom generally involves losing one's life, usually passively, at the hands of non-believers because of one's religious beliefs or practices. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] considers life to be a gift whose sole &quot;owner&quot; would be [[God]], who is consequently the only individual who may legitimately decide when to interrupt it. Special cases exist, such as the giving of one's own life to save that of another, but most cultures do not consider such acts to be true suicides.

Islam arguably has the harshest view of suicide of any major religion. Therefore some of the lowest suicide rates are found in Muslim nations like [[Jordan]] or [[Egypt]].
[http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/charts/en/index.html]
Still the extreme [[Islamist]] movement has strongly encouraged many [[Muslim]]s to accept a theology in which becoming a [[suicide bomber]] is not considered suicide. Instead it is what's the extremists deem a &quot;martyrdom operation&quot; the purpose of which is to kill the enemies and in consequence yourself. 

Dozens of Muslims, primarily Palestinians and [[Saudi Arabia]]ns, have died in the act of killing both military personnel and civilians in this fashion over the last decade, mostly in the [[Middle East]].  Recently 19 died in such a way in the [[United States]] (see ''[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]]'').  Still a word of caution should be mentioned here as in many dispute the goal is primarily religious, especially in the case of Palestinians. 

Outside of Western religion the [[Tamil Tigers]] are known to have engaged in suicide bombing. At times Western observers have deemed [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] to be a cult-like [[Hindu]] figure who encourages suicide. Therefore they deem the [[LTTE]], rightly or wrongly, as like a cult-suicide group. Even if again the goal is largely political and destructive of others rather than self.

Related to this some would indicate that if &quot;martyrdom&quot; is ever directly self-inflicted it becomes cult-suicide. This line of thought leads to debates about whether the [[self-immolation]] of [[Buddhist monk]]s in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] was cult suicide. One camp believes that in a sense it was cult suicide, but the other dispute this as it was ultimately a political action rather than a religious one. This argument could also apply to suicide bombers as that action is generally political. However added to this the self-immolation was of an individual rather than condoned by the leadership of a group. No recognized [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[organization]] is known to have requested that [[Thích Quảng Ðức]], for example, immolate himself. 

Mass suicide can also occur as a means of escape when a religious group perceives itself to be hopelessly besieged by its enemies or other adverse external pressure.  These external foes may be real or imagined (see ''[[Masada]]'').  The legend of Masada, and similar examples, are sometimes explicitly used by cult-suicides as a self-justification.  They may feel that like Masada they are in danger from what they perceive as an evil empire, even if that evil empire is seen as imaginary by the vast majority of non-members.  That death is therefore preferrable to surrender.  Hence criticisms have arisen over the occasional glorification of Masada.

It should also be mentioned that most of the larger &quot;cults&quot;, such as the Mormons, the Unification Church, and the Seventh Day Adventists, have rates of suicide far lower than that of the population as a whole, which is about 5 per 100,000 per year in the USA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Coup}}

A '''''coup d'état''''' (pronounced {{IPA|/ku de'ta/}}), or simply a '''[[Wiktionary:coup|coup]]''', is the sudden overthrow of a [[government]] against the
[[volonté générale]] formed by the majority of the [[citizenry]], usually done by a smaller supposedly weaker body that just replaces the top power figures. It may or may not be violent in nature. It is different from a [[revolution]], which is staged by a larger group and radically changes the political system. The term is [[French language|French]] for &quot;a (sudden) blow (or strike) to a state&quot; (literally, ''coup'', hit, and ''état'', [[state]]). The term ''coup'' can also be used in a casual sense to mean a gain in advantage of one nation or entity over another; e.g. an ''intelligence coup''. By analogy, the term is also applied to corporations, etc; e.g. a ''boardroom coup''.

Since the unsuccessful coup attempts of [[Wolfgang Kapp]] in [[1920]], and of [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[1923]], the [[Swiss German]] word &quot;'''Putsch'''&quot; (originally coined with the [[Züriputsch]] of [[1839]]) is often used also, even in [[France]] (such as the putsch of [[November 8]], [[1942]] and the putsch of [[April 21]], [[1961]], both in [[Algiers]]), while the direct German translation is ''Staatsstreich''.

[[Tactics|Tactically]], a coup usually involves control of some active portion of the [[military]] while neutralizing the remainder of a country's armed services.  This active group captures or expels leaders, seizes physical control of important government offices, means of communication, and the physical [[infrastructure]], such as streets and power plants. The coup succeeds if its opponents fail to dislodge the plotters, allowing them to consolidate their position, obtain the surrender or acquiescence of the populace and surviving armed forces, and claim [[legitimacy]].

Coups typically use the power of the existing government for its own takeover. As [[Edward Luttwak]] remarks in his ''Coup d'état:  A practical handbook'': &quot;A coup consists of the infiltration of a small but critical segment of the state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder.&quot; In this sense, use of military or other organized force is not the defining feature of a coup d'état. Any seizure of the state apparatus by extra-legal tactics may be considered a coup, according to Luttwak.

==History==
Coups have long been part of political tradition. Indeed, [[Julius Caesar]] orchestrated a coup and was subsequently the victim of another coup. Many Roman emperors, such as [[Claudius]], came to power in coups, as did King [[Jehu]] of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]].  In the November of 1799, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] staged a coup and seized power in France.

In the late [[20th century]] coups occurred most commonly in [[developing country|developing countries]], particularly in [[Latin America]] (e.g. [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]]), [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] ([[Pakistan]]), but also in the Asia Pacific ([[Fiji]] and the [[Philippines]]) and in Europe (e.g. [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the [[Soviet Union]]). Since the [[1980s]], the coup has been seen somewhat less frequently. A significant reason is the general inability to resolve the economic and political problems of developing nations, which has made armed forces, particularly in Latin America, much more reluctant to intervene in politics. Hence, in contrast to past crises, the armed forces have sat on the sidelines through economic crises such as the [[Asian financial crisis]] in [[Thailand]] in [[1998]] or the [[South American economic crisis of 2002|Argentine crisis]] of [[2002]] and have tended to act only when the military perceives itself as institutionally threatened by the civilian government, as occurred in Pakistan in [[1999]]. 

Coups d'état have often been seen as a means for powerful nations to assure favorable outcomes in smaller foreign states. In particular, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and Soviet [[KGB]] developed a reputation for supporting coups in states such as Chile and [[Afghanistan]], respectively. Such actions are substitutes for direct military intervention which would have been more politically unpopular. The governments of France and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] have engineered coups as well.

==Recent forms of coup==
In recent years, use of the traditional military coup has declined. A new, more contemporary form of military intervention which some regard as a coup d'état is simple ''threat'' of military force to remove a particularly unpopular leader. This has occurred twice in the Philippines. In contrast to previous coups d'état, the military does not directly assume power, but rather serves as an arbiter for civilian leaders.

In [[Mauritania]] a white coup d'état happened on [[August 3]], [[2005]] when the president was in [[Saudi Arabia]].

In recent years mass street [[protest]]s have also often been able to force unpopular and corrupt leaders from office in a coup-like fashion. In situations of this sort, such as in [[Serbia]] ([[2000]]), [[Argentina]] ([[2001]]), [[Bolivia]] ([[2003]]), [[Ukraine]] ([[2004]]&amp;ndash;[[2005]]), [[Lebanon]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]] ([[2005]]), popular uprisings simply forced the sitting president to resign his office, causing someone new to assume the presidency. This often results in a period of stability and calm, in which an unknown and uncontroversial vice president can rule the nation until new elections can be held.

In 2002 the United States allegedly supported a coup in [[Venezuela]] against President [[Hugo Chávez]], despite Chávez having been elected by popular vote in two consecutive elections. The coup failed, mainly due to sizable public protests in support of Chávez which dwarfed rallies launched by his opponents. Chávez was returned to office two days after the coup, the provisional military [[junta]] was dissolved, and the democratic government survived a [[referendum]] on new elections by a large margin. In cases such as these, popular protests have been able to prevent coups and place popular leaders back in office.

==Types of coups==

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] has divided coups into three types (ignoring Luttwak's non-military coups)

* '''Breakthrough coups''' - In which a revolutionary army overthrows a traditional government and creates a new bureaucratic elite.  Breakthrough coups are generally led by [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) or junior officers and only happen once.  Examples include [[China]] in [[1911]], [[Egypt]] in [[1952]], Greece in [[1967]] and [[Liberia]] in [[1980]].

* '''Guardian coups''' - These coups have been described as [[musical chairs]].  The stated aim of this form of coup is to improve public order, efficiency, or to end corruption.  There is usually no fundamental shift in the structure of power, and the leaders of these types of coups generally portray their actions as a temporary and unfortunate necessity. Many nations with guardian coups undergo many shifts between civilian and military governments. Examples include  Pakistan, [[Turkey]], and [[Thailand]].

* '''Veto coups''' - These coups occur when the army vetoes mass participation and social mobilization.  In these cases the army must confront and suppress large-scale and broad-based opposition and as a result they tend to be repressive and bloody. Examples include [[Chilean coup of 1973|Chile in 1973]] and Argentina in [[1976]], as well as the overthrow of President [[Fujimori]] of Peru in [[2000]]. An abortive and botched veto coup occurred in [[Venezuela]] in [[2002]].

Coups can also be classified by the level of the military that leads the coup. Veto coups and guardian coups tend to be led by senior officers. Breakthrough coups tend to be led by junior officers or NCOs. In cases where the coup is led by junior officers or enlisted men, the coup is also a [[mutiny]] which can have grave implications for the organizational structure of the military.

There is also a category known as '''bloodless coups''' in which the mere threat of violence is enough to force the current government to step aside. Bloodless coups are so called because they involve no violence and thus no bloodshed.  [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[18 Brumaire]] coup is often pointed out as an example of bloodless coup, showing that bloodless coups are not always considered to be &quot;bloodless&quot;: on 18 Brumaire, several members of parliament were thrown out the windows of the building where they assembled.  More recently, [[Pervez Musharraf]] of Pakistan came to power in a bloodless coup in [[1999]].

The term '''[[self-coup]]''' is used when the current government assumes extraordinary powers not allowed by the legislation. An example is [[Alberto Fujimori#Self-coup|Alberto Fujimori]] in [[Peru]], who was democratically elected, but later took control of the legislative and judicial powers, or the coup of French 
Emperor [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte]] in [[1851]] against the powerful [[National Assembly]]; some argue that the assumption of &quot;emergency powers&quot; by [[King Gyanendra]] of [[Nepal]] is a self-coup.

==Post-military-coup governments==
After the coup, the military is faced with the issue of the type of government to establish. In Latin America, it was common for the post-coup government to be led by a [[junta]], a [[committee]] of the chiefs of staff of the various armed forces.  A common form of African post-coup government is the revolutionary assembly, a quasi-legislative body made of members elected by the army. In Pakistan, the military leader typically assumes the title of chief [[martial law]] administrator.  

According to Huntington, most coup leaders act under the concept of ''right orders'': they believe that the best way to solve the problems their country is facing is to issue correct orders. This view of government underestimates the difficulty in implementing government policy and the amount of possible political resistance to certain orders.

'''Chester Burton &quot;Chet&quot; Atkins''' ([[June 20]], [[1924]] &amp;ndash; [[June 30]], [[2001]]) was an influential [[guitarist]] and [[record producer]]. His virtuoso picking style inspired by [[Merle Travis]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[George Barnes]] and [[Les Paul]], brought him admirers both within and outside the country scene. Atkins produced records for [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Connie Smith]], and [[Waylon Jennings]] to name a few. Atkins created, along with [[Owen Bradley]], the smoother country music style known as the [[Nashville sound]], which expanded country music's appeal to include adult pop music fans as well.

==Biography==
Atkins was born in [[Luttrell, Tennessee]], and grew up with his mother and siblings after the divorce of his parents. He started out on the fiddle, but traded his stepfather a rifle for a guitar when he was nine. Forced to relocate to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to live with his father due to a near-fatal [[asthma]] attack, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. He became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school. Atkins was self-taught, and later on in life gave himself (along with [[Tommy Emmanuel]], Jerry Reed and John Knowles) the honorary degree &quot;CGP&quot;, standing for &quot;Certified Guitar Picker&quot;. 
He didn't have a strong style of his own until he heard Merle Travis picking over [[WLW]] radio in 1939, when Atkins was still living in Georgia.  After graduating high school in 1942, his half-brother Jim, a successful guitarist (who worked with the [[Les Paul]] Trio in New York) helped get him a job at [[WNOX]] radio in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. There he played fiddle and guitar with singer Bill Carlisle and comic [[Archie Campbell]] as well as becoming a member of the station's &quot;Dixieland Swingsters,&quot; a small swing instrumental combo.
 
After three years, he moved to [[WLW]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.  After six months he moved to Raleigh and worked with Johnnie and Jack before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman, who soon fired him. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly &quot;country.&quot; 

Relocating to Chicago, he auditioned for [[Red Foley]], who was leaving his star position at the [[WLS National Barn Dance]] to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Atkins made his first appearance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[1946]] as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based Bullet Records that year. That single, &quot;Guitar Blues,&quot; was fairly progressive, including as it did, a clarinet solo by Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. Atkins moved on to [[KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]], but despite the support of executive Si Siman, soon was fired for not sounding country enough. 

While working with a Western Band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor]]. Si Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]], to sign Atkins, as his style, with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist, was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&amp;R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down to Denver. He made his first RCA recordings in Chicago in 1947.  They did not sell. He did extensive studio work for RCA that year but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with [[Homer and Jethro]] on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show the Tennessee Barn Dance.  In 1949 he left WNOX to join 
[[June Carter#With Mother Maybelle &amp; the Carter Sisters|Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters]] back at KWTO.  This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen and Anita.  Their work soon attracted attention from the Opry.  The group relocated to [[Nashville]] in mid-1950. Atkins began working on recording sessions, performing on [[WSM]] and the Opry.

While he hadn't had a hit record on RCA his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes when the New York-based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA artists.  Atkins's first hit single was &quot;[[Mr. Sandman]],&quot; followed by &quot;Silver Bell,&quot; which he did as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular. In addition to recording, Atkins became a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], who manufactured a Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955-1980.
Atkins also became manager of RCA's Nashville stuido.

When Steve Sholes took over pop production in [[1957]], a result of Sholes's success with [[Elvis Presley]], he left Atkins in charge of RCA's Nashville division.  It was then that Atkins and Owen Bradley, seeing country music record sales in tatters as rock and roll took over, came up with the idea of eliminating fiddles and steel guitar  as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. Atkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits like [[Jim Reeves]]'s &quot;Four Walls&quot; and &quot;He'll Have to Go&quot; and [[Don Gibson]]'s &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; and &quot;Blue Blue Day.&quot;  The concept of having a country hit &quot;cross over&quot; to pop success became a formula. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.

Atkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and jazz, in a home studio, recording the rhythm tracks as RCA but working on them repeatedly until they satisfied him. Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas.  Atkins style, which was and is very difficult for the &quot;backyard guitarist&quot; to master, uses the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand.  He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis.  He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which actually was exactly how Travis played) and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers - and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.  He enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians which led to them being asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in [[1960]]. That performance was canceled, however, due to rioting. Atkins performed at the [[White House]] in [[1961]]. 

Before his mentor, Sholes, died in [[1968]], Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]] and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s. He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[Civil Rights Movement]] sparked violence throughout the South by signing country music's first African-American singer: [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered. But Atkins's hunch paid off. Ironically, Pride's biggest fans became the most conservative country fans, many of whom didn't care for the pop stylings Atkins had added.

Atkins's own biggest hit single came in [[1965]], with &quot;Yakety Axe,&quot; an adaptation of his friend saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]'s &quot;Yakety Sax.&quot;  He rarely performed in those days, and eventually had to hire other RCA producers like [[Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]] to allieviate his workload.  

In the [[1970s]], Atkins became increasingly stressed out by his executive duties.  He produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s pop hit &quot;And I Love You So.&quot; He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who'd become a hit artist in his own right.  A 1973 bout with [[colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he worked more on his music, often recording with Reed or even [[Homer &amp; Jethro]]'s Jethro Burns (Atkins's brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.  

By the end of the '70s, Atkins's time had passed as a producer. New executives at RCA had different ideas. He retired from his position in the company. Then began feeling stifled as an RCA artist because they would not let him branch out into [[jazz]]. At the same time he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch, no longer family-owned, was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. He left RCA in [[1982]] and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced an album in [[1983]]. While he was with Columbia, he showed his creativity and taste in jazz guitar, and in various other contexts. Jazz had always been a strong love of Atkins, and many times during his career he was criticized by &quot;pure&quot; country musicians for his jazz influences.  He also said - on many occasions - that he did not like being called a &quot;country guitarist&quot;, insisting that he was a guitarist, period.  Later in life, he learned to read music, and even performed some classical guitar pieces with taste and distinction.  He did return to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and Jerry Reed.  On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the 20th century, he named Django Rheinardt to the first position on the list, and modestly placed himself at fifth position.

Atkins received numerous awards, including eleven [[Grammy Award]]s and nine [[Country Music Association]] Instrumentalist of the Year awards. While he did more performing in the 1990s his health grew frail as the cancer returned and worsened.  He died on June 30, 2001 at his home in Nashville.

Before his health drastically declined, Atkins authored a book on his music and his extensive guitar collection for publisher Russ Cochran.  In his final recollection, he stated:

:Years from now, after I'm gone, someone will listen to what I've done and know I was here. They may not know or care who I was, but they'll hear my guitars speaking for me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''''' Cahiers du cinéma''''' is an influential [[France|French]] [[film]] [[magazine]] founded in [[1951]] by [[Andre Bazin|André Bazin]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Lo Duca]]. It was a development from the earlier magazine ''Revue du Cinéma'' and the members of two Paris film clubs &amp;mdash; ''Objectif 49'' ([[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]], etc.) and ''Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin''. Initially edited by [[Éric Rohmer]] (Maurice Scherer) it included amongst its writers [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[François Truffaut]].

The critical writing of ''Cahiers'' re-invented the basic tenets of [[film theory]] ([[auteur theory|auteurs]], [[mise en scène]], la critique des beautés etc.) and [[film theory|film scholarship]] &amp;mdash; establishing the 'value' of the [[Hollywood]] films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Howard Hawks]] then directors including [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Fritz Lang]], and [[Anthony Mann]], as well as [[Jean Renoir]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Max Ophuls]], and [[Jean Cocteau]]. While also attacking the existing French directors (La qualité française &amp;mdash; novelization, over-elaboration etc.). The magazine also created the ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]]'' or New Wave of French cinema, which was largely directed by ex-writers of the magazine. 

After being reactionary and isolated in the [[1950s]] the replacement of Rohmer by Jacques Rivette in [[1963]] meant that the magazine staff were more sensitive to political and social trends as well as responding more to non-Hollywood films. The style moved through literary modernism in the early [[1960s]] to radicalism and &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; by 1970 and through the mid-70s the magazine was run by a [[Maoist]] collective. A return to more commercial perspectives in the late [[1970s]], marked by a review of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and a more organised turnover of editors ([[Serge Daney]], [[Serge Toubiana]], [[Thierry Jousse]], [[Antoine de Baecque]], and [[Charles Tesson]]) meant the rehabilitation of some of the old Cahiers favourites as well as some new names like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Raul Ruiz|Raúl Ruíz]], [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]], [[Youssef Chahine]], and [[Maurice Pialat]]. More recent writers have included [[Serge Daney]], Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, Charles Tesson and [[Franck Nouchi]], [[Andre Techine]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Olivier Assayas]], [[Danièle Dubroux]], and [[Serge Le Peron]].

In [[1998]], the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing ''Cahiers'') was acquired by the press group ''[[Le Monde]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Circuit Park Zandvoort''' is a motor [[circuit (racing)|racing circuit]] located near the town of [[Zandvoort]], in the [[Netherlands]], near the [[North Sea]] coast line. 

Although there were some races at Zandvoort before [[World War II|WW II]], a real circuit was not built until after the war, mainly designed by [[John Hugenholz]]. 
The first event was held in [[1949]], as the Zandvoort Grand Prix. The following year, the race was called the Dutch Grand Prix, and it was included in the [[Formula One]] World Championship in [[1952]]. In [[1985]], the Dutch Grand Prix was held for the last time, as part of the circuit had to be remodelled because of new buildings. Currently the circuit is again bidding to be included in the Formula One World Championship. The major event that is currently held at the circuit is the [[Marlboro Masters]], where [[Formula 3]] cars of several national racing series compete with each other.

The most famous corner in the circuit is the ''Tarzanbocht'' (Tarzan corner) which provides excellent overtaking opportunities. This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of [[Tarzan]] and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track's designers named a nearby corner after him.

In the history of the circuit, several fatal accidents have occurred: among them those of [[Piers Courage]] during the [[1970]] Dutch Grand Prix, and [[Roger Williamson]] died in [[1973]].

The older 'Classic' Zandvoort circuit layout is modeled in detail and can be driven in the [[Grand Prix Legends]] racing simulation for X86-based pc's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Crete Senesi''' refers to an area of the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Tuscany]] to the south of [[Siena]]. It consists of a range of hills and woods among villages and includes  the ''[[comuni]]'' of 
[[Asciano]], 
[[Buonconvento]],
[[Monteroni d'Arbia]],
[[Rapolano Terme]] and
[[San Giovanni d'Asso]].

''Crete senesi'' are literally ‘clays of Siena’ and the distinctive gray colouration of the soil gives to the landscape an appearance often descibed as lunar.

Perhaps the most notable edifice of this area is the monastery [[Monte Oliveto Maggiore]].

Historically, '''corporatism''' or '''corporativism''' (Italian ''corporativismo'') is a [[political system]] in which legislative power is given to civic assemblies that represent economic, industrial, agrarian, and professional groups. Unlike [[pluralism]], in which many groups must compete for control of the state, in corporatism, certain unelected bodies take a critical role in the decision-making process. These corporatist assemblies are not the same as contemporary business [[corporations]] or incorporated groups.

The word &quot;corporatism&quot; is derived from the [[Latin]] word for body, ''corpus''. This original meaning was not connected with the specific notion of a [[business]] corporation, but rather a general reference to anything collected as a body. Its usage reflects medieval European concepts of a whole society in which the various components each play a part in the life of the society, just as the various parts of the body serve specific roles in the life of a body. According to various theorists, corporatism was an attempt to create a &quot;modern&quot; version of feudalism by merging the &quot;corporate&quot; interests with those of the state.  (Also see [[neofeudalism]].)

[[Political science|Political scientists]] may also use the term corporatism to describe a practice whereby an [[authoritarian]] [[state]], through the process of [[licensing]] and regulating officially-[[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] social, religious, economic, or popular organizations, effectively co-opts their leadership or circumscribes their ability to challenge state authority by establishing the state as the source of their [[legitimacy]]. This usage is particularly common in the area of [[East Asia]] studies, and is sometimes also referred to as ''state corporatism''.

In Italian Fascism, this non-elected form of state 'officializing' of every interest into the state was professed to better circumvent the marginalization of singular interests as would happen by the unilateral end condition inherent in the democractic voting process. Which would better instead recognize or 'incorporate' every divergent interest as it stands alone into the state &quot;organically&quot;, thus being the inspiration behind their use of the term [[Totalitarian]], perceivable to them as not meaning a coercive system but described distinctly as without coercion in the 1932 [[Doctrine of Fascism]] as thus;

''&quot;…(The state) is not simply a mechanism which limits the sphere of the supposed liberties of the individual…&quot;'' &amp; ''&quot;…Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State…&quot;'' but rather clearly connoting ''&quot;…Far from crushing the individual, the Fascist State multiplies his energies, just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers…&quot;''

This prospect in Italian Fascist Corporativism claimed to be the direct heir of [[Georges Sorel]]'s [[Anarcho-syndicalism]]. Wherein each interest was to form as its own entity with separate organizing parameters according to their own standards, only however within the corporative model of Italian Fascism each was supposed to be incorporated through the auspices &amp; organizing ability of a statist construct. This was by their reasoning the only possible way to achieve such a function, i.e. when resolved in the capability of an indissolvable state.

Contemporary popular usage of the term is more pejorative, especially when used as the shorter form ''corporatism'' (''corporativism'' usually implies only the Italian construct indicating public rather than private organizing), emphasizing the role of [[business]] corporations in government decision-making at the expense of the public. The power of business to affect government legislation through [[lobbying]] and other avenues of influence in order to promote their interests is usually seen as detrimental to those of the public. In this respect, corporatism may be characterized as an extreme form of [[regulatory capture]], and is also termed [[corporatocracy]].  If there is substantial military-corporate collaboration it is often called militarism or the [[military-industrial complex]]. 

Some contemporary political scientists and sociologists use the term ''neo-corporatism'' to describe a process of bargaining between labor, capital, and government identified as occurring in some small, open economies (particularly in [[Europe]]) as a means of distinguishing their observations from popular pejorative usage and to highlight ties to classical theories.

==Classical theoretical origins==
Corporatism is a form of [[class collaboration]] put forward as an alternative to [[class conflict]], and was first proposed in [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1891 [[encyclical]] [[Rerum Novarum]], which influenced [[Catholic trade unions]] that organised in the early twentieth century to counter the influence of trade unions founded on a [[socialist]] ideology. Theoretical underpinnings came from the [[medieval]] traditions of [[guild]]s and craft-based economics; and later, [[syndicalism]]. Corporatism was encouraged by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his 1931 encyclical [[Quadragesimo Anno]].

[[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Alceste de Ambris]] incorporated principles of corporative philosophy in their [[Constitution of Fiume]].

One early and important theorist of corporatism was [[Adam Müller]], an advisor to [[Prince Metternich]] in what is now eastern [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Müller propounded his views as an antidote to the twin &quot;dangers&quot; of the [[egalitarianism]] of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[laissez-faire]] economics of [[Adam Smith]]. In Germany and elsewhere there was a distinct aversion among rulers to allow unrestricted capitalism, owing to the [[feudalism|feudalist]] and [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] tradition of giving state privileges to the wealthy and powerful.

Under [[fascism]] in Italy, business owners, employees, trades-people, professionals, and other economic classes were organized into 22 guilds, or associations, known as &quot;corporations&quot; according to their industries, and these groups were given representation in a legislative body known as the ''Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni.'' For excerpts from Mussolini's essay discussing the corporatist state, see [[Doctrine of Fascism]].

Similar ideas were also ventilated in other European countries at the time. For instance, [[Austria]] under the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Dollfuß]] dictatorship had a constitution modelled on that of Italy; but there were also conservative philosophers and/or economists advocating the corporate state, for example [[Othmar Spann]]. In [[Portugal]], a similar ideal, but based on bottom-up individual moral renewal, inspired [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] to work towards corporatism. He wrote the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1933]], which is credited as the first [[corporatist]] constitution in the world.

==Neo-corporatism==
In the recent literature of [[political science]] and [[sociology]], corporatism (or neo-corporatism) lacks negative connotation. In the writings of Philippe Schmitter, Gerhard Lehmbruch and their followers, &quot;neo-corporatism&quot; refers to social arrangements dominated by tri-partite bargaining between [[labor unions|unions]], the private sector (capital), and government. Such bargaining is oriented toward (a) dividing the productivity gains created in the economy &quot;fairly&quot; among the social partners and (b) gaining wage restraint in recessionary or inflationary periods.

Most political economists believe that such neo-corporatist arrangements are only possible in societies in which labor is highly organized and various [[labor unions]] are hierarchically organized in a single labor federation. Such &quot;encompassing&quot; unions bargain on behalf of all workers, and have a strong incentive to balance the employment cost of high wages against the real income consequences of small wage gains. Many of the small, open European economies, such as [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]] fit this classification. In the work of some scholars, such as [[Peter J. Katzenstein]], neo-corporatist arrangements enable small open economies to effectively manage their relationship with the global economy. The adjustment to trade shocks occurs through a bargaining process in which the costs of adjustment are distributed evenly (&quot;fairly&quot;) among the social partners. 

Examples of modern neocorporatism include the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Conference or in the Economic and Social Committee of the [[European Union]], the collective agreement arrangements of the Scandinavian countries, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Poldermodel]] system of consensus, or the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s system of [[Social Partnership]]. In [[Australia]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] governments of [[1983]]-[[1996|96]] fostered a set of policies known as ''The Accord'', under which the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] agreed to hold back demands for [[wages|pay increases]], the compensation being increased expenditure on the &quot;[[social wage]]&quot;, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]]'s name for broad-based [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs. In [[Italy]], the [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] administration inaugurated in [[July 23]] [[1993]] a ''concertation'' ([[Italian Language|italian]]: ''concertazione'') policy of peaceful agreement on salary rates between [[government]], the three main [[trade unions]] and the [[Confindustria]] employers' federation. Before that, salary augmentations always were conquered by [[strike action|strike actions]]. In [[2001]] the [[Silvio Berlusconi]] administration put an end to concertation.

Most theorists agree that neo-corporatism is undergoing a crisis. In many classically corporatist countries, traditional bargaining is on the retreat. This crisis is often attributed to [[globalization]], but this claim is not undisputed.

==State corporatism==
While classical corporatism and its intellectual successor, neo-corporatism (and their [[Corporatism#Criticism|critics]]) emphasize the role of corporate bodies in influencing government decision-making, corporatism used in the context of the study of [[autocratic]] [[states]], particularly within [[East Asian studies]], usually refers instead to a process by which the state uses officially-recognized organizations as a tool for restricting public participation in the political process and limiting the power of [[civil society]].

Under such a system, as described by Jonathan Unger and Anita Chan in their essay ''China, Corporatism, and the [[East Asian Model]]''[http://www.usc.cuhk.edu.hk/wk_wzdetails.asp?id=1544],
&lt;blockquote&gt;at the national level the state recognizes one and only one organization (say, a national labour union, a business association, a farmers' association) as the sole representative of the sectoral interests of the individuals, enterprises or institutions that comprise that organization's assigned constituency. The state determines which organizations will be recognized as legitimate and forms an unequal partnership of sorts with such organizations. The associations sometimes even get channelled into the policy-making processes and often help implement state policy on the government's behalf.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By establishing itself as the arbitrator of legitimacy and assigning responsibility for a particular [[constituency]] with one sole organization, the state limits the number of players with which it must negotiate its policies and co-opts their leadership into policing their own members. This arrangement is not limited to economic organizations such as business groups or trade unions; examples can also include social or religious groups. Examples abound, but one such would be the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Islamic Association of China]], in which the state actively intervenes in the appointment of [[imams]] and controls the educational contents of their seminaries, which must be approved by the government to operate and which feature courses on &quot;patriotic reeducation&quot;.[http://hrw.org/wr2k2/asia4.html] Another example is the phenomenon known as &quot;Japan, Inc.&quot;, in which major industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] and their dependent workforces were consciously manipulated by the Japanese [[MITI]] to maximize post-war economic growth.

==Criticism of Corporatism==
'''Corporatism''' or '''neo-corporatism''' is often used popularly as a pejorative term in reference to perceived tendencies in politics for [[legislator]]s and [[Administration#Government|administrations]] to be influenced or dominated by the interests of business enterprises. The influence of other types of corporations, such as [[labor unions]], is perceived to be relatively minor. In this view, government decisions are seen as being influenced strongly by which sorts of policies will lead to greater profits for favored companies. 

Corporatism is also used to describe a condition of corporate-dominated [[globalization]].  Points enumerated by users of the term in this sense include the prevalence of very large, [[multinational corporation]]s that freely move operations around the world in response to corporate, rather than public, needs; the push by the corporate world to introduce legislation and treaties which would restrict the abilities of individual nations to restrict corporate activity; and similar measures to allow corporations to sue nations over &quot;restrictive&quot; policies, such as a nation's environmental regulations that would restrict corporate activities.

Critics of capitalism often argue that any form of capitalism would eventually devolve into corporatism, due to the [[Wealth condensation|concentration of wealth]] in fewer and fewer hands. A permutation of this term is '''corporate globalism'''. [[John Ralston Saul]] argues that most Western societies are best described as corporatist states, run by a small elite of professional and interest groups, that exclude political participation from the citizenry.

Many critics of free market theories, such as [[George Orwell]], have argued that corporatism (in the sense of an economic system dominated by massive corporations) is the natural result of free market capitalism.

Others critics say that they are pro-capitalist, but anti-corporatist. They support capitalism but only when corporate power is separated from state power.

===Corporatism and Fascism===
Some critics equate too much corporate power and influence with fascism. See [[Fascism and ideology]]. Often they cite a quote claimed to be from Mussolini: &quot;Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.&quot; However the most common cites for the quote do not track back to this phrase, and it is most likely an Internet hoax. [http://www.publiceye.org/fascist/corporatism.html]. Despite this, the alleged quote has entered into modern discourse, and it appears on thousands of web pages  [http://www.google.com/search?q=mussolini+fascism+corporatism+%22merger+of+state+and+corporate+power%22], and in books [http://books.google.com/books?q=mussolini+fascism+corporatism+%22merger+of+state+and+corporate+power%22], and even a conspiracy theory advertisement in the ''Washington Post.''[http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/051603_wash_post_ad.html]. However, the alleged quote contradicts almost everything else written by Mussolini on the subject of the relationship between corporations and the Fascist State.[http://www.publiceye.org/fascist/corporatism.html]. 

In one 1935 English translation of what Mussolini wrote, the term &quot;corporative state&quot; is used,[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm] but this has a different meaning from modern uses of the terms used to discuss business corporations. In that same translation, the phrase &quot;national Corporate State of Fascism,&quot; refers to syndicalist corporatism. The dubious quote is sometimes claimed to more accurately summarize what Mussolini did and not what he said. However many scholars of fascism reject this claim. See [[Fascism and ideology]]. 

There is a very old argument about who controlled who in the fascist states of Italy and Germany at various points in the timeline of power. It is agreed that the army, the wealthy, and the big corporations ended up with much more say in decision making than other elements of the corporative state [http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/corpor-st.html] [http://www.bartleby.com/65/fa/fascism.html] [http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Fascism.html]. There was a power struggle between the fascist parties/leaders and the army, wealthy, and big corporations. It waxed and waned as to who had more power at any given time. Scholars have used the term &quot;Mussolini's corporate state&quot; in many different ways[http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=mussolini+corporate+state]. 

In the United States, corporations representing many different sectors are involved in attempts to influence legislation through lobbying. This is also true of many non-business groups, unions, membership organizations, and non-profits. While these groups have no official membership in any legislative body, they can often wield considerable power over law-makers. In recent times, the profusion of lobby groups and the increase in campaign contributions has led to widespread controversy and the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold Act]].

===Free Market criticisms===
[[Free market]] theorists like [[Ludwig von Mises]], would describe corporatism as anathema to their vision of capitalism.  In the kind of capitalism such theorists advocate, what has been called the [[night-watchman state|&quot;night-watchman&quot; state]], the government's role in the economy is restricted to safeguarding the autonomous operation of the free market.  In this sense of capitalism, corporatism would be perceived as anti-capitalist as socialism.  Other critics argue that corporatist arrangements exclude some groups, notably the unemployed, and are thus responsible for high unemployment. This argument is the basis of the book &quot;Logic of Collective Action&quot; by Harvard economist [[Mancur Olson]].

In the United States, some claim that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]&amp;rsquo;s [[New Deal]] programs were an unprecedented jump towards a corporate state. Although there is a long history of narrow economic interests controlling the decision-making process in America, these critics, usually libertarians, say that the New Deal in general and the [[National Recovery Administration]] in particular represented a new and broad experiment in corporatism. [http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:fHF_o54pFCEJ:www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/1005RME] Several portions of the New Deal were struck down as [[unconstitutional]] by the US Supreme Court. For example, the Court in striking down the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] stated that &quot;a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, [is] a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government...&quot;Some [http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=3054] claim that later US governmental programs represent further state corporatist activity. In this context, corporatism has been described as ''economic fascism''. See: [[Fascism and ideology]].

[[Image:Juletræet.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Christmas tree in a Danish home.]]

A '''Christmas tree''' is one of the most popular [[tradition]]s associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]]. It is normally an [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] that is brought into a home or used in the open, and is decorated with [[Christmas lights]] and colourful [[Christmas ornament|ornament]]s during the days around Christmas.

==Dates==
Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] ([[24 December]]), and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|twelfth night]] (i.e., [[6 January]]); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck. Modern [[commercialisation]] of Christmas has however resulted in trees being put up much earlier; in [[shop]]s often as early as late October. The most common tradition in U.S. homes is to put the tree up right after [[Thanksgiving]] (the fourth Thursday in November) and to take it down right after the [[New Year]]. In more northern climates and into Canada, the tree (if not too dry) and other decorations are left up well into January. In Europe, private Christmas trees are not usually put up until at least the middle of December and are usually taken down by the 6th of January. In Germany, the Catholic people takes their Christmas trees down by the 2nd of February.

==Types of trees used==
[[Image:Christmas tree2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A sheared tree.]]
Both natural and artificial trees are used as Christmas trees.

===Natural trees===
The best [[species]] for use are species of [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the major benefit of not shedding the needles when they dry out, as well as good foliage colour and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used. Commonly used species in northern [[Europe]] (including the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) are:

*[[Silver Fir]] ''Abies alba'' (the original species)
*[[Nordmann Fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana'' (as in the photo)
*[[Noble Fir]] ''Abies procera''
*[[Norway Spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (generally the cheapest)
*[[Serbian Spruce]] ''Picea omorika'' 
*[[Scots Pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
and in [[North America]]:
*[[Balsam Fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
*[[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
*[[Noble Fir]] ''Abies procera''
*[[Red Fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
*[[Coast Douglas-fir|Douglas-fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
*[[Scots Pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
*[[Stone Pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Giant Sequoia]], [[Leyland Cypress]] and [[Eastern Juniper]]. [[Virginia Pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States, however it has poor winter colour and sharp needles. The long-needled [[Eastern White Pine]] is also used there. [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] is sometimes used, particularly in the [[Oceania]] region, and in [[Australia]] some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees.

Some trees are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]], to be planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. However, the combination of root loss on digging, and the indoor environment of high [[temperature]] and low [[humidity]] is very detrimental to the tree's health, and the survival rate of these trees is low. These trees must be kept inside only for a few days, as the warmth will bring them out of [[dormancy]], leaving them little protection when put back outside into the midwinter cold in most areas. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio.

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally-grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside much of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]&lt;!--need a source for this--&gt;) there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations. The shearing also damages the highly attractive natural [[symmetry]] of unsheared trees. In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s.

In the [[UK]], [[The British Christmas Tree Growers Association]] represents the interests of all those who grow Christmas trees in [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

===Artificial trees===
[[Image:TSTNewWorldCentre.jpg|thumb|250px|A huge artificial Christmas tree outside a shopping mall in [[Hong Kong]], [[China]]]]
Artificial trees are very popular, particularly in the U.S., where despite their lack of realism (both in looks and [[odor|scent]]), they are considered more convenient and (if used for several years) less expensive than real trees. Trees come in a number of colours and &quot;species&quot;, and some come pre-decorated with coloured lights. At the end of the Christmas season artificial trees can be diassembled and stored compactly, but some artificial-tree owners simply store the whole decorated tree covered in a large bag, ready for the next year. In the U.S., about 70% of trees are now artificial.

Artificial trees are sometimes even a necessity in some rented homes (especially [[apartment]] flats), due to the potential [[fire]] danger from a dried-out real tree, leading to their prohibition by some [[landlord]]s. They may also be necessary for people who have an [[allergy]] to conifers, and are increasingly popular in office settings.

====Feather trees====
The first artificial trees were tabletop ''feather trees'', made from green-[[dye]]d [[goose]] [[feather]]s wound onto sticks drilled into a larger one, like the branches on a tree. Originating in [[Germany]] in the 19th century to prevent further [[deforestation]], these &quot;[[minimalism|minimalist]]&quot; trees show off small ornaments very well. The first feather trees came to the U.S. in 1913, in the [[Sears Holdings Corporation|Sears, Roebuck and Company]] [[catalog]].

====Modern trees====
The first modern artificial Christmas trees were produced by companies which made [[brush]]es. They were made the same way, using animal hair (mainly [[pig]] bristles) and later [[plastic]] bristles, dyed pine-green colour, inserted between twisted wires that form the branches. The bases of the branches were then twisted together to form a large branch, which was then inserted by the user into a wooden pole (now metal with plastic rings) for a trunk. Each row of branches is a different size, colour coded at the base with paint or stickers for ease of assembly.

The first trees looked like long-needled pine trees, but later trees use flat [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] sheets to make the needles. Many also have very short brown &quot;needles&quot; wound in with the longer green ones, to imitate the branch itself or the bases that each group of pine (but not other conifer) needles grows from. These trees have become a little more realistic every year, with a few [[deluxe]] trees containing multiple branch styles. Many trees now come in &quot;slim&quot; versions, to fit in smaller spaces. Most of the better trees have branches hinged to the pole, though the less-expensive ones generally still come separately. Better trees also have more branch tips, the number usually listed on the box.

Around 2003, some trees with molded-plastic branches started selling in the U.S..

====Designer trees====
The first trees which were not green were the [[metallic]] trees of the 1950s and 1960s. They were [[aluminium]]-coated [[paper]], meaning that they also posed a great fire hazard if lights were put directly on them (warnings to this effect are still issued with most christmas tree lights). They were instead lit by a [[searchlight|spotlight]] or [[floodlight]], often with a [[motor]]ised rotating [[color wheel]] in front of it. More recent tinsel trees can be used fairly safely with lights.

Other artificial trees which look nothing like a conifer except for the triangular or conical shape, are also used as tabletop decorations, such as a stack of ornaments.

====Outdoor trees====
Outdoor branched trees made out of heavy white-[[enameled wire|enameled]] [[steel]] wires have become more popular on U.S. [[lawn]]s in the 2000s, along with 1990s [[spiral]] ones that hang from a central pole, both styles being lighted with standard miniature lights. These lights are usually white, but often are green, red, red/green, blue/white, blue, or multicoloured, and sometimes with a small controller to fade colours back and forth.  

A few [[hotel]]s and other buildings, both public and private, will string lights up from the roof to the top of a small tower on top of the building, so that at night it appears as a lit Christmas tree, often using green or other coloured lights. Some [[skyscraper]]s will tell certain offices to leave their lights on (and others off) at night during December, creating a Christmas tree pattern.

====Other gimmicks====
[[Image:Fiber-optic Christmas tree.jpg|thumb|A tree with fibre optic lights]]
Since the late 1990s, many indoor artificial trees come pre-strung with lights. Some are instead lit partly or completely by [[fibre optics]], with the light in the base, and a rotating colour wheel causing various colours to shimmer across the tree.

In 2005 inverted trees became popular. They were originally sold as decorations for merchants that allowed customers to get closer to ornaments being sold. Customers then wanted to replicate the inverted tree. Retailers also claimed that the trees were popular because they allowed larger presents to be placed beneath the trees.

Past gimmicks include small talking or singing trees, and trees which blow &quot;snow&quot; (actually small [[styrofoam]] beads) over themselves, collecting them in a decorative [[cardboard]] bin at the bottom and blowing them back up to the top through a tube hidden next to the trunk.

A long-standing and simple gimmick is conifer [[seed]]lings sold with cheap decorations attached by soft [[pipe cleaner]]s. Real potted ones are often sold like this, and artificial ones often come with a &quot;root ball&quot; but only sometimes with decorations.

====Environmental issues====
There is some debate as to whether artificial or real trees are better for the [[environment]]. Artificial trees are usually made out of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], a toxic material which is often stabilised with [[lead]]. Some trees have a warning that dust or leaves from the tree should not be eaten or inhaled. A small amount of real-tree material is used in some artificial trees. For instance, the [[bark]] of a real tree can be used to surface an artificial trunk. [[Polyethylene]] trees are less toxic, though more expensive, than PVC trees [http://www.grist.org/advice/ask/2004/12/08/umbra-tree/].

Artificial trees can be used for many years, but are usually non-recyclable, ending up in [[landfill]]s. Real trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and used as [[mulch]] or used to prevent [[erosion]] [http://doityourself.com/holiday/realorartificial.htm]. Real trees also help reduce the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]] while growing. 

Live trees are typically grown as a [[crop]] and replanted in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable [[habitat]] for wildlife. In some cases management of Christmas tree crops can result in poor habitat since it involves heavy input of [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s. [[Organic farming|Organically grown]] Christmas trees are available in some markets, and as with many other crops, are widely held to be better for the environment.

==Decoration and ornaments==
[[Tinsel]] and several types of [[garland (decoration)|garland]] or [[ribbon]] are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Delicate mould-blown and painted coloured glass [[Christmas ornament]]s were a specialty of [[Czech lands|Czech]] glass factories from the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Lighting with [[candle]]s or electric lights ([[fairy lights]]) is commonly done, and a [[tree topper]] completes the ensemble.  Strands of [[tinsel]] may be hung in groups from longer branches to simulate [[icicle]]s, though this [[trend]] has gradually fallen off since the late 1970s. Baubles are another extremely common decoration, and usually consist of a fairly small hollow glass or plastic sphere coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, and then with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide colouration.

Individuals' decorations vary wildly, typically being an eclectic mix of family traditions and personal tastes; even a small unattractive ornament, if passed down from a parent or grandparent, may come to carry considerable emotional value and be given pride of place on the tree. Conversely, trees decorated by professional designers for [[department store]]s and other institutions will usually have a &quot;theme&quot;; a set of predominant colours, multiple instances of each type of ornament, and larger decorations that may be more complicated to set up correctly.

Many people also decorate outdoor trees with food that [[bird]]s and other [[wildlife]] will enjoy, such as garlands made from unsalted [[popcorn]] or [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]] halves, and seed-covered [[suet]] cakes.

===Tree mats and skirts===
Since [[candle]]s were used to light trees until electric bulbs came about, a [[mat]] (UK) or &quot;[[skirt]]&quot; (US) was often placed on the floor below the tree to protect it by catching the dripping candle [[wax]], and also to collect any needles that fall. Even when dripless candles, electric lights and artificial trees have been used, a skirt is still usually used as a decorative feature: among other things, it hides the tree [[stand]], which may be unsightly but which is an important [http://www.safety.com/articles/keeping-your-christmas-tree-safe.html safety feature] of home trees. What began as ordinary [[cloth]] has now often become much more ornate, some having [[embroidery]] or being put together like a [[quilt]].  

A [[nativity scene]], [[model train]], or [[Christmas village]] may be placed on the mat or skirt. As Christmas presents arrive, they are generally placed underneath the tree on the tree skirt (depending on tradition, all Christmas gifts, or those too large to be hung on the tree, as in &quot;presents on the tree&quot; of the song &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot;).   

Generally, the difference between a mat and skirt is simply that a mat is placed ''under'' the tree stand, while a skirt is placed ''over'' it, having a hole in the middle for the trunk, with a slot cut to the outside edge so that it can be placed around the tree (beneath the branches) easily.  A plain mat of fabric or plastic may also be placed under the stand and skirt to protect the floor from scratches or water.

===Flocking===
In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]] to simulate snow.  Typically it would be sprayed all over the tree from the sides, which produced a look different from real snow, which settles in clumps atop branches.  Flocking can be done with a professional sprayer at a tree lot (or the manufacturer if it is artificial), or at home from a spray can, and either can be rather messy.  This tradition seems to be limited mostly to the United States.

==Care and disposal of natural trees==
These tips will ensure the tree will stay fresh for several weeks.
# When transporting the tree, protect it from wind and road salts by covering it with plastic.
# If decoration is not planned immediately, store the tree in a cool environment protected from the sun and wind. If possible, the night before decorating, bring the tree into a partially heated area to allow it to adjust gradually to temperature changes.
# Before taking your tree inside, gently bang the tree on its stump several times to dislodge any loose needles. Just before placing it in the stand, cut 2-3 centimeters off the trunk. This allows the tree to continue taking up water, by removing the [[resin]]-soaked wood at the original cut.
# Make sure your tree has a sturdy Christmas tree stand that holds 4-6 litres of water. Check it daily. Only use plain water; research shows that additives such as sugar, cola and aspirin do more harm than good.
# Place your tree away from heat sources, including radiators and windows that get a lot of direct sunlight.

After the holidays, dead trees can be put to other uses:
* Use your tree as a [[bird feeder]], hanging [[suet]] balls or other food from the branches.
* Use needles in a [[sachet]].
* Use the tree as a [[bean]] or [[pea]] support pole.
* Trees can be cut into small pieces and use for [[mulch]] or [[compost]]ed; some cities offer this service to their residents.
* In [[coast]]al areas, trees can be used to protect [[sand dune]]s from erosion.

==History==

[[Image:Dionysus.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dionysus]] in his Triumphant Return; behind the god, [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] holds an evergreen.]]

The Christmas tree is often explained as a [[Christianization]] of the ancient [[Paganism|pagan]] idea that the [[evergreen]] tree represents a celebration of the renewal of life. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s from what is today [[Tunisia]], showing the mythic triumphant return from [[India]] of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god of [[wine]] and male [[fertility]], [[Dionysus]] (dubbed by some modern scholars as a [[life-death-rebirth deity]]), the god carries a tapering coniferous tree. [[Medieval]] legends, nevertheless, tended to concentrate more on the miraculous &quot;flowering&quot; of trees at Christmas time. A branch of flowering [[Glastonbury thorn]] is still sent annually for the Queen's Christmas table in the [[United Kingdom]].

[[Image:taiwan_christmas_tree_bunun.jpg|right|thumb|[[Taiwanese_aborigine|Taiwanese aboriginals]], tutored by Christian missionaries, celebrate with trees ([[Cunninghamia|''Cunninghamia lanceolata'']]) outside their homes.]]

Patron trees (for example, the [[Irminsul]], [[Thor's Oak]] and the figurative [[Yggdrasil]]) held special significance for the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], appearing throughout historic accounts as sacred symbols and objects. Among early Germanic tribes the [[Yule]] tradition was celebrated by sacrificing male animals and [[slavery|slaves]] by suspending them on the branches of trees. According to [[Adam of Bremen]], in [[Scandinavia]] the pagan kings sacrificed nine males of each species at the [[Sacred grove|sacred groves]] every ninth year. According to one legend, [[Saint Boniface]] attempted to introduce the idea of [[trinity]] to the pagan tribes using the cone-shaped evergreen trees because of their triangular appearance.

The modern custom, however, although likely related, cannot be proven to be directly descended from pagan tradition. It can be traced to 16th century [[Germany]]; [[Ingeborg Weber-Keller]] ([[Marburg]] professor of European [[ethnology]]) identified as the earliest reference a [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] [[guild]] [[chronicle]] of 1570 which reports how a small fir was decorated with apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers, and erected in the guild-house, for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas day. Another early reference is from [[Basel]], where the taylor apprentices carried around town a tree decorated with apples and cheese in 1597. The city of [[Riga, Latvia]] claims to be home of the first holiday tree, an octagonal plaque in the town square reads &quot;The First New Years Tree in Riga in 1510&quot;, in eight different languages. During the 17th century, the custom entered family homes. One [[Strasbourg]] priest, Johann Konrad Dannerhauer, complains about the custom as distracting from the word of God. By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles are attested from the late 18th century. The Christmas tree remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long time. It was regarded as a Protestant custom by the Catholic majority along the lower Rhine, and was spread there only by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who were moved there in the wake of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Princess [[Henrietta von Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchess of Orleans. 

[[Image:Godey'streeDec1850.GIF|thumb|left|200px|The Queen's Christmas tree at [[Osborne House]]. The engraving republished in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'', Philadelphia, December 1850]]

In Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced by King George III's German Queen [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], but did not spread much beyond the royal family.  Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with the custom, in her journal for Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old Princess wrote: &quot;After dinner...we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room...There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees...&quot;.  After her marriage to her German cousin, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], the custom became even more widespread. In 1847, Prince Albert wrote: &quot;I must now seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the Christmas-trees is not less than ours used to be&quot;. The generous Prince Albert also presented large numbers of trees to schools and army barracks at Christmas. Images of the royal family with their Christmas tree at [[Osborne House]] were illustrated in English magazines, initially as a [[woodcut]] in the [[Illustrated London News]] of December 1848, and copied in the [[United States]] at Christmas 1850 (''illustration, left''). Such patriotic prints of the British royal family at Christmas celebrations helped popularise the Christmas tree in Britain and among the anglophile American upper class.

There are several cities in the United States which lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree. [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]] claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House, thus making it the home of the first Christmas tree in New England. The &quot;First Christmas Tree in America&quot; is also claimed by [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816.

Many [[cities]], [[town]]s, and [[department store]]s put up public Christmas trees outdoors for everyone to enjoy, such as the [[Rich's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in [[New York City]] and the large Christmas tree  at [[Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]]. In some cities [[Festival of Trees|festivals]] are organised around the decoration and display of multiple trees as charity events. In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in [[Trafalgar Square]] in  [[London]] where the City of Oslo presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in [[Boston]] where the tree is a gift from the city of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia (former city)|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] that leveled Halifax harbor; and in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where the 15 [[metre|m]] tall main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], [[Norway]] in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from [[Nazi]] occupation.

[[Image:National-christmas-tree-2004.jpg|thumb|National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C.]]
The [[United States]]' [[National Christmas Tree]] is lit each year south of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Today, the lighting of the National Tree is part of what has become a major holiday event at the White House. President [[Jimmy Carter]] only lit the crowning star atop the Tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans being [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage in Iran]]; in 1980, the tree was only fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.

The term ''[[Charlie Brown]] Christmas tree'' can be used to described any sad-looking, malformed little tree. Some tree buyers intentionally adopt such trees, feeling sympathetic to their plights. The term comes from the appearance of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree in the [[:Category:Christmas television specials|TV special]] ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.

===Name controversy===
The term '''holiday tree''' has, since at least 1990 (and perhaps before), been used by some in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[UK]] to reflect the winter [[holiday season]] instead of any specific religious holiday. A recent campaign spearheaded by conservative [[Fox News Channel]] contributors [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Sean Hannity]] has resulted in a backlash from some Christian groups and individuals who feel the designation &quot;holiday tree&quot; is part of the [[war on Christmas]].

===Usage controversy===
Some Christians, albeit a minority, feel that the practice of having &quot;Christmas Trees&quot; is prohibited by the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 10:1-5 which says,

:For the customs of the people [are] vain: for [one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. [[KJV]].

Interpreting those verses as a ban on Christmas trees may be more common among individuals and [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]] that are part of the [[King-James-Only Movement]].

In other [[English translations of the Bible]] the verses more explicitly refer to the practice of making idols to be worshipped:

:For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a ''craftsman shapes it with his chisel''. They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with a hammer and nails so it will not totter. Like a scarecrow in a melon patch, their idols cannot speak; ''they must be carried because they cannot walk''. ''Do not fear them''; they can do no harm nor can they do any good. (emphasis added) [[NIV]]

A full study of the passage shows that the people would cut down a tree and work it with a chisel to engrave an image in it.  They would also carry it from place to place as an object to be feared and worshipped. The only consistencies with Christmas tree customs seem to be that both are made of wood and both are decorated.

Some Christians, again a minority, feel that since &quot;Christmas Trees&quot; are not biblically ordained, they should not be used.  Such individuals and [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]] are unlikely to celebrate [[Christmas]] at all, for the same reason, such as the [[United Church of God]].

Some churches use the same stripped Christmas tree as a [[Christian cross]] at [[Easter]]. This is comparable to the [[Old English]] poem [[The Dream of the Rood]].

The '''carrier battle group''' ('''CVBG or CARBATGRU''') or '''carrier strike group''' ('''CVSG''') is a fleet of ships in support of an [[aircraft carrier]]. Such groups are primarily used by the [[United States Navy]], which has 12 carrier battle groups scattered across the world. Their existence is an important part of the [[power projection]] capability of the [[United States]] in that they provide the ability to strike quickly almost anywhere in the world.

The large number of CVBGs used by the United States reflects, in part, a division of labor allotted during the [[Cold War]], in which the United States assumed primary responsibility for [[blue water]] operations and for safeguarding supply lines between the United States and [[Europe]], while the [[NATO]] allies assumed responsibility for [[maritime geography|brown and green water]] operations.

==Design==
The need for a battle group is due to the fact that while the aircraft carrier has the ability to project a large amount of air power, it is vulnerable to attack from other surface ships and submarines. One way of looking at the CVBG is that the carrier performs the mission assigned to it while the primary role of the other ships is in protection of the carrier.

CVBGs have no definitive specification and are formed and dissolved on an ad-hoc basis, and one may be different from another. However, they all comprise similar types of ships, and a typical U.S. carrier battle group might include:
* a carrier, usually [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'']]-class &amp;mdash; The carrier provides a wide range of options to the U.S. government, ranging from simply showing the flag, to attacks on airborne, afloat and ashore targets. Because carriers operate in [[international waters]], their aircraft do not need to secure landing rights on foreign soil. These ships also engage in sustained operations in support of other forces. The carrier is the flagship of the battle group, with the commanding [[rear admiral]] on board, making use of the advanced combat information center and communications suite.
* two [[guided missile cruiser]]s, usually [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga'']] class &amp;mdash; multi-mission surface combatants, equipped with [[Tomahawk missile]]s for long-range strike capability.
* two to three [[guided missile destroyer]]s, usually [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'']]-class &amp;mdash; multi-mission surface combatant, used primarily for anti-air warfare (AAW) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW)
* a [[frigate]], usually [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'']]-class &amp;mdash; primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW)
* two attack [[submarine]]s, usually [[Los Angeles class submarine|'' Los Angeles'']]-class &amp;mdash; in a direct support role seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines
* a combined ammunition, [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]], and [[supply ship]], usually [[fast combat support ship|''Sacramento'']] or ''Supply'' class &amp;mdash; provides logistic support enabling the Navy's forward presence: on station, ready to respond

The Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) could be employed in a variety of roles, most of which would involve the gaining and maintenance of sea control:
* Protection of economic and/or military shipping.
* Protection of a [[USMC|Marine]] amphibious force while en route to, and upon arrival in, an amphibious objective area.
* Establishing [[air superiority]] or [[Air supremacy|supremacy]] in an area in combination with land-based aircraft.
* Establishing a naval presence in support of national interests.

==History==
The CVBG was first used in [[World War II]], primarily in conflicts between the United States and [[Japan]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. CVBGs at the time consisted of a far larger number of ships than current CVBGs, and this marked the only time CVBGs have fought each other, notably at the [[Battle of Midway]].

During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of duelling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. The main scenario of interest would have been an attack against a CVBG using large number of anti-ship [[cruise missile]]s. The attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the [[Falklands War]].

In the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|21st]] centuries, most of the uses of CVBGs by the United States have been in situations in which their use has been uncontested. The main scenario involving carriers coming under fire which is of interest to naval strategists has been a conflict between the United States and the [[People's Republic of China]] over [[Taiwan]]. There is a consensus among observers that most of the military effort expended by the [[People's Liberation Army]] since the 1990s has been to at least complicate the deployment of a CVBG in a [[Taiwan straits conflict]].

==Debate on Future Viability==
There is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched fire power and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] flight and the ability to do radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that that CVBGs were designed for [[Cold War]] scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore.

The '''CH-46D Sea Knight''' [[helicopter]] is a medium lift assault helicopter, used by the [[United States Navy]] for shipboard delivery of cargo, personnel, and search &amp; rescue. The '''CH-46E''' is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment. Assault Support is its primary function, and the movement of supplies and equipment is secondary. Additional tasks may be assigned, such as combat support, search and rescue, support for forward refueling and rearming points, aeromedic evacuation of casualties from the field, and recovery of [[aircraft]] and personnel.

The CH-46 Sea Knight was first procured in [[1960]] under the old designation of '''HRB-1''' to meet the medium-lift requirements of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in all combat and peacetime environments since that time. The final production version was the CH-46F. In all, 524 H-46s were produced for the Navy and Marine Corps. The last Sea Knight rolled off the assembly line in February of 1971.  The fleet is currently being maintained until a suitable replacement is approved.

On [[September 24]], [[2004]] the USN retired the type, seeing it replaced by the [[SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Knighthawk]]. The USMC is replacing its CH-46's with the [[V-22 Osprey]]. The first V-22 squadron, HMM-263, will be stood up in March of 2006 and renamed VMM-263.  The replacement process is expected to continue through the other medium helicopter squadrons, into 2014.

The '''Chief of Naval Operations''' ('''CNO''') is the senior military officer in the [[United States Navy]]. The CNO is an [[admiral]] (four-star) and is responsible to the [[Secretary of the Navy]] for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the Secretary. The CNO has administrative, rather than operational command authority over United States naval forces. The operational [[chain of command]] runs from the [[Secretary of Defense]] directly to the [[combatant commanders]], who have command authority over all military forces in their region.  This structure, in which the service chiefs are responsible for personnel and readiness issues, while the combatant commanders are operationally responsible for the command of the military forces, is intended to allow the United States military the ability to function as a coherent whole.

A member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the CNO is the principal naval advisor to the [[President of the United States]], the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Navy on the conduct of war, and is the principal advisor and naval executive to the Secretary on the conduct of naval activities of the [[United States Department of the Navy]]. Assistants are the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]] (VCNO), the [[Deputy Chiefs of Naval Operations]] (DCNOs) and a number of other ranking officers. These officers and their staffs are collectively known as the [[Office of the Chief of Naval Operations]] (OpNav).

'''Clara Petacci''' ('''Claretta Petacci''') ([[February 28]], [[1912]] &amp;ndash; [[April 28]], [[1945]]) was a young [[Rome|Roman]] girl from an upper-class family who became [[Benito Mussolini]]'s mistress. She was twenty-nine years his junior.

During Mussolini's capture by partisans in April [[1945]] it is said that Petacci was offered the opportunity to escape, but she firmly refused and instead tried to protect Mussolini with her body. The Duce was then shot immediately after her. On the following day, [[April 29]], [[1945]], at the Piazzale Loreto in [[Milan]], Mussolini and Petacci's bodies, along with four others, were hanged upside down at an Esso gas station and photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.

Petacci is apparently respectfully considered in Italy; without reference to politics, but only as a woman in love who did not abandon him in times of trouble.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Costa Smeralda''' (&quot;Emerald Coast&quot;) is a [[coast]]al area in northern [[Sardinia]], 55 km long and covering more than 30&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;, with enchanting [[beach]]es and a system of villages built according to an extremely detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]]. The area is a luxurious exclusive [[tourism|tourist]] destination, with high affluence of European and Arabian VIPs from the entertainment, politics and industry.  

The main towns and villages in the area are [[Arzachena]], [[Olbia]], [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]] and [[Romazzino]].

Annually in [[September]] the ''Sardinia Cup'' [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast, usually featuring famous boats.

[[archaeology|Achaeological]] sites include Li Muri, Nuragici People's &quot;Tomba dei Giganti&quot; (Giants' Tomb).

The development of the area started in [[1961]], and was financed by a consortium of companies. The president of the consortium and representative figure was Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Famous [[architect]]s involved in the project included Busiri-Vici and Vietti.

'''Chianti''' is [[Italy]]'s most famous red [[wine]]. It used to be easily identified by its squat [[bottle]] enclosed in a straw basket, called ''[[fiasco]]'' (&quot;flask&quot;).

It is produced in [[Tuscany]], in strictly delimited areas among the provinces of [[Province of Florence|Florence]], [[Province of Siena|Siena]], [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] and [[Province of Grosseto|Grosseto]].  It is based mainly on [[Sangiovese]] grapes but also includes other [[List of grape varieties|varieties]]. Chianti is a [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]], but corresponds to a much larger area than the region originally known as Chianti. Wine from this smaller region is labeled Chianti Classico and is a [[DOCG]]. It typically has a picture of a black rooster (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the [[bottle]]. Chianti Classico that meets slightly more stringent requirements, primarily with respect to aging, may be labelled Chianti Classico Riserva.

Chianti is not the only traditional wine made in Tuscany, and there are also new wines, usually based on sangiovese and some popular french grape that are usually dubbed &quot;[[Super Tuscan|Super Tuscans]]&quot;.

The word &quot;Chianti&quot; is used rather more loosely in the United States, to the chagrin of European wine-makers.

== Chianti Classico region ==

The region consists of five main communities

*Greve in Chianti
**Montefioralle
**Convertoie
**Montegonzi
**Canonica
**Castello di Uzzano
**Castello di Verrazano
*Radda in Chianti
**Volpaia
*Castellina in Chianti
*San Casciano Val di Pesa
**Mercatale Val di Pesa
**Faltignano
**Campoli
*Gaiole in Chianti
**Castello di Brolio

==Trivia==
The wine had a famous mention in a popular film ''[[Silence of the Lambs]]'' in the [[catchphrase]] &quot;I ate his liver with some [[fava bean]]s and a nice Chianti.&quot;

[[Image:Low pressure system over Iceland.jpg|thumb|right|This [[low pressure system]] over Iceland spins counter-clockwise due to the Coriolis effect.]]

The '''Coriolis effect''' is an apparent deflection of a moving object in a [[rotating frame of reference]]. There are examples of this effect in everyday life, such as the direction of [[Cyclone#Structure|rotation of cyclones]]. Due to the effect, cyclones rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. However, contrary to popular opinion, it has no noticeable effect on the rotation of water in sinks and [[toilets]] - see the [[#Draining_bathtubs/toilets|toilets/bathtubs section]] below.
The effect is named after [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]], a French scientist, who described it in 1835, though the mathematics appeared in the tidal equations of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] in 1778.

== Formula ==

The formula for the Coriolis acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=-2\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where (here and below) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle in the rotating system, and '''&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega&lt;/math&gt;''' is the angular velocity vector (which has magnitude equal to the rotation rate and points in the direction of the axis of rotation) of the rotating system. The equation may be multiplied by the mass of the relevant object to produce the Coriolis force. See [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation.

Note that this is [[cross product|vector multiplication]].  In non-vector terms: at a given rate of rotation of the observer, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration of the object will be proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the direction of movement of the object and the axis of rotation.

The ''Coriolis effect'' is the behavior added by the ''Coriolis acceleration''. The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the  rotation axis. So in particular:
* if the velocity (as always, in the rotating system) is zero, the Coriolis acceleration is zero
* if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero
* if the velocity is straight (perpendicularly) inward to the axis, the acceleration will follow the direction of rotation
* if the velocity is following the rotation, the acceleration will be (perpendicularly) outward from the axis 

In the formula above, the vectors are 3-d. If we are considering the simpler case of motion restricted to the surface of a rotating turntable the equation simplifies somewhat to:

: &lt;math&gt;-2\omega \boldsymbol k\times (u,v)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''k''' is a unit local vertical and &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity 2-d vector in the plane of the turntable. &lt;math&gt;-2\omega \boldsymbol k\times (u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to '''v''', and the equation may be re-written:

:  &lt;math&gt;-2\omega (u,-v)&lt;/math&gt;

When considering atmospheric dynamics, the Coriolis acceleration (strictly a 3-d vector in the first formula above) appears only in the horizontal equations, due to the neglect of products of small quantities and other approximations. The term that appears is then

: &lt;math&gt;- f \mathbf{k} \times (u,v)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''k''' is a unit local vertical, &lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin(\mbox{latitude})&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Coriolis parameter'' and &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; are the horizontal components of the velocity.

===What the Coriolis force is not===
* The Coriolis force does not depend on the curvature of the Earth, simply its rotation.  However, the strength of the Coriolis force varies with latitude, and that ''is'' due to the Earth being a sphere.
* Coriolis force is not the [[fictitious force|fictitious]] [[Centrifugal force]] given by &lt;math&gt;\omega\times(\omega\times\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the co-existence of Coriolis and centrifugal forces makes simple explanations of the effect of Coriolis in isolation difficult.

== Visualisation of the Coriolis effect ==

[[Image:DSCN8987 orangeparabola e.jpg|frame|right|A fluid assuming a parabolic shape as it is rotating]]

To demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a parabolic [[turntable]] can be used. On a flat turntable the centrifugal force, which always acts outwards from the rotation axis, would lead to objects being forced out off the edge. But if the surface of the turntable has the correct parabolic bowl shape, and is rotated at the correct rate, then the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface will exactly balance the centrifugal force. This allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.

Discs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from a rotating point of view, a video-camera is attached to the turntable in such a way that the camera is co-rotating with the turntable.

When the fluid is rotating on a flat turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape.  This fact may be exploited in order to make a parabolic turntable, by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]].

== Coriolis in Meteorology ==
Perhaps the most important instance of the  Coriolis effect is in the large scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere.  In meteorology, Coriolis effects tend to dominate centrifugal effects, because the latter is usually balanced by an ambient pressure gradient (exactly analogously to the slope on a parabolic turntable).

=== Flow around a low-pressure area ===

[[image:Coriolis_effect10.png|frame|right|Schematic representation of flow around a low-pressure area in the Northern hemisphere. The pressure gradient force is represented by blue arrows, the Coriolis acceleration (always perpendicular to the velocity) by red arrows]]

If a low pressure area forms in the atmosphere, air will tend to flow in towards it, but will be deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis acceleration. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. 

The force balance is largely between the [[pressure gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis acceleration acting away from the center of the low pressure. Instead of flowing down the gradient, the air tends to flow perpendicular to the air-pressure gradient and forms a cyclonic flow. This is an example of a more general case of [[geostrophic flow]] in which air flows along [[isobar]]s. On a non-rotating planet the air would flow along the straightest possible line, quickly leveling the air pressure. Note that the force balance is thus very different from the case of &quot;inertial circles&quot; (see below) which explains why mid-latitude cycles are larger by an order of magnitude than inertial circle flow would be.

This pattern of deflection, and the direction of movement, is called [[Buys-Ballot's law]]. The pattern of flow is called a [[cyclone]]. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is counterclockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there. Cyclones cannot form on the equator, and they rarely travel towards the equator, because in the equatorial region the coriolis parameter is small, and exactly zero on the equator.

=== Inertial circles ===

[[Image:Coriolis_effect14.png|frame|right|Schematic representation. Inertial circles of air masses in the absence of other forces, calculated for a wind speed of approximately 50 to 70 m/s.]]

An air or water mass subject moving with speed ''v'' subject only to Coriolis, the force bends the path and constrains the particle to travel in a circular trajectory called an 'inertial circle'.  Since the force is directed at right angles to the motion of the particle, it will move with a constant speed,  and perform a complete circle with frequency ''f''.  The magnitude of the Coriolis force also determines the radius of this circle:
: &lt;math&gt;v/f\,&lt;/math&gt;.

On the Earth, a typical mid-latitude value for ''f'' is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;; hence for a typical atmospheric speed of 10 m/s the radius is 100 km, with a period of about 14 hours.   In the ocean, where a typical speed is closer to 10cm/s, the radius of an inertial circle is 1km.  These inertial circles are clockwise in the northern hemisphere (where trajectories are bent to the right) and anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.

If the rotating system is a parabolic turntable, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant and the trajectories are exact circles.  On a rotating planet, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies with latitude and the paths of particles do not form exact circles.  Since the parameter ''f'' varies as &lt;math&gt;\sin(latitude)&lt;/math&gt;, the oscillations are smallest at the poles (latitude = &lt;math&gt;\pm 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;),  and would increase indefinitely at the equator, except the dynamics ceases to apply close to the equator. 

The dynamics of inertial circles are essentially different to mid-latitude [[cyclone]]s.  In the latter case, the Coriolis force (directed out) is in an approximate balance with the  [[pressure gradient force]] (directed inwards), a situation known as [[geostrophic balance]].  In particular, cyclones rotate in the opposite direction to inertial circles.

=== Draining bathtubs/toilets ===
A popular misconception is that the Coriolis effect determines the direction in which bathtubs or toilets drain, and whether water always drains in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the other direction in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect is a few orders of magnitude smaller than other random influences on drain direction, such as the geometry of the sink, toilet, or tub; whether it is flat or tilted; and the direction in which water was initially added to it.  If one takes great care to create a flat circular pool of water with a small, smooth drain; to wait for eddies caused by filling it to die down; and to remove the drain from below (or otherwise remove it without introducing new eddies into the water) &amp;ndash; then it is possible to observe the influence of the Coriolis effect in the direction of the resulting vortex.  There is a good deal of misunderstanding on this point, as most people (including many scientists) do not realize how small the Coriolis effect is on small systems.{{fn|1}}  This is less of a puzzle once one remembers that the earth revolves once per day but that a bathtub takes only minutes to drain. When the water is being drawn towards the plughole, the radius with which it is spinning around it decreases, so its rate of rotation increases from the low background level to a noticeable spin in order to [[Conservation_of_angular_momentum|conserve its angular momentum]] (the same effect as bringing one's arms in on a swivel chair making it spin faster).

=== Length scales and  the [[Rossby number|Rossby Number]] ===
The time, space and velocity scales are important in determining the importance of the Coriolis effect.  Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its [[Rossby number]], which is the ratio of the velocity of a system to the product of the Coriolis parameter, and the lengthscale of the motion:
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{U}{fL}&lt;/math&gt;.  
A small Rossby number signifies a system which is strongly affected by rotation, and a large Rossby number signifies a system in which rotation is unimportant.
An atmospheric system moving at ''U = 10''m/s occupying a spatial distance of ''L=1000''km, has a Rossby number 
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{10}{10^{-4}\times 1000\times10^3} = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;
A man playing catch may throw the ball at ''U=30''m/s in a garden of length ''L=50''m.  The Rossby number in this case would be
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{30}{10^{-4}\times 50} = 6000&lt;/math&gt;.
Needless to say, one does not worry about which hemisphere one is in when playing catch in the garden. However, an unguided missile obeys exactly the same physics as a baseball, but may travel far enough and be in the air long enough to notice the effect of Coriolis.  Long range shells landed close to, but to the right of where they were aimed until this was noted (or left if they were fired in the southern hemisphere, though most were not). 

The Rossby number can also tell us about the bathtub. If the lengthscale of the tub is about  ''L=1''m, and the water moves towards the drain at about ''60''cm/s, then the Rossby number is
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{0.6}{10^{-4}\times 1} = 6 000&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the bathtub is, in terms of scales, much like a game of catch, and rotation is likely to be unimportant. 

However, if the experiment is very carefully controlled to remove all other forces from the system, rotation can play a role in bathtub dynamics. An article in the British &quot;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&quot; in the 1930's describes this. The key is to put a few drops of ink into the bathtub water, and observing when the ink stops swirling, meaning the viscosity of the water has dissipated its initial vorticity (or curl; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times U = 0&lt;/math&gt;) then, if the plug is extracted ever so slowly so as not to introduce any additional vorticity, then the tub will empty with a counterclockwise swirl in England.

=== Terrestrial effects summarized ===

A summary of Coriolis effects on the Earth's surface. Note that some of these assume that we are considering a &quot;2-d&quot; velocity, in the plane tangential to the planets surface (if this restriction is removed, the latitude dependence of the strength of the Coriolis effect disappears).

* the magnitude of the Coriolis effect changes with the latitude and the speed of the air.
* the Coriolis effect is greatest in polar regions where the surface of the Earth is at right angles to the axis of rotation.
* the Coriolis effect decreases nearer the equator because the surface of the Earth is parallel to the axis of rotation.
* the Coriolis effect causes air masses to turn right in the northern hemisphere and causes air masses to turn left in the southern hemisphere.
* the Coriolis effect gives rise to geostrophic winds.
* a geostropic wind is a wind that occurs when the pressure exerted on the air by the pressure gradient is equal to the opposing Coriolis effect force.
*the effect works in opposite directions in the two hemispheres - an object travelling across the equator, and moving equal distances each side, would find its course deflected in a parabolic arc that would begin and end on the same line of longitude.

The Coriolis effect strongly affects the large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]], leading to the [[Hadley Cell | Hadley]], [[Ferrel cell| Ferrel]], and Polar cells. In the oceans, Coriolis is responsible for the propagation of [[Kelvin wave]]s and the establishment of the [[Sverdrup balance]].

== Coriolis Elsewhere ==

=== Coriolis flow meter ===
A practical application of the Coriolis effect is the [[mass flow meter]], an instrument that measures the [[mass flow rate]] of a fluid through a tube. The operating principle was introduced in 1977 by Micro Motion Inc. Simple flow meters measure [[volumetric flow rate|volume flow rate]], which is proportional to mass flow rate only when the [[density]] of the fluid is constant. If the fluid has varying density, or contains bubbles, then the volume flow rate multiplied by the density is not an accurate measure of the mass flow rate. The  Coriolis mass flow meter operating principle essentially involves rotation, though not through a full circle. It works by inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes, and subsequently monitoring and analysing the inertial effects that occur in response to the combination of the induced vibration and the mass flow.

=== Molecular physics ===
In polyatomic molecules, the molecule motion can be described by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As a result of the vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects will therefore be present and will cause the atoms to move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational [[energy level |levels]].

=== Ballistics ===
The Coriolis effects become important in [[external ballistics]] for calculating the trajectories of very long-range [[artillery]] shells. The most famous historical example was the [[Paris gun]], used by the Germans during [[World War I]] to bombard [[Paris]] from a range of about 120 km.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Challenger Deep''' is the deepest known point in the oceans, [[1 E4 m|10,911 meters]] (35,797 feet) deep at its maximum, near {{coor dm|11|22|N|142|36|E|}}.

==Location==
It is in the [[Pacific Ocean]], off the island of [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] group at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]]. The closest piece of land is [[Fais Island]], one of the outer islands of [[Yap]], 289 km southwest. [[Guam]] is 306 km to the northeast.

==Name==
The Challenger Deep is named after the [[Royal Navy]] survey ship ''[[HMS Challenger (1931)|Challenger II]],'' which surveyed the trench in [[1951]].

==Depth==
On [[23 January]] [[1960]], the [[US Navy]] [[Bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']] descended to the ocean floor in the trench. ''Trieste'', which was manned by [[Jacques Piccard]] and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], measured the descent as 10,916 meters (35,813 feet) deep. (Later and more accurate measurements in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be shallower, at 10,911 m or 35,797 ft.). The descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the 3 hour 15 minute ascent. They observed small [[sole (fish)|soles]] and [[flounder]]s and noted the floor consisted of [[diatom]]aceous ooze while on the bottom.

In [[1984]], a [[Japan]]ese survey vessel using a narrow, multi-beam [[echo sounder]] took a measurement of 10,923 meters (35,838 feet).

A Japanese [[robot]]ic deep-sea probe, known as ''[[Kaiko]]'', broke the depth record for unmanned probes when it reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep on [[24 March]], [[1995]]. Created by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center [http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec-e/index-e.html (JAMSTEC)], it was one of the rare few unmanned deep-sea probes in operation that could dive deeper than about 6000 meters (19,680 feet). Its recorded depth of 10,911 m (35,797 ft) for the Challenger Deep is believed to be the most accurate measurement taken yet. Unfortunately, ''Kaiko'' was lost at sea on [[29 March]], [[2003]], after just more than 8 years of service, when one of the secondary cables snapped during an approaching [[typhoon]]. Currently no other operational vehicle exists that is capable of reaching the same depths, and no other manned vehicle has come to the same depth as ''Trieste''.

==Fauna==
Recently, an analysis of the sediment samples collected by Kaiko before she sank, published in ''Science'', Vol 307, Issue 5710, pq. 689[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/307/5710/689], announced the discovery of simple organisms at 10,900 meters water depth.  While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches (&gt;7,000 m) and on the [[abyssal plain]], the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent independent [[taxa]] from those shallower ecosystems.

Out of the 432 organisms collected, the overwhelming majority of the sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled [[foraminifera]], with four of the others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera ''Leptohalysis'' and ''Reophax''. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of organic soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. As small organisms with hard calcated shells have trouble growing at extreme (10,000 m) depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in [[calcium carbonate]], scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical [[biosphere]] present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. The remaining species may have been the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.

'''Claude Louis Berthollet''' ([[December 9]], [[1748]] &amp;ndash; [[November 6]], [[1822]]) was a French [[chemist]].

Claude Louis Berthollet was born in  [[Talloires]], near [[Annecy]], [[France]].

Berthollet, along with [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds. He also carried out research into [[dye]]s and [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]es (introducing the use of [[chlorine]] as a bleach) and determined the composition of [[ammonia]]. Potassium Chlorate (KClO3), a strong oxidizer, is known as Berthollet's Salt. [[Non-stoichiometric compound]]s are also named ''berthollides'' in his honor.

He died in [[Arcueil]], France.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Chile}}The current '''Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile''', approved by [[Chile|Chilean]] voters in a tightly controlled  [[plebiscite]] on [[September 11]] [[1980]], under the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]], effective [[March 11]] [[1981]] and amended [[July 30]] [[1989]], [[1991]], [[1994]], [[1997]], [[1999]], [[2000]], [[2001]], [[2003]] and [[2005]], replaced the earlier [[constitution]] of [[1925]]. In its original permanent dispositions, it gave the President of the Republic a large amount of power; however, some of these dispositions, such as the power of dissolving the [[Lower house|Lower Chamber]] of Congress and serving eight year terms with possibility of reelection, were modified or eliminated after [[1990]], when the country regained its [[democracy]] and the Congress was reestablished. It created some new institutions, such as the Constitutional Tribunal and the [[controversy|controversial]] National Security Council (COSENA).

In its temporary dispositions, the document ordered the transition from the former [[military]] government, with [[Augusto Pinochet]] as President of the Republic, and the Legislative Power of the [[Junta|Military Junta]] (formed by the heads of the [[Navy]], [[Air Force]], National Police, and a representative of the [[Army]], the head of the Army being president of the [[republic]]), to a civil one, with a time frame of eight years, during which the Legislative Power would still be the Military Junta. It set the first eight year presidential term for Pinochet, with a [[plebiscite]] in the eighth year, in which only one candidate, nominated by the Junta, would be accepted or not. The candidate, as expected, was Pinochet himself. While the steps to follow in the case of a triumph of the &quot;yes&quot; option, which the document obviously anticipated, were clearly delineated, the steps for the &quot;no&quot; triumph were less so, but still clear enough that no serious doubt emerged when the &quot;no&quot; option actually was victorious in the [[1988]] plebiscite.

After the plebiscite, several [[Constitutional amendment|modifications]] to the Constitution were agreed and subjected to referendum, among them a simplification on the mechanism of future modification.

In [[2005]] over 50 reforms were approved, which eliminated the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (institutional senators, or senators for life) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anarchism}}''For information about the [[anarchist]] writer see [[Chris Crass]]''

[[Crass]] was an influential [[England|English]] [[anarchist]] [[punk rock]] band.

==Overview==

[[Image:Crass2.jpg|thumb|left|Crass pictured at [[Bristol]], [[September]] [[1981]]]]

Crass formed in [[1977]], based around [[Dial House]], an '[[commune (intentional community)|open house community]]' near [[Epping, England|Epping]], [[Essex, England|Essex]], in England.

Whereas the [[Sex Pistols]]' anarchism seemed to be a self-consciously [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] [[prank]], Crass's stance was more directly linked to the [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] or communalistic varieties of 20th century political thought.

Taking literally the punk manifesto of &quot;[[DIY punk ethic|Do It Yourself]]&quot;, Crass combined the use of [[song]], [[film]], [[sound collage]], [[graphic]]s and [[subversion (political)|subversion]] to launch a sustained and innovative critical broadside against all that they saw as a culture built on foundations of [[war]], [[violence]], [[sexism]], religious hypocrisy and unthinking [[consumerism]]. They were also amongst the progenitors of the [[anarcho-pacifism]] that became pervasive in the punk music scene (see also [[anarcho-punk]]).

==Origins of the band==

The band came together when Dial House founder and former member of [[avant-garde]] [[performance art]] group [[Exit (performance art group)|EXIT]] [[Penny Rimbaud]] (real name Jerry Ratter) began [[jamming]] with [[The Clash|Clash]] fan [[Steve Ignorant]], who was staying at the house at the time. Between them they put together the songs &quot;So What?&quot; and &quot;Do They Owe Us A Living?&quot; as a drums and vocals duo. For a (very) short period of time they called themselves '''Stormtrooper''', before choosing the name '''Crass''', a reference to the [[David Bowie]] song &quot;[[Ziggy Stardust]]&quot; (specifically the line &quot;The kids was just crass&quot;).
Other members of the household began to join in, and it was not long before Crass performed their first live gig as part of a [[squat]]ted street festival at Huntley Street, North London. Here they had intended to play a set of five songs; however, the &quot;plug was pulled&quot; on them by the organisers after four. Shortly afterwards they played at the legendary [[Roxy Club|Roxy]] punk club in London's [[Covent Garden]] area. By the band's own account this was a [[drunkenness|drunken]] debacle, ending in the group being ejected from the stage, and immortalised by their song &quot;Banned from the Roxy&quot; [http://www.lyricstime.com/lyrics/50021.html] and Rimbaud's essay ''Crass at the Roxy'' [http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/anthem1/anthem1_4.html]. Other early gigs included regularly playing alongside the [[UK Subs]] at the White Lion [[pub]] in [[Putney]]. These performances were often not well-attended; &quot;The audience consisted mostly of us when the Subs played and the Subs when we played.&quot; [http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/] 

[[Image:libertine1.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Eve Libertine]] performing with Crass at the [[Wapping]] Anarchist Centre, [[London]], December 1981]]

A while later, the band decided to take themselves more seriously, particularly paying more attention to their presentation. As well as avoiding [[recreational drug use|drug]]s such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] before gigs, they also adopted a policy of wearing black, [[military surplus]]-style clothing at all times, whether on or off stage. They also introduced their distinctive stage backdrop, a [[Logotype|logo]] designed by Rimbaud's friend Dave King (later of [[Sleeping Dogs Lie (band)|Sleeping Dogs Lie]]), as pictured below on the sleeve of ''[[The Feeding of the 5000 (album)|The Feeding Of The 5000]]''. This gave the band a [[militarism|militaristic]] image, which led some to accuse them of [[fascism]]. Crass countered that their uniform appearance was intended to be a statement against the &quot;cult of the personality&quot;, so that, in contrast to the norm for many [[rock band]]s, no member would be identified as the 'leader'.

The aforementioned logo represented an amalgamation of several &quot;[[icon]]s of authority&quot; including the [[Christian Cross]], the [[swastika]] and the [[Union Flag]] combined with a two headed snake consuming itself (to symbolise the idea that power will eventually destroy itself). Using such deliberately mixed messages was also part of Crass' strategy of presenting themselves as a &quot;barrage of contradictions&quot;, which also included using loud, aggressive music to promote a [[pacifism|pacifist]] message, and was in part a reference to their own [[Dada]]ist and performance art backgrounds.

The band also eshewed any elaborate stage lighting during live sets, instead preferring to be illuminated by a simple bare light bulb. The band also pioneered [[multimedia]] presentation techniques, fully utilising video technology and using back-projected films and video collages made by [[Mick Duffield]] and [[Gee Vaucher]] to enhance their performances.

[[image:crassbanner1.jpg|thumb|left|Sleeve art for Crass' ''The Feeding Of The 5000'' 12&quot; record, illustrating the band's logo]]

==[[Crass Records]]==

Crass' first release was ''The Feeding Of The 5000'', an 18 track 12&quot; 45 rpm EP on the [[Small Wonder Records|Small Wonder]] label in [[1978]]. Workers at the pressing plant initially refused to handle it due to the allegedly [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] content of the song &quot;Reality Asylum.&quot; The record was eventually released with this track removed and replaced by two minutes of silence, ironically titled &quot;The Sound Of Free Speech&quot;. This incident also prompted Crass to set up their own record label, [[Crass Records]], in order to retain full editorial control over their material, and &quot;Reality Asylum&quot; was shortly afterwards issued in a re-recorded and extended form as a 7&quot; single. A later pressing of the album on Crass Records restored the missing track.

As well as their own material, Crass Records released recordings by other performers, the first of which was the [[1980]] single &quot;You Can Be You&quot; by [[Honey Bane]], a teenage girl who was staying at Dial House whilst on the run from a children's home. Other artists included [[Zounds (band)|Zounds]], [[Flux Of Pink Indians]], [[Rudimentary Peni]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Iceland]]ic band [[KUKL]] (who included singer [[Björk]]), [[European classical music|classical]] singer [[Jane Gregory]], and the [[Poison Girls]], a like-minded band who worked closely with Crass for several years.

They also put out three editions of ''[[Bullshit Detector]]'', compilations of demos and rough recordings which had been sent to the band, and which they felt represented the [[DIY punk ethic]].

The catalogue numbers of Crass Records releases were intended to represent a countdown to the year [[1984]] (eg, 521984 meaning &quot;five years until 1984&quot;), both the year that Crass stated that they would split up, and a date charged with significance in the anti-authoritarian calendar due to [[George Orwell]]'s novel of the same name (see [[1984 (novel)]]).

==''Penis Envy'', ''Christ the Album'' and a change of strategy==

[[Image:Crass3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Crass at the [[Digbeth Civic Hall]], [[Birmingham]], 1981]]

Crass released their third album ''[[Penis Envy (record)|Penis Envy]]'' in [[1981]]. This marked a departure from the somewhat [[testosterone]]-driven 'hardcore punk' image that ''Feeding of the 5000'' and its follow up ''[[Stations of the Crass]]'' had to some extent given the group. It featured more complex musical arrangements and exclusively female vocals provided by [[Eve Libertine]] and [[Joy De Vivre]] (although Steve Ignorant remained a group member and is credited on the record sleeve as ''not on this recording'').

The album addressed [[feminist]] issues and once again attacked the institutions of 'the system' such as [[marriage]] and [[sexual repression]]. One track, a deliberately [[saccharine]] [[parody]] of a '[[MOR]]' love song entitled &quot;Our Wedding&quot;, was given away as a [[flexi disc]] with a teenage girl's romance magazine after the magazine was offered it by an organisation calling itself &quot;Creative Recording And Sound Services&quot; (note the initials). A minor [[tabloid]] controversy resulted once the hoax was revealed, with the [[News of the World]] going so far as to state that the album's title was &quot;too obscene to print&quot;.

The band's fourth LP, [[1982]]'s double set ''[[Christ The Album]]'', took over a year to record, produce and mix, during which time the [[Falklands War]] had broken out and ended. This caused Crass to fundamentally question their approach to making records. As a group whose primary purpose was to comment upon political issues, they felt they had been overtaken and made to appear redundant by real world events. Subsequent releases, including the singles &quot;How does it Feel to Be the Mother of A Thousand Dead&quot; and &quot;Sheep Farming in the Falklands&quot;, and the album ''[[Yes Sir, I Will]]'', saw the band strip their sound back to basics and were issued as &quot;tactical responses&quot; to political situations. They also anonymously produced a flexi-disc featuring a live recording of &quot;Sheep Farming...&quot;, copies of which were randomly inserted into the sleeves of other records by sympathetic workers in distribution warehouses as a means of spreading their views to those who might not normally hear them.

==Direct Action, 'Thatchergate' and internal debates==
[[Image:Stations.jpeg|thumb|left|Detail from front cover artwork from ''Stations of the Crass'', illustrating an example of the stenciled graffiti used by the band ]]
From their earliest days of spraying stencilled [[graffiti]] around the [[London Underground]] network [http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html], the band had always been involved in [[direct action]] as well as musical activities. In [[1983]] and [[1984]] they were part of the [[Stop the City]] actions that can be seen as fore-runners of the early 21st century [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalisation protest]]s. Explicit support for such activities was given in the lyrics of the band's final single release &quot;You're Already Dead&quot;, which also saw Crass abandoning their long time commitment to pacifism. This led to further introspection within the band, with some members feeling that they were beginning to become embittered as well as losing sight of their essentially positive stance. As a reflection of this debate, the next release using the Crass name was ''[[Acts of Love]]'', [[European classical music|classical music]] settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud described as &quot;songs to my other self&quot; and intended to celebrate &quot;'the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self.&quot;

A further post-Falklands war [[hoax]] that originated from members of Crass garnered enough attention to elicit fears of [[KGB]] activity from the [[Reagan Administration]].  Known as 'the [[Thatchergate]] tapes', this was a [[Compact audio cassette|cassette]] featuring a faked conversation using edited [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]s' voices, in which they appeared to allege that [[Europe]] would be used as a target for [[intermediate range nuclear weapons]] in any conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Copies were leaked into the [[public domain]], and although put together totally anonymously, the British [[Observer newspaper|Observer]] [[newspaper]] was somehow able to link the tape with the band.

==Dissolution==

Crass all but retired from the public eye after becoming a particularly irritating thorn in the side of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government following the [[Falklands War]]. Questions in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and an attempted prosecution under the UK's [[Obscene Publications Act]] for their single &quot;How Does It Feel...&quot; [http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09422b.html] led to a round of court battles and what the band describe as harassment that finally took its toll. On [[July 7th]] 1984 the band played their final gig at [[Aberdare]] in [[Wales]], a benefit for [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|striking miners]], before retreating to Dial House to concentrate their energies elsewhere.

Guitarist [[Andy Palmer]] had announced that he intended to move on from the band in order to further his [[art college]] studies, and the reported group [[consensus]] was that replacing him would be &quot;like having a corpse in the band&quot;. This [[catalyst|catalysed]] the affirmation of Crass' consistently stated intention to 'split up in 1984'. Steve Ignorant went on to join the band [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], with whom he had already worked on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis, and in 1992 formed [[Schwartzeneggar]](sic). From 1997-2000, he was a member of the group [[Stratford Mercenaries]]. He has also worked as a '[[Punch and Judy]]' performer. Eve Libertine continued to record with her son [[Nemo Jones]] as well as performance artist [[A-Soma]]. Pete Wright concentrated on building himself a [[house-boat]] and formed the performance art group [[Judas 2]], whilst Rimbaud continued to write and perform both solo and with other artists.

==Influences==

The philosophical and aesthetic influence of Crass on numerous punk bands from the 1980s cannot be overstated, even if few bands mimicked their later more [[free improvisation|free-form]] musical style (as on ''Yes Sir, I Will'' and their final recording, ''10 Notes on a Summer's Day''). The band has stated that their musical antecedents and influences were seldom drawn from the [[Rock (music)|rock music]] tradition, but rather from classical music (particularly [[Benjamin Britten]], from whom, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are direct [[plagiarism]]s), [[Dadaism|Dada]] and the avant-garde such as [[John Cage]] as well as performance art traditions. Their painted and [[collage]]-art black-and-white record sleeves produced by [[Gee Vaucher]] themselves became a signature aesthetic model.

Crass has experienced a resurgence in popularity due partially to the growing popularity of the Web.

==2002 onwards: The Crass Collective/Crass Agenda/Last Amendment==

In November [[2002]] several former members of Crass collaborated under the name [[The Crass Collective]] to arrange ''Your Country Needs You'', a concert of &quot;voices in opposition to war&quot; held at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on [[London]]'s South Bank that included a performance of Britten's ''[[War Requiem]]''. In October 2003, the Crass Collective changed their working title to [[Crass Agenda]], and they continue to perform regularly.  During 2004 Crass Agenda were at the forefront of the campaign to save the ''[[Vortex Jazz Club|Vortex]]'' Jazz Club in [[Stoke Newington]], North [[London]], which has now relocated to [[Hackney]]. In June 2005 Crass Agenda was declared to be 'no more', subsequently changing the name of the project to the 'more appropriate' [[Last Amendment]].

A &quot;new&quot; Crass track (actually a remix of 1982's &quot;Major General Despair&quot;, with new lyrics), &quot;The Unelected President&quot;, is also available [http://www.peace-not-war.org/Music/Crass/index.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Crystallography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''crystallon'' = cold drop / frozen drop, with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and ''graphein'' = write) is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of [[atom]]s in [[solid]]s. In older usage, it is the scientific study of [[crystal]]s.

Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on the geometry of the crystals.  This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to theoretical reference axes ([[crystallographic axes]]), and establishing the [[symmetry]] of the crystal in question.  The former is carried out using a [[goniometer]]. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net, e.g. [[Wolff net]] or [[Lambert net]].  In fact, the [[pole]] to each face is plotted on the net.  Each point is labelled with its [[Miller Index]].  The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established.  

Crystallographic methods now rely on the analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns that emerge from a sample that is targeted by a beam of some type. The beam is not always [[electromagnetic radiation]], even though [[X-ray]]s are the most common choice. For some purposes [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s are used, which is possible due to the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of illumination used when referring to a method, as with the terms '''[[X-ray diffraction]],''' '''[[neutron diffraction]]''' and '''[[electron diffraction]].''' 

These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. [[X-ray]]s interact with the spatial distribution of the [[valence electrons]], while [[electron]]s are [[charged particle]]s and therefore feel the total charge distrubution of both the [[atomic nuclei]] and the surrounding electrons. [[Neutron]]s are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the [[strong nuclear force]]s, but in addition, the [[magnetic moment]] of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by [[magnetic field]]s. Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

== Theory ==

In many cases, an image of a microscopic object is generated by focusing the rays of the [[optical spectrum|visible spectrum ]] using a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] as in light [[microscope|microscopy]].  However, because the wavelength of visible light is long compared to [[chemical bond|atomic bond]] lengths and [[atom]]s themselves, it is necessary to use radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays.  Employing shorter wavelengths implies abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created. (That said, scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic [[Fresnel zone plate]]s made from gold). Generally, in diffraction-based imaging, the only wavelengths used are those that are too short to be focused. This difficulty is the reason that crystals must be used.

Because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals are an ideal material for analyzing the structure of solids.  To use X-ray diffraction as an example, a single X-ray photon diffracting off of one electron cloud will not generate a strong enough signal for the equipment to detect.  However, many X-rays diffracting off many electron clouds in approximately the same relative position and orientation throughout the crystal will result in constructive [[interference]] and hence a detectable signal.

== Notation ==

See [[Miller index]] for a full treatment of this topic.

* Coordinates in ''square [[bracket]]s'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[100]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a direction (in real space).

* Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' or ''chevrons'' such as '''&lt;100&gt;''' denote a ''family'' of directions which are equivalent due to symmetry operations.  If it refers to a cubic system, this example could mean &lt;nowiki&gt;[100], [010], [001]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or the negative of any of those directions.

* Coordinates in ''parentheses'' such as '''(100)''' denote a plane, in a cubic system the [[normal]] to the  (hkl) plane is the direction [hkl].

* Coordinates in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{100}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a family of plane normals which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

== Technique ==

Some materials studied using crystallography, DNA for example, do not occur naturally as crystals.  Typically, such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days, weeks, or months through vapor [[diffusion]].  A drop of solution containing the molecule, buffer, and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a [[hygroscopic]] solution.  Water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form.  If the concentration were to rise more quickly, the molecule would simply [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal.

Once a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of radiation.  Although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own X-ray producing equipment, [[Synchrotron light|Synchrotron]]s are often used as X-ray sources, because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of x-ray beams, so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources. 

Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]] and often an iterative process of '''modelling and refinement.''' In this process, the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or &quot;model&quot; structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample. Ideally, researchers make several initial guesses, which through refinement all converge on the same answer.  Models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model. This is a painstaking process, made much easier today by computers.  

The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''patterns,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystalize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by fibers and powders, which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules (the double-helical structure of [[DNA]], for example, was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample).

== Materials science ==

Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect  the atomic structure.  In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects.  The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding [[crystallographic defect]]s.

A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography.   For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates.  

In another example, [[iron]] transforms from a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) structure to a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure called [[austenite]] when it is heated.  The fcc structure is a close-packed structure, and the bcc structure is not, which explains why the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs.

Crystallography is useful in phase identification:  That is, when performing some kind of processing on a material, it is often desired to find out what compounds and what phases are present in the material.  Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms.  Techniques like X-ray diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present (note: the determination of the &quot;phases&quot; within a material should not be confused with the more general problem of &quot;phase determination,&quot; which refers to the phase of waves as they diffract from planes within a crystal, and which is a necessary step in the interpretation of complicated diffraction patterns).

Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason has a relation to group theory and geometry.  See [[Symmetry group]].

== Biology ==

X-ray crystallography is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].  In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data.  The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958 (Kendrew, J.C. et al. (1958) A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis (Nature 181, 662-666). The [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of [[protein]]s and other biological macromolecules. [[RasMol]] can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.

[[Electron crystallography]] has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably [[membrane protein]]s and [[viral capsid]]s.

Field Marshal '''Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]], [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ([[June 21]] [[1884]] - [[March 23]] [[1981]]), nicknamed '''The Auk''', was a British army commander during [[World War II]]. 

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Aldershot]], he grew up in impoverished circumstances, but was able through hard work and scholarships to graduate from [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]], [[Sandhurst]]. Claude Auchinleck was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in [[India]], where he developed a love of the country and an affinity for the ordinary soldiers under his command. 

==World War II==

===Norway===
Early in World War II Auchinleck was given command of the [[Allied forces]] in [[Norway]] in May [[1940]], a military operation that was doomed to fail. After the fall of Norway, in July 1940 he became briefly General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, and then Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]].

===North Africa===
Following the see-saw of Allied and Axis successes and reverses in North Africa, Auchinleck was appointed to succeed General (later Field Marshal) Sir [[Archibald Wavell]] as C-in-C of the Allied Forces in the Middle East in July [[1941]]; Wavell took up Auchinleck's post as C-in-C of the Indian Army, swapping jobs with him.

General Auchinleck was C-in-C based in [[Cairo]], with responsibility not just for North Africa but also for [[Iran|Persia]] and the Middle East; the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] confronting the [[Afrika Korps|German Afrika Corps]] and the [[Italian Army]] was commanded successively by Generals Sir [[Alan Cunningham]] and Sir [[Neil Ritchie]]. The first major offensive by Eighth Army, [[Operation Crusader]] in November 1941 resulted in the defeat of much of the British armour and the breakdown of Cunningham. Auchinleck relieved Cunningham, and ordered the battle to continue. Despite heavy losses, the Afrika Korps were driven back to El Agheila. Auchinleck then appointed Ritchie to command Eighth Army, while Auchinleck resumed overall strategic direction of the Middle East theatre. The Afrika Korps retook Benghazi in January of 1942 and then operations ended for the next four months. [[Rommel]]'s attack at Gazala of [[May 25]] [[1942]] was a significant defeat for the British. Eighth Army retreated back into [[Egypt]]; [[Tobruk]] (which was of great political significance to [[Winston Churchill]] but of limited military importance to Auchinleck) fell on [[21 June]]. Once more Auchinleck stepped in to take direct command of the Eighth Army. The German/Italian advance was finally halted at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] by the Eighth Army, but attempts by Auchinleck to turn the battle into an outright victory were failures. 

The Auk, as he was known to his troops, was unfortunate in some of his subordinate senior officers in North Africa: some were incompetent, some were killed and some were captured. Auchinleck - an Indian Army officer - had little direct experience or understanding of British and Dominion troops, which may explain his poor appointments. Auchinleck's desire for the Eighth Army to fight in mobile 'Brigade Groups' rather than Divisions was resisted by many subordinates. His brilliant but erratic chief of staff, [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]], was regarded with considerable distrust by many of the senior commanders in Eighth Army. By July 1942 Auchinleck had lost the confidence of Dominion commanders and relations with his British commanders had become strained.

Like his foe Rommel (and his predecessor Wavell), Auchinleck was subjected to constant political interference, having to weather a barrage of hectoring telegrams and instructions from Prime Minister Churchill throughout late 1941 and the spring and summer of 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck, and was (understandably) downcast at the military reverses in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Churchill was desperate for some sort of British victory before the planned Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], scheduled for November 1942. He badgered Auchinleck immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after the first battle of El Alamein. Churchill flew to Cairo in August 1942, purportedly for consultations with Auchinleck, but it is now obvious that Churchill had made up his mind to replace Auchinleck before the meeting. It is believed that Auchinleck refused to order a major offensive before his troops were properly prepared. 

He was replaced as C-in-C Middle East by General [[Harold Alexander]] (later Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis) and as GOC Eighth Army by Lt-General [[William Gott]], who was killed in Egypt before taking up command. On Gott's death,  Lt-General (later Field Marshal Viscount) [[Bernard Montgomery]] was appointed commander of the Eighth Army. Auchinleck's reputation (along with that of many other officers) subsequently suffered unfairly at the hands of the Montgomery publicity machine, a disservice that was repeated by Churchill in his own war memoirs. Indeed, Montgomery launched his [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein offensive]] on [[23 October]] 1942, even later than the date proposed by Auchinleck while still in command.

===India===
Churchill offered Auchinleck command of Allied Forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and the Middle East (this having been hived off Alexander's command), but the Auk declined this post, possibly as it was held by his Indian Army friend and colleague General Sir [[Edward Quinan]]. Instead he returned to India, where he spent almost a year &quot;unemployed&quot; before in [[1943]] becoming again Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, Wavell meanwhile having been appointed [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]]. Auchinleck retained this post after the end of the war.

==Post-war life==
[[Image:Monty, wavvel, auk.jpg|thumb|200px|Auchinleck as C-in-C of the Indian Army, with the then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]] and [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]].]]
Much against his own convictions, Auchinleck helped prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies prior to [[Partition of India|Partition]] scheduled for August [[1947]]. In [[1946]] he was promoted to field marshal but he refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable. Having disagreed sharply with [[Lord Mountbatten]], the last [[Viceroy of India]], he resigned as C-in-C and retired in 1947. In [[1948]] the Auk returned to Britain his wife having left him for another officer in 1946.

Although a somewhat dour character, he was known as a generous and welcoming host. Despite being a general for longer than almost any other soldier, he was never pompous, and hated all forms of display and affectation. Above all, he was a soldier of the utmost integrity who was popular with his troops, and respected by his foes. Rommel considered him to be one of the greatest generals of the war. In retirement, the Auk moved to [[Marrakesh]], where he lived quietly in a modest flat for many years, befriended and cared for by Corporal Malcolm James Millward, a serving soldier, up until the death of Sir Claude in [[1981]].

      <comment>/* Critical psychology around the world */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Critical psychology is both a critique of &quot;mainstream&quot; [[psychology]] and an attempt to apply psychology in more progressive ways (based, for example, on [[marxism|Marxist]] or [[feminism|feminist]] analyses) and contexts than have thus far been the case. There are a number of textbooks of critical psychology and at least two critical psychology institutes, in [[Manchester]] and [[Sydney]]. Compare: [[critical theory]].

== Critical psychology around the world ==

'''Germany'''

Critical psychology started in the [[1970s]] in Berlin at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]], and the German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field.  Critical psychology here is not really seen as a division of psychology; it follows its own methodology.  It tries to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] base.  The appeal of critical psychology to socialists is that it is an attempt to come to grips with the social and the historical &quot;conditionality&quot; of human beings.  One of the most important books in the field is the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' (''Foundations of Psychology'') by [[Klaus Holzkamp]] (Frankfurt a. M. 1983), who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. 
Some years ago the department of critical psychology at the FU-Berlin was closed and was added to the traditional psychology department.  Nevertheless, this approach of psychology is still alive.

'''South Africa'''

The University of KwaZulu-Natal in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], is one of few worldwide to offer a [http://www.ukzn.ac.za/psychology/default.asp masters course in critical psychology]. For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on [http://www.criticalmethods.org/collab/critpsy.htm Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards]. They have also now started a [http://critpsy.blogspot.com/ critical psychology blog].

'''United States and Canada'''

Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust ''status quo''. No departments of critical psychology exist, though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within community psychology departments. North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet  [http://radpsynet.org Radical Psychology Network] and the 1997 publication of [http://dennisfox.net/critpsy/book.html Critical Psychology: An Introduction] (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky).

Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist roots to benefit from other critical approaches.  Consider ecopsychology and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled [[radical psychology]] and [[liberation psychology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the military tactic of crossfire. For alternate meanings, see [[Crossfire (disambiguation)]].''

A '''crossfire''' is a military term for the siting of weapons (often automatic weapons such as machine guns) so that their arcs of fire overlap. This tactic came to prominence in [[World War I]].

               \
                \
              (gun)
==Mutual support==
Siting weapons this way is an example of the application of the defensive principle of ''mutual support''.  The advantage of siting weapons that mutually support one another is that it is difficult for an attacker to find a covered approach to any one defensive position.  

Use of armour, air support, indirect fire support, and stealth are tactics that may be used to assault a defensive position. However when combined with land-mines, snipers, barbed wire, and air cover, crossfire became a difficult tactic to counter in the early 20th century.

==Trench warfare==
The tactic of using overlapping arcs of fire came to prominence during [[World War I]] where it was a feature of [[trench warfare]]. [[Machine gun]]s were placed in groups, called machine gun nests, and they protected the front of the trenches. Many lives were lost in futile attempts to charge across the [[no man's land]] where these crossfires were set up.

The significance of crossfires is that they rendered useless what had been the most effective weapon of warfare since the Greek [[phalanx]]: massed infantry. Though [[World War II]] had more casualties overall, the relative number of deaths compared to the number of soldiers was more than twice as high in WWI, and the soldiers died much more quickly in the battles of World War I as they went &quot;over the top&quot; into the meat grinder known as no man's land. 

Three things changed between WWI and WWII rendered the crossfire obsolete: the advance of armored vehicles (especially tanks), the advent of aerial bombardment, and the invention of the proximity fuze. 

[[Tank]]s were invented in WWI specifically because they were immune to machine gun fire, and could thus cross no man's land to destroy the [[machine gun]] nests. Their armored hulls also provided cover for the infantry to advance around the tanks. The tanks in WWI were ponderously slow and prone to stalling, however, so they tipped the balance in the favor of the [[Great Britain|British]], but not decisively. In WWII, the tanks improved greatly in speed and reliability, and could reach a machine gun nest at reduced risk since it spent less time exposed.

[[Airplane]]s were present in WWI, but they were used primarily for recon and the outcome of the battle in the air didn't have a lot of effect on the ground battle. The pilots often experimented with carrying things like hand grenades to drop on the enemy, but they were largely ineffective. In WWII airplanes could bomb enemy lines, rendering any large stationary target vulnerable to destruction. Fighters also strafed enemy lines with machine gun fire.

The [[proximity fuze]] allowed bombs and munitions to detonate when an object passed within a certain range (usually about 50 feet (15 m)) rather than using an impact or timed fuze. Timed fuzes are tricky because the range has to be pre-set correctly. Impact fuzes are bad against flying targets because they have a very small targeting silhouette, and they're bad against ground targets because the projectile has time to embed in the ground before it explodes, deflecting the explosive power upward. Proximity fuzes were developed by the [[U.S. Navy]] during WWII, and they proved instrumental in defending the fleets from aerial attack since a gunner using bullets with proximity fuzes only had to get close to hitting the enemy to knock him from the sky. Proximity fuzes were also instrumental in the battle for Britain because, after the gunners changed to proximity fuzes, not a single [[Germany|German]] bomb made it past the guns. The fuze also permitted the heavy [[artillery]] to detonate above ground, permitting the explosive power to be fully utilized against targets on the ground. The trenches of WWI, for instance, wouldn't have been effective protection against a bombardment using proximity fuzes.

Any of the above three technologies would have rendered the crossfire useless. Modern warfare has not returned to big blocks of infantry because the above inventions also kill massed infantry well, and with the perfection of shoulder launched rockets and precision bombing, stationary targets are too vulnerable to be as deadly as the crossfire was in WWI.

[[Image:Cruiser at Green Island Panama.jpg|thumb|right|A cruising sailboat anchored in the [[San Blas Islands]], in [[Panama]].  The islands are an idyllic destination enjoyed by many cruisers.]]
'''Cruising''' by boat is a lifestyle that involves living full-time on a boat while traveling from place to place.  Cruising generally refers to trips of a few days or more, and can extend to round-the-world voyages.  Cruising is done on both [[sailboat|sail]] and [[motorboat|power]] boats, although sail predominates over longer distances, as ocean-worthy power boats are considerably more expensive.

Many cruisers are &quot;long term&quot; and travel for many years, the most adventurous circling the globe over a period of three to ten years.  Many others take a year or two off from work and school for short trips and the chance to experience the cruising lifestyle.

[[Dinghy sailing|Dinghy sailors]] may also be &quot;cruisers&quot;, and in this case the word refers to someone who sails just for fun, maybe to go from A to B, but equally likely just to sail around for a few hours - in fact, any sailing activity that does not involve [[Dinghy racing|racing]].

&quot;Cruising&quot; may also refers to trips on [[cruise ship]]s, and those who take frequent cruise ships vacations (multiples times per year) may be called &quot;cruisers&quot;.
 
== History ==

[[Image:Dugout in San Blas Islands.jpg|thumb|right|Cruisers can see traditional life in remote areas of the world; here, a [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] local paddles a dugout canoe in the [[San Blas Islands]].]]
One of the first people to carry out a long-distance voyage for pleasure, and who inspired many others to follow in his path, was [[Joshua Slocum]], who [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world between [[1895]] and [[1898]].  Despite widespread opinion that such a voyage was impossible, Slocum, a retired sea captain, built a 37-foot sloop, ''Spray'', and sailed her [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] around the world.  His book ''Sailing Alone Around the World'' is still considered a classic adventure, and inspired many others to take to the seas.&lt;ref&gt;''Sailing Alone Around the World'', Captain Joshua Slocum; Sheridan House, 1954. ISBN 0911378200&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cruising authors have provided both inspiration and useful instruction to would-be cruisers.  Key among these are Lin and Larry Pardey, who in [[1969]] set off on a short cruise from the USA to Mexico, which turned into a circumnavigation of the world.  They wrote a series of books about their voyage, as well as several reference books on cruising.

== Techniques ==

As well as normal sailing and seamanship skills, cruisers use a variety of equipment and tehniques to make their voyages possible, or simply more comfortable.

[[Image:Solar_panels_on_yacht_at_sea.jpg|thumb|right|The solar panels on this 28-foot yacht can keep her self-sufficient in electrical power.]]
One of the key areas is providing the electrical power to keep the boat's systems (lights, communications gear, etc.) running.  Although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines, and some carry generators, carrying sufficient fuel for these over a long voyage con be a problem; and so many cruising boats are equipped with generating devices such as [[solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, etc.

While it is quite possible (and, until relatively recently, normal) to cruise without long-distance communications equipment, such gear is becoming more common on cruising boats.  Many boats are now equipped with [[satellite telephone]] systems; however, these systems can be expensive to use, and may operate only in restricted areas.  Many cruisers still rely on the older [[short wave]] maritime [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] radio stadard, which has no running costs, and can (with suitable equipment) allow sending and receving of email.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:cavitating-prop.jpg|300px|thumb|Cavitating propeller model in a [[water tunnel]] experiment]]

Cavitation is the phenomenon where small and largely empty cavities are generated in a [[fluid]], which expand to large size and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp [[sound]]. Cavitation occurs in pumps, propellers, impellers, and in the vascular tissues of plants.

==Overview==
Following the definition of Christopher E. Brennen: A liquid when it is subjected to a low [[pressure]] (tensile stress) above a threshold it ruptures and forms vaporous cavities. This phenomenon is termed cavitation. When the local ambient [[pressure]] at a point in the liquid falls below the liquid's [[vapor pressure]], the liquid can undergo a phase change, creating largly empty voids termed cavitation bubbles. Other possiblities to generate cavitation bubbles involve the local deposition of energy. This can be achieved by focusing an intense laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark.

The physical process of cavitation is almost exactly the same as that which occurs during [[boiling]].  The major difference between the two is how the phase change is affected.  Boiling raises the vapor pressure of the liquid above its local ambient pressure to cause the phase change to a gas.

In order for cavitation to occur, the cavitation &quot;bubbles&quot; generally need a surface on which they [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container and by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These preexisting bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed a pressure below the a threshold pressure termed [[Blake's threshold]].

==Problems==
Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence.  In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a  great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency.

When the cavitation bubble collapse, they focus liquid energy to very small volumes. Thereby, they create spots of high temperature and emit shock waves which are the source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem in [[submarine|submarines]], as the noise destroys its [[stealth]].

The collapse of cavities involves very high energies, and can cause major damage.  Cavitation can damage almost any substance.  The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller or pump's lifetime.

==Beneficial Uses==
Although cavitation is undesirable in many circumstances, this is not always the case.  For example, [[supercavitation|supercavitating]] torpedoes in use by the military envelope the torpedo in a large bubble of cavitation.  By eliminating contact with water, and, therefore, eliminating the high drag of water, these torpedoes can move very fast underwater, perhaps even at [[supersonic]] speeds.  

Cavitation can also be a boon in ultrasonic cleaning devices.  These devices affect cavitation using sound waves and use the collapse of the cavitation bubbles to clean surfaces. Used in this manner, the need for sometimes environmentally harmful chemicals can be reduced in many industrial and commercial processes that require cleaning as a step. Still the details on how bubbles clean are not understood.

In industry, cavitation is often used to homogenize, or mix and break down suspended particles in a colloidal liquid compound, such as paint mixtures, or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design, or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice: the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into the larger volume causes cavitation to take place. This method can be controlled with hydraulic devices that control the size of the inlet orifice, and this allows for adjustment to the process &quot;on the fly&quot;, or for different substances. The outer surface of this type of mixing valve, upon which the cavitation bubbles are driven against to cause their implosion, undergoes tremendous stress, and is often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as stainless steel, Stellite, or even polycrystalline diamond (PCD).  

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminesence]].

==Biomedical application==
Cavitation plays an important role for the destruction of [[kidney stone]]s in shock wave lithotripsy ([[lithotriptor]]). Currently it is tested if cavitation can be used to transfer large molecules into biological [[cell (biology)|cell]]s ([[sonoporation]]).

==Pumps and propellers==
Major places where cavitation occurs are in [[pump]]s, on [[propeller]]s, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump), or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades.  The faster the blades move, the lower the [[pressure]] around it can become. As it reaches vapor pressure, the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[bubble]]s of gas.  This is cavitation.  When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shockwaves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

===Suction cavitation===
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low pressure/high vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition has large chunks of material removed from its face causing premature failure of the pump.

===Discharge cavitation===
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge is extremely high. It normally occurs in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump cutwater at extremely high [[velocity]]. This velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the cutwater (similar to what occurs in a [[venturi]]) which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump cutwater. In addition due to the high pressure condition premature failure of the pump mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation is believed to be the cause of [[cracking knuckles|the cracking of joints]].

==Cavitation in engines==
Some bigger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder]] walls. The result is pit holes in the cylinder wall that let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with chemical additatives in the cooling fluid that form a protecting layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed from the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself.

==Vascular plants==
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the water potential becomes so great that dissolved air within the water expands to fill the plant cell - either vessel elements or [[tracheid|tracheids]]. Plants are generally able to repair cavitated xylem, for example with root pressure, but for others such as vines, cavitation often leads to mortality. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is clearly audible.

The '''Cyprinodontiformes''' is an order of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], also called the '''Microcyprini''', and comprising mostly small, fresh-water fish.  They are closely related to the [[Atheriniformes]] and are occasionally included with them.  Many popular aquarium fish, such as [[killifish]] and [[live-bearing aquarium fish|live-bearers]], belong here.

Members of this order are notable for inhabiting harsh environments, such as saline or very warm waters, water of poor quality, or isolated situations where no other types of fish occur. They are typically omnivores, and often live near the surface, where they the oxygen-rich water compensates for environmental disadvantages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Holy_sepulchre_exterior.jpg|thumb|280px|Main Entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]The '''Church of the Holy Sepulchre''', called the '''Church of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]''' (''Anastasis'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] and ''Surp Harutyun'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) by [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]]s, is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[church]] now within the walled [[Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. The ground on which the church rests is venerated by most Christians as [[Golgotha]], the [[Calvary|Hill of Calvary]], where the [[New Testament]] describes that [[Jesus]] was [[crucifixion|crucified]]. It also is said to contain the place where Jesus was reportedly buried (the [[sepulchre]]). The church has been an important [[pilgrimage]] destination since the [[4th century]]. Today it serves as the headquarters of the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Archpriest]] of the [[Basilica]] of the Holy Sepulchre.

==History==
[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] describes in his ''Life of Constantine'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7646_3165242] how the site of the Holy Sepulchre, originally a site of veneration for the Christian community in Jerusalem, had been covered with earth and a temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] had been built on top. Although Eusebius does not say as much, this would probably have been done as part of [[Hadrian]]'s reconstruction of Jerusalem as [[Aelia Capitolina]] in [[135]], following the destruction of the [[Jewish Revolt]] of [[70]] and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] of [[132]]&amp;ndash;[[135]]. Following his conversion to Christianity, Emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] ordered in about [[325]]/[[326]] that the site be uncovered, and instructed Saint [[Macarius of Jerusalem|Macarius]], Bishop of Jerusalem, to build a church on the site. [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (born c. [[380]]), in his ''Ecclesiastical History,'' gives a full description of the discovery [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-02/Npnf2-02-06.htm#P394_149362] (that was repeated later by [[Sozomen]] and by [[Theodoret]]) that emphasizes the role played in the excavations and construction by Constantine's mother [[Helena, mother of Constantine the Great|Helena]], to whom is also credited the rediscovery of the [[True Cross]]. 

[[Image:Tomb of christ sepulchre.jpg|thumb|280px|The Edicule of the Holy Sepulchre (The Tomb of Christ) with the dome of the rotunda visible above.]]
Constantine's church was built around the excavated hill of the Crucifixion, and was actually three connected churches built over the three different holy sites, including a great [[basilica]] (the ''Martyrium'' visited by the nun [[Egeria]] in the 380s), an enclosed [[colonnade]]d [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] (the ''Triportico'') built around the traditional Rock of Calvary, and a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], called the ''Anastasis'' (&quot;Resurrection&quot;), which contained the remains of the cave that Helena and Macarius had identified with the burial site of Jesus. The surrounding rock was cut away, and the Tomb was encased in a structure called the ''Edicule'' ([[Latin]] ''aediculum'', small building) or the ''Kouvoulkion'' ([[Greek language|Greek]], shrine) in the center of the rotunda. The [[dome]] of the rotunda was completed by the end of the 4th century.

This building was damaged by fire in [[614]] when the [[Sassanid dynasty|Persians]] under [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrau II]] invaded Jerusalem and captured the Cross. In [[630]], Emperor [[Heraclius]] marched triumphantly into Jerusalem and restored the True Cross to the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Under the [[Jerusalem#Arab Caliphates.2C Christian Crusaders.2C and early Ottoman rule .28638-1800s.29|Muslims]] it remained a Christian church. The early Muslim rulers protected the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction and their use as living quarters, but after a riot in [[966]], when the doors and roof were burnt, the original building was completely destroyed on [[October 18]], [[1009]] by the &quot;mad&quot; [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], who hacked out the Church's foundations down to bedrock. The Edicule and the east and west walls and the roof of the cut-rock tomb it encased were destroyed or damaged (contemporary accounts vary), but the north and south walls were likely protected by rubble from further damage.

However, a series of small chapels was erected on the site by [[Constantine IX]] Monomachos in [[1048]] under stringent conditions imposed by the caliphate. The rebuilt sites were taken by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on [[July 15]], [[1099]]. The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader chief [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use the title &quot;king&quot; during his lifetime, and declared himself ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'', &quot;Protector (or Defender) of the Holy Sepulchre.&quot; The chronicler [[William of Tyre]] reports on the reconstruction in the mid-12th century, when the crusaders began to renovate the church in a [[Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the holy sites and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in [[1149]]. The church became the seat of the first Latin Patriarchs, and was also the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. The church was lost to [[Saladin]], along with the rest of the city, in [[1187]], although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century, while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, leading to the curious result of the holiest church in Christianity being laid under [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]]. Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezmians]] in [[1244]]. 

The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated it further in [[1555]], as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. A fire severely damaged the structure again in [[1808]], causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Edicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Edicule's exterior were rebuilt in [[1809]]&amp;ndash;[[1810]] by architect Komminos of [[Mytilene]] in the then current Turkish [[Baroque]] style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Edicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration. The current dome dates from [[1870]]. Extensive modern renovations began in [[1959]], including a restoration of the dome from [[1994]]&amp;ndash;[[1997]]. The cladding of red marble applied to the Edicule by Komminos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since [[1947]] it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]]. No plans have been agreed upon for its rennovation.

===Status quo===
Since the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable ''[[firman]]'' from the ''[[Sublime Porte]]'' at a particular time, often through outright bribery. In 1767, weary of the squabbling and the violence that often accompanied it, the ''Porte'' issued a ''firman'' that divided the church among the claimants.  This was confirmed in 1852 with another ''firman'' that made the arrangement permanent, establishing a ''[[status quo]]'' of territorial division among the communities.

The primary custodians are the [[Greek Orthodox]], the [[Armenian Apostolic Church| Armenian Apostolic]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures within and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.

Establishment of the ''status quo'' did not halt the violence, which continues to break out every so often even in modern times.  On a hot summer day in 2002, the Coptic monk who is stationed on the roof to express Coptic claims to the Ethiopian territory there moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/129/52.0.html]
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;width:200px;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Holy sepulchre ladder.jpg|thumb|180px|none|The immovable ladder. Detail from photograph of main entrance above, taken in 2005.]]
[[Image:Holy sepulchre ladder 1890s.png|thumb|180px|none|The ladder in 1892.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
In another incident in 2004 during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open.  This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out.  Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1314466,00.html]

Under the ''status quo'', no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all commuities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovation of the ''edicule'', where the need is now dire but where also any change in the structure might result in a change to the ''status quo'' disagreeable to one or more of the communities.

A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance.  A wooden ladder was placed there sometime before 1852, when the ''status quo'' defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. The ladder remains there to this day, in almost exactly the same position it can be seen to occupy in century-old photographs and engravings.

None of the communities control the main entrance.  For centuries, two neutral neighbouring Muslim families appointed by [[Saladin]], the Nuseibeh and Joudeh families, were the custodians of the key to the single door, which is unlocked at set times in cooperation with one of the communities on a rotating schedule. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times.  For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death. On [[June 20]], [[1999]], the communities agreed to install a new exit door in the church. There was never any report of this door being completed.

==Modern arrangement of the church==
[[Image:Holy_sepulchre.jpg|thumb|The Stone of the Anointing, believed to be the place where Jesus' body was prepared for burial. It is the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Station of the Cross.]][[Image:Anastasia Rotonda sketch 1.png|thumb|Floor Plan Sketch]]The entrance to the church is through a single door in the south [[transept]]. The key to the entrance is held by the Muslim Nuseibeh family who were entrusted with guardianship by Saladin in 1192 to keep the peace between the various Christian factions. After periods of tension between the Nuseibeh family and the Ottoman authorities in the 18th century, the Ottoman authorities appointed the Joudeh family to assist the Nuseibeh's in their task. Today, the Joudeh family still assists the Nuseibeh's by bringing the key of the church to a member of the Nuseibeh family who unlocks and locks the door on a daily basis.

Just inside the entrance is the Stone of Anointing, believed to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial. To the left, or west, is the [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]] of the Anastasis beneath the larger of the church's two domes, in the center of which is the Educule of the Holy Sepulchre itself. Under the ''status quo'' the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] celebrated by the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]]. To its rear, within a chapel constructed of iron latticework upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Orthodox]]. Beyond that to the rear of the Rotunda is a very rough hewn chapel believed to be the tomb of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] in which the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays. To the right of the sepulchre on the southeastern side of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.

On the east side opposite the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox [[catholicon]]. The second, smaller dome sits directly over the center of the transept crossing of the [[Choir (disambiguation)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an [[omphalos]] once thought to be the center of the world, is situated. East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Greek Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the Patriarchal throne and a throne for visiting episcopal celebrants. On the south side of the altar via the [[ambulatory]] is a stairway climbing to the Chapel of [[Calvary]], or Golgotha, believed to be the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The main altar there belongs to the Greek Orthodox, while the Roman Catholics have an altar to the side. Further to the east in the ambulatory are the stairs descending to the Chapel of St. Helena, belonging to the Armenians. From there, another set of stairs leads down to the Roman Catholic Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross, believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

==Authenticity==
As noted above, both Eusebius and Socrates Scholasticus record that the tomb of Jesus was originally a site of veneration for the Christian community in Jerusalem and its location remembered by that community even when the site was covered by Hadrian's temple. Eusebius in particular notes that the uncovering of the tomb &quot;''afforded to all who came to witness the sight, a clear and visible proof of the wonders of which that spot had once been the scene''&quot; (''Life of Constantine'', Chapter XXVIII [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7655_3169703]). 

Archaeologist Martin Biddle of [[Oxford University]] has theorized that this &quot;clear and visible proof&quot; might have been [[graffiti]] to the effect of &quot;This is the Tomb of Christ&quot;, scratched in the rock by Christian pilgrims before the construction of the Roman temple. Similar ancient graffiti are still visible in the [[Catacomb]]s of Rome, indicating the tombs of especially venerated saints, or even (to give a modern, secular example) scratched on tombstones in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] to direct [[Doors]] fans to the grave of [[Jim Morrison]].

From the time of its original construction in 335, and despite numerous renovations, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has been venerated as the authentic site of Jesus's crucifixion and burial. 
[[Image:Anastasia Rotonda 4th century floor plan 2.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the site in IV Century]]

In the [[nineteenth century]], a number of scholars disputed the identification of the Church with the actual site of Jesus's crucifixion and burial. They reasoned that the Church was inside the city walls, while early accounts (''e.g.'', [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 13:12) described these events as outside the walls. On the morning after his arrival in Jerusalem, [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] selected a rock-cut tomb in a cultivated area outside the walls as a more likely site for the burial of Jesus. This site is usually referred to as the Garden Tomb to distinguish it from the Holy Sepulchre, and it is still a popular pilgrimage site for those (usually Protestants) who doubt the authenticity of the Anastasis and/or do not have permission to hold services in the Church itself.

However, it has since been determined that the site was indeed outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion. The Jerusalem city walls were expanded by [[Herod Agrippa]] in [[41]]&amp;ndash;[[44]], and only then enclosed the site of the Holy Sepulchre, at which time the surrounding garden mentioned in the Bible would have been built up as well. To quote the [[Israeli]] scholar Dan Bahat, former City Archaeologist of Jerusalem:

: &quot;We may not be absolutely certain that the site of the Holy Sepulchre Church is the site of Jesus' burial, but we have no other site that can lay a claim nearly as weighty, and we really have no reason to reject the authenticity of the site.&quot; (Bahat, 1986)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cernunnos.jpg|right|Cernunnos|thumb|350px|Depiction of Cernunnos from the ''Pilier des nautes'', Paris]]
'''Cernunnos''' in  [[Celtic polytheism]] is the deified [[spirit]] of horned male animals, especially of [[stag]]s, a nature god associated with produce and fertility. As a  &quot;[[Horned God]]&quot;, Cernunnos was one of a number of similar deities found in many ancient cultures.

==Origins==
Cernunnos is known, from archaeological sources such as inscriptions and depictions, to have been worshipped in [[Gaul]], Northern Italy ([[Gallia Cisalpina]]) and the southern coast of [[Ancient Britain|Britain]]. The earliest known probable depiction of Cernunnos was found at [[Val Camonica]] in [[Italy]], dating from the [[4th century BC]], while the best known depiction is on the famous [[Gundestrup cauldron]] of pre-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Denmark]], dating to the [[1st century BC]]. 

In [[Gallo-Roman religion]], his name is known from the &quot;[[Pillar of the Boatmen]]&quot; (''Pilier des nautes''), a monument now displayed in the [[Musée Nationale du Moyen Age]] in [[Paris]]. It was constructed by Gaulish sailors in the early [[first century CE]], from the inscription (CIL XIII number 03026) probably in the year 14, on the accession of the [[Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. It was found in [[1710]] in the foundations of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] on the site of [[Lutetia]], the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Parisii]] tribe. It depicts Cernunnos and other [[Celtic mythology|Celtic deities]] alongside [[Roman mythology|Roman divinities]] such as [[Jupiter]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], [[Castor]], and [[Pollux]]. 

The ''Pilier des nautes'' provides the earliest written record of the deity's name. Additional evidence is given by two identical inscriptions on metal plaques from [[Seinsel-Rëlent]] in [[Luxembourg]], in the territory of the Celtic [[Treveri]] tribe. These inscriptions (AE 1987, 0772) read ''Deo Ceruninco'', &quot;to the God Cerunincos&quot;. Lastly, a Gaulish inscription (RIG 1, number G-224) written in [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] letters from [[Montagnac]] ([[Hérault]], [[Languedoc-Roussilion]], [[France]]) reads ''αλλετ[ει]υος καρνονου αλ[ι]σο[ντ]εας'' thus giving the name &quot;Carnonos&quot;.

==Etymology==
On the Parisii inscription ''[_]ernunnos'', the first letter of the name has been scraped off at some point, but can safely be restituted to &quot;Cernunnos&quot; because of the depiction of an antlered god below the name and the fact that in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], ''carnon'' or ''cernon'' means &quot;antler&quot; or &quot;horn&quot; (Delmarre, 1987 pp. 106-107). Similarly ''cern'' means &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;bumb, boss&quot; in Old Irish and is etymologically related to similar words ''carn'' in Welsh and Breton. These derive from a proto-Indo-European root ''*krno-'' which also gave the Latin ''cornu'' and Germanic ''*hurnaz'' (from which English &quot;horn&quot;) (Nussbaum 1986) (Porkorny 1959 pp.574-576).
The same Gaulish root is found in the names of tribes such as the [[Carnutes]], [[Carni]], and [[Carnonacae]] and in the name of the Gaulish war trumpet, the [[carnyx]].
Therefore, the [[Proto-Celtic]] form of this [[theonym]] can be reconstructed as either *''Cerno-on-os'' or *''Carno-on-os'', both meaning &quot;horned masculine deity&quot;. The -on- is frequently, but not exclusively, found in theonyms (examples: [[Maponos|Map-on-os]], [[Epona|Ep-on-a]], [[Matronae|Matr-on-ae]], [[Sirona|Sir-on-a]]).
Following accepted Celtic [[sound law]]s, the [[Romano-British]] [[form]] of this Proto-Celtic theonym is likely to have been ''*Cernonos'' or ''*Carnonos'' both directly comparable to the Gaulish form Cernunnos.

==Iconography==
[[Image:Gundestrup_A.jpg|right|Cernunnos|thumb|350px|Depiction of Cernunnos from the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].]]

The depictions of Cernunnos are strikingly consistent throughout the Celtic world. His most distinctive attribute are his stag's horns, and he is usually portrayed as a mature man with long hair and a beard. He wears a [[torc]], an ornate neck-ring used by the Celts to denote nobility. He often carries other torcs in his hands or hanging from his horns, as well as a purse filled with coins. He is usually portrayed seated and cross-legged, in a position which some have interpreted as [[meditation|meditative]] or [[shaman|shamanic]], although it may only reflect the fact that the Celts squatted on the ground when hunting.

Cernunnos is nearly always portrayed with animals, in particular the [[stag]]. He is also frequently associated with a unique beast that seems to belong primarily to him: a serpent with the horns of a [[ram (sheep)|ram]]. This creature may have been a deity in its own right. He is associated with other beasts less frequently, including [[bull]]s (at [[Reims]]), [[dog]]s and [[rat]]s. Because of his frequent association with creatures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the &quot;Lord of the Animals&quot; or the &quot;Lord of Wild Things&quot;. Because of his association with stags (a particularly hunted beast) he is also described as the &quot;Lord of the Hunt&quot;. Interestingly, the ''Pilier des nautes'' links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Reims (Marne, Champagne, France) - in antiquity, Durocortorum, the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Remi]] tribe - and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the [[Treveri]].

==Medieval traces==
Traces of the god survived well into Christian times. The literary traditions of both Wales and Ireland contain allusions to him, while in [[Brittany]] the legendary saint [[Korneli]] (or Cornély) at Carnac has attributes of Cernunnos. It has also been suggested that the [[English mythology|English myth]] of [[Herne the Hunter]] is an allusion to Cernunnos, though this seems doubtful as Herne is thought to be a survival of Saxon, rather than Celtic, beliefs and is first mentioned in [[1597]] in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Act 4, Scene 4.

==Neo-Paganism==
===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], imagery derived from historical Celtic culture is sometimes used, including a depiction of Cernunnos, often referred to as [[The Horned God]]. This version of Cernunnos is based little on historical findings and more on phallic symbolism, merged from elements of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. The adherents generally follow a life-fertility-death cycle for Cernunnos, though his death is now usually set at [[Samhain]], the Gaelic New Year Festival usually taking place on October 31. It should be noted, however, that Wicca is in no way an exact reconstruction of historical Celtic religion and culture, despite claims by some Wiccans. [http://www.clannada.org/wicca.php]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Manner of articulation}}
'''Clicks''' are [[stop consonant|stops]] produced with two articulatory closures in the oral cavity. The pocket of air enclosed between the two closures is rarefied by a sucking action of the [[tongue]]. The release of the more forward closure produces what in many cases are the loudest consonants in the language, although in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]], clicks are more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejective stops]]. Clicks appear more stop-like or more [[affricate]]-like depending on their place of articulation: Clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp like plain stops, while [[labial consonant|bilabial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks have a longer and acoustically noisier sounds that are more like affricates.

==Distribution==

Clicks occur in all the [[Khoisan languages]] of southern Africa, and in several neighbouring [[Bantu languages]], such as Nguni ([[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Swati language|Swazi]], [[Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], and [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]] from Khoisan languages. Clicks also occur in [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]], two languages of [[Tanzania]] traditionally classified as Khoisan, as well as in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]].

The Southern African Khoisan languages only permit [[root word|root]]-initial clicks. [[Hadza]], [[Sandawe]], and several of the [[Bantu language]]s also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots, but in no language does a click close a syllable or end a word. 

The only non-African language known to employ clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a secret ritual code used by speakers of [[Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an ''egressive'' click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) &quot;spurt&quot;. English and many other languages may use clicks in interjections, such as &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; or &quot;gee-up&quot;.

==Types of clicks==
As noted above, clicks necessarily involve two closures: an anterior one which is represented by the special click symbol in the IPA, and a posterior one which is usually [[velar consonant|velar]] but can also be [[uvular consonant|uvular]]. This posterior articulation may be oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. (It's quite easy to pronounce a nasal click once you realise that while maintaining the double oral closure you're free to breathe through the nose.) Since the posterior articulation is most commonly velar (and can only be velar in most languages), only the place of the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx'') is normally mentioned, while only the manner of the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux'') is specified. Thus a &quot;nasal dental click&quot; means a click with a dental anterior articulation/release and a velar-nasal posterior articulation/accompaniment. 

There are numerous combinations of elements making up a click accompaniment, some of them quite daunting. These include voiceless, voiced, aspirate, breathy voiced, nasal, voiceless nasal, breathy voiced nasal, glottalized, voiceless nasal glottalized, affricate, ejective affricate, prevoiced, prenasalized, and others as well, including extremely complicated combinations such as a voiced velar click followed by voiceless affricated ejective, {{IPA|[gk!x’]}}, and a velar ejective click followed by uvular ejective, {{IPA|[k!’q’]}} (Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996). This means that pentagraphs like ''gk!x’'' are possible in a practical orthography. However, many of these combinations are [[consonant cluster]]s rather than separate phonemes. 

The size of click inventories ranges from as few as four for the Dahalo language of Kenya, to dozens in the Northern and Southern [[Khoisan language]]s, and up to 83 clicks (including 50 simple clicks) in [[!Xóõ]] (Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996). In the latter language, over 70% of words begin with a click.

==Transcription==
The five click releases with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[bilabial click|bilabial]] {{IPA|ʘ}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|ǀ}}, [[palatal click|palato-alveolar]] or &quot;palatal&quot; {{IPA|ǂ}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] or &quot;retroflex&quot; {{IPA|ǃ}}, and [[alveolar lateral click|alveolar lateral]] {{IPA|ǁ}}. The retroflex and palatal releases are &quot;abrupt&quot;; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The bilabial, dental, and lateral releases, on the other hand, are &quot;noisy&quot;: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (They can, however, still have either affricate or non-affricate accompaniments.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] releases, {{IPA|ǃ}} and {{IPA|ǁ}}, are sometimes called &quot;grave&quot;, because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; while the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] releases, {{IPA|ǀ}} and {{IPA|ǂ}}, are sometimes called &quot;acute&quot;, because they are dominated by high frequencies. Thus the alveolar {{IPA|ǃ}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low pitched pop), at least in Xhosa; while the dental {{IPA|ǀ}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!'', a high pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The bilabial {{IPA|ʘ}} is different than what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a [p] or an [m], not rounded as they are for a [w]. 

The [[IPA]] came up with a set of Latin-based symbols for these sounds, but they were never much used, and were eventually given up for the Khoisanist symbols.

There are a few less well attested releases, such as a noisy laminal denti-alveolar lateral release (Ⅲ [triple pipe] in an ''ad hoc'' transcription), which contrasts with an apical postalveolar lateral in Mangetti Dune !Kung; an abrupt sub-apical retroflex release &lt;‼&gt; in Angolan !Kung; and a &quot;slapped&quot; alveolar click {{IPA|[!¡]}} in Hadza and Sandawe, where the tongue slaps the bottom of the mouth after the release. (These distinctions may suffice for the Damin releases as well.) However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click releases will be found. 

Technically, when a full click consonant (that is, an accompaniment plus release) is transcribed, a tie bar should be used, because the accompaniment overlaps the release in time. (For example, in a nasal click such as {{IPA|[ŋ͡ǂ]}}, the nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is pronounced before, during, and after the release {{IPA|[ǂ]}}.) However, a tie bar is not often used in practice, and when the accompaniment is a simple [k], it will sometimes be omitted as well. That is, {{IPA|[ǂ]}} = {{IPA|[kǂ]}} = {{IPA|[ǂk]}} = {{IPA|[k͡ǂ]}} = {{IPA|[ǂ͡k]}}. 

The accompaniment is generally written first: {{IPA|[ŋ͡ǂ]}} or {{IPA|[ŋǂ]}}. However, many Khoisanists prefer to write the accompaniment second: {{IPA|[ǂ͡ŋ]}} or {{IPA|[ǂŋ]}}. This is because the diacritics which follow the click symbols belong to the accompaniment rather than the release. A prime example of this are the ejective clicks, as {{IPA|[ǂ͡q’]}}. Here it is the uvular {{IPA|[q’]}} that is ejective, not the palatal click release {{IPA|[ǂ]}}, and the IPA convention of writing {{IPA|[q͡ǂ’]}} is misleading. Regardless, elements which do not overlap with the release are always written accordingly: The prenasalization is always written first in {{IPA|[ŋɡ͡ǂ]}} = {{IPA|[ŋǂ͡ɡ]}}, and the second ejective is always written afterwards in {{IPA|[k͡ǂ’q’]}} = {{IPA|[ǂ͡k’q’]}}. 

While the [[SAMPA]] encoding for IPA into [[ASCII]] doesn't have symbols for transcribing clicks, the proposed [[X-SAMPA]] standard does: &lt;tt&gt; O\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;|\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;|\|\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;=\&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;.  Some instead suggest &lt;tt&gt;||\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;#\&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&quot;\&lt;/tt&gt; for the alveolar lateral click. The [[Kirshenbaum]] system uses a different method: clicks are denoted by digraphs, with the click symbol (always &quot;!&quot;) added to the stop homorganic to the release, but with the manner of the accompaniment. For example, /t!/ is a voiceless dental click, and /m!/ is a nasal bilabial click. (This transcription is used in the literature on Damin.) However, the International Phonetic Association recommends using the IPA symbols in [[Unicode]], or using the number codes which they have assigned to each symbol.

==Accompaniments==
(Data is primarily from Ladefoged; see references at individual language articles.)

There is a great variety of click accompaniments, though it is a matter of debate how many of them are simple consonants and how many consonant clusters. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages may be equivalent to each other. 

Some Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic_typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters, such as {{IPA|dt͡s’k͡x’}}, so it's not unexpected that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well, and this can be taken as evidence that these clicks are also clusters. 

There is ongoing discussion as to which other clicks are best analysed as consonant clusters, as in several cases this is not obvious. For example, some linguists feel that ejective clicks are not possible, and that those described as such are most likely clusters. Indeed, in many languages this appears to be the case. However, in others phonetic measurements have found that, while the ejective release follows the click release, it is the accomplaniment closure that is ejective, not a subsequent consonant. (In Ladefoged's analysis in the table below, if there is only a single segment, this is indicated by a single non-subscript letter for the accompaniment.) 

Of the languages illustrated below, [[!Xóõ language|!Xóõ]] is Southern Khoisan, [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Korana language|Korana]], and [[G/wi language|Gǀui]] are Central Khoisan, [[Ju/’hoan language|Zhuǀ’hõasi]] is Northern Khoisan, and [[‡Hõã language|‡Hoan]] is unclassified. These languages are spoken primarily in [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]. (See [[List of Khoisan languages]] for classification.) [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language of [[South Africa]]; [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] is a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language of [[Kenya]]; [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] are spoken in [[Tanzania]]; and [[Damin]] was an initiation jargon in northern [[Australia]]. 

The four Dahalo accompaniments occur only with a dental release. Damin has only a nasal accompaniment with its normal clicks, but in addition has a voiceless unaspirated release for its egressive &quot;click&quot;. 

For clarity, the full accompaniment is written after the release, and the tie bar is omitted.

==Releases==

===Inventories of click releases===

There are seven known click releases, not counting slapped or egressive clicks. These are ''bilabial affricated'' {{IPA|ʘ}}, or &quot;bilabial&quot;; ''laminal denti-alveolar affricated'' {{IPA|ǀ}}, or &quot;dental&quot;; ''apical (post)alveolar plosive'' {{IPA|ǃ}}, or &quot;alveolar&quot;; ''laminal postalveolar (palato-alveolar) plosive'' {{IPA|ǂ}}, or &quot;palatal&quot;; ''subapical postalveolar (retroflex)'' {{IPA|ǃ˞}} (rare); and two lateral clicks, which in the only language known to distinguish them are ''laminal denti-alveolar lateral'' {{IPA|ǁ̻}} and ''apical postalveolar lateral'' {{IPA|ǁ̺}}. No language is known to have more than five of these.

==Click loss==
We do not know how clicks first arose, and the development of clicks from other consonants has never been observed, but it seems likely that they arose from consonant clusters of some type. 

However, several still vibrant languages demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[List_of_Khoisan_languages#East_Tshu-Khwe|East Tshu-Khwe languages]] have lost a large percentage of their clicks, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. Generally a click is replaced by a consonant that retains the [[manner of articulation]] of the accompaniment. Alveolar click releases {{IPA|ǃ}} tend to simply drop out, leaving a velar stop or affricate such as {{IPA|k, ɡ, ŋ, k͡x}}, while palatal clicks {{IPA|ǂ}} leave behind a palatal stop such as {{IPA|c, ɟ, ɲ, c’}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|ʧ, ʤ}}, and dental clicks {{IPA|ǀ}} tend to leave an alveolar affricate {{IPA|ʦ}} behind. That is, in the latter cases the resulting consonant retains the manner of the accompaniment but the [[place of articulation|place]] of the release.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:cider house rulezzz.jpg|thumb|200px|The Cider House Rules book cover]]
This article relates to the novel, [[The Cider House Rules]] by [[John Irving]]. [[The Cider House Rules (film)]] is also a [[1999]] [[film]] starring [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Michael Caine]], directed by [[Lasse Hallström]].

==Plot of The Cider House Rules==
{{spoiler}}
Homer Wells, an un-adopted [[orphan]], is the book's central protagonist; Homer grew up in an orphanage directed by Dr. Wilbur Larch. Dr. Larch is also secretly an [[abortion]]ist, and believes that he is doing the world a service because &quot;one way the [[poor]] can help themselves would to be in control of the size of their families.&quot; Dr. Larch also refers to abortion as &quot;The Lord's Work&quot; and trains Homer in the realm of gynecology/abortions in a paternal way. The novel continues as Homer decides to leave the orphanage with Candy Kendall and her boyfriend Wally Worthington, a young couple who work at the Worthington family apple orchard. Wally leaves to fight in [[World War Two]], but his plane is shot down over [[Burma]]. Believing Wally to be dead, Homer and Candy have an affair and Candy subsequently becomes [[pregnant]]. Candy secretly gives birth to a boy named Angel at the orphanage (the first child to go home with its mother). Wally is found alive, so Candy and Homer return home, lying to the family about Angel's parentage (they claim that Homer decided to adopt him). Wally and Candy [[marry]] shortly afterwards. Many years later, when Angel is a teenager, he makes friends with Rose Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose, a migrant worker. Rose Rose becomes pregnant with her father's child, and Homer performs an abortion on her. Homer decides to return to the orphanage after the [[death]] of Dr. Larch, and works as the new director. Homer and Candy eventually tell Angel that they are his biological parents.

The novel also follows a sub-plot of Melony, Homer's fellow orphan, and her [[lesbian]]-lover, Lorna.

==Controversy==
The novel clearly takes a pro-choice stance on abortion. Dr. Larch, the novel's primary abortion-advocate, feels strongly towards the &quot;[[left]]&quot; on the subject because he believes an infant who is unwanted is too emotionally painful for the mother and the child. Homer is initially reluctant with the subject, but understands Dr. Larch's perception when he must perform an abortion on Rose Rose. The novel also introduces [[adoption]] as an alternative.

Many [[pro-life]] groups contend that the uncommon scenario of a father-daughter [[rape]] is not a strong argument for the legalization of all abortions. The novel also takes on many other cases of an abortion being a necessary option for a woman, including the extremely poor, [[prostitutes]] who are incapable of raising a child, and in one instance a young woman who had a botched abortion and died after her &quot;abortionist&quot; left the [[crochet]] needle in her uterus. Irving uses her as an example for people who are going to perform their own &quot;back alley&quot; abortions and need medical assistance for their own safety. Pro-life organizations state that the novel is [[pro-choice]] propaganda, and the assumption that Homer will grow up to be a [[moral]] man if he performs abortions is a poor image.

'''Consumers''' are [[individual]]s or [[household]]s that consume [[Good (economics)|goods and services]] generated within the [[economic system|economy]].  Since this includes just about everyone, the [[term]] is a political term as much as an economic term when it is used in everyday speech.  Typically when businesspeople and economists talk of ''consumers'' they are talking about ''person as consumer'', an aggregated [[commodity]] item with little [[individuality]] other than that expressed in the buy not buy [[decision]]. However there is a [[trend]] in [[marketing]] to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad [[demographic profile]]  and [[psychographic profile]]s of [[market segment|market segments]], marketers are engaging in [[personalized marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization]]. 

A consumer is assumed to have a [[budget]] which can be spent on a [[range]] of [[Product (business)|goods and services]] available on the [[market]]. Under the assumption of [[rationality]], the budget allocation is chosen according to the [[preference]] of the consumer, i.e. to maximize his or her [[utility]] function.

In 'time series' [[model (abstract)|models]] of consumer behaviour, the consumer may also [[investment|invest]] a [[proportion]] of their budget in order to gain a greater budget in [[future]] [[period]]s. This [[investment]] [[choice]] may include either [[fixed rate]] [[interest]] or risk-bearing [[security|securities]].

In the [[context]] of [[mental health]], consumer is also a term applied to describe a [[person]] living with [[mental illness]].

Concern over the best interests of consumers has spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer [[education]] into the [[school]] [[curriculum]].  There are many non-profit publications available to assist in consumer education such as [[Consumer Reports]] or [[Choice Magazine]].

Within many [[sales|selling]] [[company (law)|companies]] as well as debt-management consultants consumer has come to be a derogatory term which means an unintelligent buyer of poorly made clothing and plastic or metallic items. Consumer could also be seen as an offensive term, implying that both an adult and a child's only function is to buy (consume) a product and discard it after only a short period of time.

'''Cactus''' is the name given to any member of the [[flowering plant]] family [[Cactaceae]]. Cacti are almost exclusively [[New World]] plants. This means that they are native only in [[North America]], [[South America]], and the [[West Indies]]. There is however one exception, ''Rhipsalis baccifera''; this species has a pantropical distribution, occurring in the [[Old World]] in tropical [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sri Lanka]] as well as in tropical America. This plant is thought to be a relatively recent colonist in the Old World (within the last few thousand years), probably carried as seeds in the digestive tracts of [[bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s. Many other cacti have become naturalized to similar environments in other parts of the world after being introduced by people.

[[Image:Cactus1web.jpg|thumb|left|Many species of cactus have long, sharp spikes.]]
Many [[succulent plant]]s in both the Old and New World
bear a striking resemblance to cacti, and are often called &quot;cactus&quot; in common usage.
This is, however, due to [[parallel evolution]];
none of these are closely related to the Cactaceae.
One distinct identifying characteric of the Cactus family
is the [[areole]], a specialized structure from which spines and new shoots grow.

Cacti are believed to have evolved in the last 30 to 40 million years. Long ago, the Americas were joined to the other continents, but separated due to [[continental drift]]. Unique species in the New World must have developed after the continents had moved apart. Significant distance between the continents was only achieved around in the last 50 million years. This may explain why cacti are so rare in Africa; the continents had already separated when cacti [[evolve|evolved]].

[[Image:Cactus flower02.jpg|thumb|left|Cactus Flower]]
Like other succulents, cacti are well-adapted to life with little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] have evolved into [[spine (biology)|spines]], which in addition to allowing less water to evaporate than regular leaves, defend the cactus against water-seeking animals. [[Photosynthesis]] is carried out by enlarged [[Plant stem|stems]], which also store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of a true cactus where this takes place. Very few members of the family have leaves, and when present these are usually rudimentary and soon fall off; they are typically awl-shaped and only 1-3 mm long. Two genera, ''Pereskia'' and ''Pereskiopsis'', do however retain large, non-succulent leaves 5-25 cm long, and also non-succulent stems; they are possibly primitive genera, thought to be closely similar to the plants that cacti evolved from.

Cacti come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Some grow to great size. Some cacti produce beautiful [[flower]]s, which like spines and branches arise from [[areole]]s. Many cactus species are night-blooming, as they are [[pollen|pollinated]] by [[nocturnal]] [[insect]]s or small animals, principally [[moth]]s and [[bat]]s. Cacti range from small and round to pole-like and tall, such as the [[Saguaro]].

A number of cactus species are cultivated for use as houseplants, as well as for ornamental gardens. They often form part of [[xeriscaping|xerophilic (dry) gardens]] in arid regions. Some cacti bear edible fruit.

==Etymology==
The word ''cactus'' is ultimately derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κακτος ''kaktos'', used in classical Greek for a species of spiny [[thistle]], possibly the [[cardoon]], and used as a generic name, ''Cactus'', by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1753 (now rejected in favor of ''Mammillaria''). There is some dispute as to the proper plural form of the word; as a Greek loan into English, the correct plural in English would be &quot;cactuses&quot;. However, as a word in [[Botanical Latin]] (as distinct from [[Classical Latin]]) &quot;cactus&quot; would follow standard Latin rules for pluralization and become &quot;cacti&quot;, which has become the prevalent usage in English.

[[Image:CCC-C&amp;O.jpg|thumb|270px|Civilian Conservation Corps workers restoring the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].]] 
The '''Civilian Conservation Corps''' ('''CCC''') was an organization established on [[March 31]], [[1933]], during [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first month in office. It was part of the social and economic relief program provided under Roosevelt's [[New Deal|First New Deal]] to combat the [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]] of the [[Great Depression]], and was one of the first measures to be introduced during the [[New Deal#The First Hundred Days|first hundred days]]. The CCC came to be seen as a rite of passage by its enrollees, and became one of the most popular New Deal programs among the general public. 

==Establishment==
Roosevelt proposed the establishment of a civilian conservation corps during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential campaign]]. During his first &quot;Hundred Days&quot; in office much of the [[New Deal]] was passed, including Senate Bill 5.598, the [[Emergency Conservation Work Act]]; it was signed into law on March 31, 1933. 

The [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Department]]'s role was to recruit participants into the program; the actual camps were operated by the Army, using reserve officers. Within a week the Labor Department organized a National Re-Employment Service for CCC recruitment. The usual requirement was that the boy's father had to be registered as unemployed.  The first CCC enrollee entered on [[1933-04-07]], just thirty-seven days after Roosevelt's [[inauguration]]. In a short time there were 250,000 enrollees working in CCC camps. Enrollment peaked in September 1935 at about 502,000. By the time the CCC disbanded in 1942, over three million young men had participated. 

There was serious concern about the CCC from the [[American Federation of Labor]] which feared it would be a job training program.  With so many union construction workers unemployed a new job training program would introduce new competition for scarce jobs.  Roosevelt promised there would be no skills taught that would compete with established unions, and named a labor leader to run the CCC.

==CCC projects and life==
[[Image:ccc we can take it.jpg|200px|thumb|right|&quot;The slogan of the Civilian Conservation Corps is 'We can take it!' Building strong bodies is a major CCC objective. More than half the enrollees who entered CCC the last year were seventeen years of age. Work, calisthenics, marching drill, good food, and medical care feature the CCC health program.&quot;]]

The CCC was an interdepartmental work and relief program that sent young, unemployed men from the cities to work on conservation projects in rural areas for $1 per day. The corps took part in many conservation projects, including prevention of [[soil erosion]] and the impounding of [[lake]]s. The CCC constructed many buildings and trails in [[state park|state]] and [[national park]]s that are still used today. Other projects of the CCC included installation of telephone and power lines, construction of logging and fire roads, fence construction, tree-planting, and even [[beekeeping]], [[archeology|archeological]] excavation, and furniture manufacture. The CCC also provided the first truly organized [[wildfire]]-fighting crews and planted  an estimated 3 billion trees for government agencies such as the [[United States Forest Service]].  

CCC enrollees worked 40 hours a week and were paid $30 a month, with the requirement that $25 of that be sent home to family. Members lived in camps, wore [[uniform]]s, and lived under quasi-[[military discipline]]. 
The U.S. Army operated the camps, using reserve presonnel called to active duty.  The Army thereby gained valuable experience in handling large numbers of young men, but there was no military drill or training in the camps, and the work projects were civilian in nature.  Eventually over 4,000 camps were be established in all 48 states and in the Hawaii, Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The first camp was at [[George Washington National Forest]] in Virginia.

Initially, the CCC was limited to young men age 18 to 25 whose fathers  were on relief. Two exceptions to the age limits were [[veterans]], who had a special CCC program and their own camps, and older people with needed skills, hired by the CCC to supervise the young men on the job. These older CCC members were known as &quot;LEMs&quot; (Local Experienced Men). In 1937, Congress changed the age limits to 17 to 23 years old, and dropped the requirement that enrollees be on relief. Members enrolled for six months, with the option of enrolling for another six months.  

In Roosevelt's second [[fireside chats|fireside chat]] on [[1933-05-07]], he spoke about the CCC in a radio address:  
:&quot;First, we are giving opportunity of employment to one-quarter of a million of the unemployed, especially the young men who have dependents, to go into the forestry and flood prevention work. This is a big task because it means feeding, clothing and caring for nearly twice as many men as we have in the regular Army itself. In creating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds with one stone. We are clearly enhancing the value of our natural resources and second, we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual distress.&quot;

==Disbandment==
Despite Roosevelt's desire that the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] make the CCC a permanent agency, Congress failed to do so. Congress did pass several bills extending the life of the CCC. The last extension passed was in 1939, extending the CCC until [[1943-06-30]].  Due to the changing manpower and budgetary needs after U.S. entry into [[World War II]], this was to be the last extension of the Civilian Conservation Corps. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on [[1941-12-07]], all CCC work, except for wildland firefighting, was shifted onto U.S. military bases to help with construction there. The agency disbanded one year earlier than planned, after Congress voted to cut off funding for the CCC entirely after [[1942-06-30]].

Former CCC sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as [[Civilian Public Service]] camps where [[conscientious objectors]] performed ''work of national importance'' as an alternative to military service. In some cases these camps permitted the original CCC work to continue.

After the CCC disbanded, the federal agencies responsible for [[public lands]] administration went on to organize their own seasonal fire crews, roughly modeled after the CCC, which filled the firefighting role formerly filled by the CCC and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience to young people.

==California Conservation Corps==
In 1976, the [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] of [[California]] established the [[California Conservation Corps]]. This new program differed drastically from the original CCC as its aim was primarily youth development rather than economic revival. Today it is the largest, oldest and longest-running youth conservation in the world.

==Corps Today==
Today, corps are state and local programs that engage primarily youth and young adults (ages 16-25) in full-time community service, training and educational activities.  The nation’s 109 corps operate in multiple communities across 37 states and the District of Columbia. In 2004, they enrolled over 23,000 young people.  The [[National Association of Service and Conservation Corps - NASCC]] works to expand and enhance the corps movement throughout America.

The '''Caribbean Sea''' is a [[tropics|tropical]] body of water adjacent to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and southeast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It covers most of the [[Caribbean Plate]] and is bounded on the south by [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]], to the west by [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], and the [[Yucatan]] peninsula of [[Mexico]], to the north by the [[Greater Antilles]] islands of [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Puerto Rico]], and to the east by the [[Lesser Antilles]].

The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest [[sea|salt water seas]] and has an area of about [[1 E12 m²|2,754,000]] km² (1,063,000 square miles). The sea's deepest point is the [[Cayman Trench]], between [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]], at [[1 E3 m|7,686]] m (25,220 feet) below sea level.

The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, especially the numerous islands, is known as the [[Caribbean]].

The '''Caribbean''', ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Caribe''; [[French language|French]]: ''Caraïbe'' or more commonly ''Antilles''; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Cariben'' or ''Caraïben'', or more commonly ''Antillen'') or the '''West Indies''', is a group of [[island]]s and countries which are in or border the [[Caribbean Sea]] which lies on the [[Caribbean Plate]].  The countries and islands of the Caribbean are located to the south and east of [[Mexico]] and to the north and west of [[Venezuela]], [[South America]]. There are at least 7,000 islands, [[islets]], [[reef]]s, and [[caye]]s in the region. They are organized into 25 territories including [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] states, overseas departments, and [[dependent area|dependencies]].

The name &quot;West Indies&quot; originates from [[Christopher Columbus]]' idea that he had landed in the [[Indies]] (then meaning all of south and east [[Asia]]) when he had in fact reached [[Americas|the Americas]]. The name &quot;Caribbean&quot; is named after the [[Carib]]s, one of the dominant [[Amerindian]] groups in the region at the time of [[Europe]]an contact. The Caribbean consists of the Greater and Lesser [[Antilles]], and is often considered part of [[North America]].

At one time, there was a short-lived country called the [[Federation of the West Indies]] composed of ten of the English-speaking Caribbean territories of the region.

The Caribbean area is also famous for its sea [[pirate]]s. See the article [[piracy in the Caribbean]].

The region known as &quot;Caribbean&quot; is usually restricted to the islands of the Caribbean Sea, although sometimes the continental American coastline is included.

==Historical groupings==
:''Main article: [[History of the Caribbean]]''

Most islands at some point were, or still are, colonies of [[Europe]]an nations:
* [[British West Indies]] / [[Anglophone Caribbean]] - [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]
* [[Danish West Indies]] - present-day [[United States Virgin Islands]]
* [[Dutch West Indies]] - present-day [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]
* [[French West Indies]] - [[Anguilla]] (briefly), [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (briefly), [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], [[Haiti]], [[Montserrat]] (briefly), [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Sint Eustatius]] (briefly), [[St Kitts and Nevis]] ([[St Kitts]], but not [[Nevis]]), [[Trinidad and Tobago]] ([[Tobago]] only), present-day [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ([[Saint Croix]] only, briefly), and the current French [[Département d'outre-mer|overseas ''départements'']] of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] (including [[Saint-Barthélemy]] and northern half of [[Saint Martin]])
* [[Spain]] - [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (present-day [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), [[Puerto Rico]]

The British West Indies were formerly united by the [[United Kingdom]] into a [[West Indies Federation]]. The independent countries which were once a part of the B.W.I. still have a unified composite [[cricket]] team that successfully competes in [[Test cricket|test match]]es and [[one-day international]]s. The [[West Indian cricket team]] includes the South American nation of [[Guyana]], the only former British colony on that continent.

In addition, these countries share the [[University of the West Indies]] as a regional entity. The university consists of three main campuses in  [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], a smaller campus in the [[Bahamas]] and Resident Tutors in other contributing territories.

'''Colin Maclaurin''' (February, [[1698]] - [[June 14]], [[1746]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[mathematician]].

He was born in Glendaruel, [[Argyll]], where his father was the minister of the parish of Kilmodan, and attended the [[University of Glasgow]] at age eleven. Entering the University at eleven was not unusual at the time, but his graduating by successfully defending a thesis at 14 was. After graduation he remained at Glasgow to study [[divinity]] for a period and in [[1717]], aged nineteen, he became professor of [[mathematics]] at Marischal College in the [[University of Aberdeen]].

In [[1725]] he was appointed deputy of the mathematical professor at [[Edinburgh]], James Gregory (brother of [[David Gregory]] and nephew of the more famous [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)| James Gregory]]), upon the recommendation of [[Isaac Newton]]. Newton was so impressed his work, he actually offered to pay Maclaurin's salary. Eventually, Maclaurin went on to succeed Gregory.

The &quot;[[Maclaurin series]]&quot; for  many [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions had in fact been first developed by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] in fourteenth century India. They were also developed and published by James Gregory, but Maclaurin wasn't aware of this and published them in ''Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa''.
Independently from [[Euler]] he discovered the &quot;[[Euler-Maclaurin formula]]&quot;.

In [[1733]] he married Anne Stewart, the daughter of the [[Solicitor General]] of [[Scotland]].  He actively opposed the  [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Rebellion of [[1745]] and assisted in the defence of Edinburgh but had to flee to [[York]] upon the approach of the Highlanders. He returned after the Jacobite army marched south, but the events had damaged his health, and led indirectly to his death.

Some of his important works:

*''[[Geometria Organica]]'' - [[1720]]
*''[[De Linearum Geometricarum Proprietatibus]]'' - [[1720]]
*''[[Treatise on Fluxions]]'' - [[1742]] (763 pages in two volumes. The first systematic exposition of Newton's methods.)
*''[[Treatise on Algebra]]'' - [[1748]] (two years after his death.)
*''[[Account of Newton's Discoveries]]'' - Incomplete upon his death and published in [[1750]] or [[1748]] (sources disagree.)

:'''''Note:''' the term &quot;head of the Faith&quot; is used throughout the article, it is helpful to note that, since 1963, this refers to the elected nine-member [[Universal House of Justice]].''

A '''Covenant-breaker''' or the act of '''Covenant-breaking''' is a term used by [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] to refer to a particular form of [[heresy]]. Being declared a Covenant-breaker by the head of the Faith is somewhat equivalent to [[Cherem]] in Judaism, [[Excommunication]] in Christianity and [[Takfir]] in Islamic law, i.e. Bahá'ís avoid association with them, even if the Covenant–breaker is a family member.  The authority to declare a Bahá'í a Covenant-breaker resides solely with the head of the Bahá'í Faith, which since 1963 has been the (elected) [[Universal House of Justice]], situated in [[Haifa]], Israel.

==Definition==
Covenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from those who are not Bahá'ís or who have left the Bahá'í Faith out of disagreement with its tenets.  Rather is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition whereby the Covenant-breaker is seen to be as one who is challenging the internal succession of the Faith and thereby causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure.

In a letter to an individual dated [[23 March]] [[1975]], the Universal House of Justice wrote: 
:&quot;When a person declares his acceptance of Bahá'u'lláh as a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If he then turns round and attacks Bahá'u'lláh or the Central Institution of the Faith he violates the Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help that person to see the illogicality and error of his actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with the instructions of Bahá'u'lláh Himself, be shunned as a Covenant-breaker.&quot;

The term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqidin', was first used by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] to describe the partisans of his brother [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], who challenged his leadership.  In `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], He appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith and called for the eventual election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], and defined in the same manner opposition to these two institutions as Covenant-Breaking.  `Abdu'l-Bahá advised all Bahá'ís to shun anyone opposing the Covenant: &quot;...one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past.&quot; [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-2.html#gr10]

==Categorization==
=== Included categories of people ===
While most Covenant-breakers are involved in schismatic groups, that is not always the case.  For example, a Bahá'í who refuses to shun Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article [http://bahai-library.com/?file=momen_encyclopedia_covenant], originally written for the Bahá'í Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bahá'í history as belonging to one of four categories:

#Leadership challenge: These are persons who dispute the authority and legitimacy of the head of the religion and advanced claims either for themselves or for another. The main examples of these are [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], and [[Mason Remey|Charles Mason Remey]].
#Dissidence: Those who disagree with the policies and actions of the head of the religion without, however, advancing an alternative claim for leadership. This group consisted mostly of opponents of the Bahá'í administration such as [[Ruth White]], [[Ahmad Sohrab]], and [[Hermann Zimmer]].
#Disobedience: Those who disobey certain direct instructions from the head of the religion.  Mostly the instruction in question is to cease to associate with a Covenant-breaker. Examples of this type include most of the descendants of `Abdu'l-Bahá during Shoghi Effendi's time.
#Apostates who maliciously attack the Bahá'í Faith. Examples include [[Ávárih]] and [[Níkú]].

=== Excluded categories of people === 

Shoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957: &quot;''People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bahá'ís and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers.''&quot; (cf: Shoghi Effendi, Messages to Canada, p. 64)  Beyond this, many other relationships to the Bahá'í Faith exist, both positive and negative.  Covenant-breaking does not seem to apply to most of them. 

The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed covenant-breakers:

* Members of other religions or no religion without any particular relationship to the Bahá'í Faith.
* Followers of [[Mirza Yahya Nuri Subh-i Azal|Subh-i-Azal]], Baha'u'llah's half-brother, who are known in modern times as Bayanis are often mistakenly referred to by this label.  The appelation seems, however, misapplied.  Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broke it, and Bayanis never swore allegence to Baha'u'llah, they cannot therefore be said to have broken his covenant.
* Bahá'ís who simply leave the faith. (see above)
* Bahá'ís who, in the estimation of the head of the religion have insufficiently understood the nature of the covenant from the start.  These are sometimes &quot;disenrolled&quot; and are considered to have never actually been Bahá'ís, given their fundamental diversion from this core Bahá'í doctrine.
* External enemies of the Bahá'í Faith.

==Current groups==
{{main|Bahá'í divisions}}
Most of the currently active groups regarded by the larger group of Bahá'ís as Covenant-breakers originated in the claims of Charles Mason Remey to the Guardianship in 1960.  The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]] states that Guardians should be [[lineal primogeniture|lineal descendant]]s of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and that each Guardian must select his successor during his lifetime, and that the nine [[Hands of the Cause of God]] permanently stationed in the [[holy land]] must assent to the appointment to avoid ambiguity.  While most Bahá'ís interpret lineal descendency to mean physical familial relation to Bahá'u'lláh, some have interpreted this to include spiritual and/or adoptive descendants.

The majority of Bahá'ís accepted the determination of the [[Hand of the Cause of God|Hands of the Cause]] upon the death of Shoghi Effendi, that he passed away &quot;without having appointed his successor&quot;, owing to an absence of both a will and a valid descendant of Bahá'u'lláh who could qualify under the terms of the `Abdu'l-Bahá's will. Later the [[Universal House of Justice]], first elected in [[Haifa]] in [[1963]], made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.  

In 1960 Mr. Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed had been coerced.  He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi.  He and the small number of Bahá'ís who followed him were expelled from the majority group by the Hands of the Cause.

The largest of the remaining followers of Mr. Remey, members of the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]], believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella.  They believe this succession, and thus whomever Mr. Marangella so appoints to be in keeping with the provisions of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá regarding the appointment of future guardians.  They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers.

Some groups outside the majority consider the right to declare someone a covenant breaker to have been ended with the passing of Shoghi Effendi, and therefore members of these groups often choose to associate with non-members.  These are often shunned, however, by those who believe that such authority persists in the House of Justice.

The present descendents of expelled members of Bahá'u'lláh's family have not specifically been declared Covenent-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bahá'í religion.  A small group of Bahá'ís in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendents are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bahá'u'lláh to arise as the rightful Guardian.

There also existed a small number of &quot;Free Bahá'ís&quot; in Europe who accepted Ruth White and Hermann Zimmer's claim that the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá' was a forgery. These claims too were rejected by the largest group of Bahá'ís in Haifa who consider these groups as Covenant-breakers.

Since the time of Bahá'u'lláh until the present, the many attempts by individual Bahá'ís to create schism or division have ended in failure during the lifetime of the individual. This is seen by Bahá'ís as a confirmation of Abdu'l-Baha's warning
:&quot;Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him.&quot;
::(Abdu'l-Baha, The Will and Testament, p. 12)

The median income for a household in the village is $46,500, and the median income for a family is $54,531. Males have a median income of $39,167 versus $23,594 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the village is $19,348.  5.2% of the population and 4.8% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 3.1% of those under the age of 18 and 7.1% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Chaos Computer Club (CCC)''' is one of the biggest and most influental [[hacker]] organisations. The CCC is based in [[Germany]] and other [[German Language|German]]-speaking countries and currently has about 1,500 members. 

The CCC describes itself as &quot;a galactic community of life's beings, independent of age, sex, race or societal orientation, which strives across borders for freedom of information&amp;hellip;.&quot; In general, the CCC struggles for more transparency in governments, freedom of information and a [[human rights|human right]] to [[communication]]. Supporting the principles of the [[hacker ethic]], the club also fights for free access to computers and technological infrastructure for everybody. 

== History ==

The CCC was founded in [[Berlin]] on [[September 12]], [[1981]] by [[Wau Holland]] and others in anticipation of the prominent role that information technology would play in the way people live and communicate. The Germans' sensitivity to [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]&amp;ndash;like scenarios (as they had already experienced two of their own&amp;mdash;the [[Nazi]] era and the [[Stasi]] system of the [[GDR]]) might have played a role in the formation of the CCC. Today, Germans in general tend to be much more critical of all kinds of public [[surveillance]] than is common in other countries.

The CCC became world famous when they hacked the German [[Bildschirmtext]] computer network and succeeded in getting a bank in [[Hamburg]] to debit the online account with [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 134,000 in favour of the club. The money was returned the next day in front of the press.

In [[1989]], the CCC was peripherally involved in the first cyberespionage case to make international headlines.  A group of [[West Germany|German]] hackers led by [[Hagbard (Karl Koch)|Karl Koch]] (who was loosely affiliated with the CCC) was arrested for breaking into US government and corporate computers and selling operating-system source code to the Soviet [[KGB]].

The CCC is more widely known for its public demonstrations of security risks. In [[1996]], CCC members demonstrated an attack against [[Microsoft]]'s [[ActiveX]] technology, changing personal data in a [[Quicken]] database from the outside. In April [[1998]], the CCC successfully demonstrated the cloning of [[GSM]] customer card, circumventing the A10 encryption algorithm.

In [[2001]], the CCC celebrated its twentieth birthday with an interactive light installation dubbed [[Project Blinkenlights]] that turned the building [[Haus des Lehrers]] in [[Berlin]] into a giant computer screen. A follow up installation (dubbed &quot;[[Video arcade|Arcade]]&quot;) at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] was the world's biggest light installation ever.

== Events ==

[[Image:Ccc2003PirateTent.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''CCC 2003 camp near Berlin'']]

The CCC hosts the annual [[Chaos Communication Congress]], Europe's biggest hacker congress, with up to 3,500 participants. Every four years, the [[Chaos Communication Camp]] is the outdoor alternative for hackers worldwide.

Members of the CCC also participate in various technological and political conferences around the planet.

== Publications ==

The CCC publishes the quarterly magazine [[Datenschleuder]] (&quot;data catapult&quot;), and the CCC in [[Berlin]] also produces a monthly radio show called [[Chaosradio]] which picks up various technical and political topics in a three-hour [[talk radio]] show. The program is aired on a local radio station named [[Fritz (radio)|Fritz]].

== Members ==

Famous members are co-founder [[Wau Holland]] and [[Andy Müller-Maguhn]], who was a member of the [[ICANN]] board of directors for Europe until [[2002]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''You might be looking for other senses of the word &quot;[[convention]]&quot;.

A '''convention''' is a set of [[agreement|agreed]], stipulated or generally accepted [[rule]]s, [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], standards or [[criterion|criteria]], often taking the form of a [[custom]].

Certain types of rules or customs may become [[law]], and regulatory [[legislation]] may be introduced to formalise or enforce the convention (eg. laws which determine which side of the [[road]] vehicles must be driven). In a [[social]] context, a convention may retain the character of an &quot;unwritten&quot; '''law''' of custom (eg. the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands).

In [[physical science]]s, numerical values (such as constants, quantities, or scales of measurement) are called '''conventional''' if they do not represent a measured property of nature, but originate in a '''convention''', for example an average of many measurements, agreed between the scientists working with these values.

==General==
A '''convention''' is a rule or a selection from among two or more alternatives, where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants. Often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community.  For instance, it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands.  Some conventions are explicitly legislated; for example, it is conventional in [[United States|America]] and [[Germany]] that motorists [[rules of the road|drive on the right side of the road]], whereas in [[England]] and [[Barbados]] they drive on the left.  The extent to which [[justice]] is conventional (as opposed to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]) is historically an important debate among [[philosopher]]s.

The nature of conventions has raised long-lasting philosophical discussion. [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] published influential writings on the subject. Lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in [[Margaret Gilbert]]'s ''On Social Facts''. Another view of convention comes from [[Ruth Millikan]]'s ''Language:  A Biological Model'' (2005), once more against Lewis.

==Customary or social conventions==
In every field of [[art]], [[science]], or other human endeavor, there are '''conventions''' that may simply be expectations (strangers being introduced shake hands, [[painting]]s are rectangular) or stock devices (a [[comedy]] ends with a marriage, but a [[cowboy]] [[film]] can end with the hero riding off into the sunset). There are '''generic conventions''' which are very closely tied to a particular artistic ''[[genre]]'', and may even help to define what that genre is. Terms such as [[fan convention]]s and [[science fiction convention]]s could be interpreted in this manner, but more often refer to the meaning of &quot;[[convention (meeting)|convention]]&quot; as a gathering or the physical location of a gathering.

==Government==
In [[government]], '''''convention''''' is a set of unwritten rules which the participants in the government are expected to follow. These rules can be ignored only if justification is clear, or can be provided. Otherwise, consequences are sure to follow. Consequences may include ignoring some other convention that has until now been followed. According to the traditional doctrine (Dicey), conventions cannot be enforced in courts, because they are non-legal sets of rules. Convention is particularly important in the [[United Kingdom]] and other governments using the [[Westminster System]] of government (e g [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]) where many of the rules of government are unwritten.  

==International law==
The term '''convention''' is also used in [[international law]] to refer to certain formal statements of principle such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Conventions are adopted by international bodies such as the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[United Nations]]. Conventions so adopted usually apply only to countries that ratify them, and do not automatically apply to member states of such bodies. These conventions are generally seen as having the force of international [[treaty|treaties]] for the ratifying countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For '''Cauchy completion''' in [[category theory]], see [[Karoubi envelope]].''

In [[mathematical analysis]], a [[metric space]] ''M'' is said to be '''complete''' (or '''Cauchy''') if every [[Cauchy sequence]] of points in ''M'' has a [[limit (topology)|limit]] that is also in ''M''.

Intuitively, a space is complete if it &quot;doesn't have any holes&quot;, if there aren't any &quot;points missing&quot;.
For instance, the [[rational number]]s are not complete, because &amp;radic;2 is &quot;missing&quot; even though you can construct a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers that converge to it. (See the examples below.)  It is always possible to &quot;fill all the holes&quot;, leading to the ''completion'' of a given space, as will be explained below.

== Examples ==

The space '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s, with the standard metric given by the [[absolute value]], is not complete.  Consider for instance the sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; := 1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; := ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/2 + 1/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
This is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, but it does not converge towards any rational limit; in fact, it converges towards the [[irrational number]] &amp;radic;2, the [[square root]] of [[two]].

The [[interval (mathematics)|open interval]] (0,1), again with the absolute value metric, is not complete either.
The sequence (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ...) is Cauchy, but does not have a limit in the space.
However the closed interval [0,1] is complete; the sequence above has the limit 0 in this interval.

The space '''R''' of [[real number]]s and the space '''C''' of [[complex number]]s (with the metric given by the absolute value) are complete, and so is [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
Other [[normed vector space]]s may or may not be complete; those which are, are the [[Banach space]]s.

The space '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s are complete for any [[prime number]] ''p''.
This space completes '''Q''' with the ''p''-adic metric in the same way that '''R''' completes '''Q''' with the usual metric.

If ''S'' is an arbitrary set, then the set ''S''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[sequence]]s in ''S'' becomes a complete metric space if we define the distance between the sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) to be 1/''N'', where ''N'' is the smallest index for which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[distinct]] from ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, or 0 if there is no such index.
This space is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of a [[countable]] number of copies of the [[discrete space]] ''S''.

== Some theorems ==

Every [[compact space|compact]] metric space is complete.
In fact, a metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and [[totally bounded]].

A subspace of a complete space is complete if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]].

If ''X'' is a [[set]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set B(''X'',''M'') of all [[bounded function]]s ''f'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a complete metric space.
Here we define the distance in B(''X'',''M'') in terms of the distance in ''M'' as

:&lt;math&gt;d(f,g) := \sup\left\{\,d(f(x),g(x)) : x\in X \,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''M'') consisting of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] bounded functions ''f'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a closed subspace of B(''X'',''M'') and hence also complete.

The [[Baire category theorem]] says that every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].
That is, the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] [[nowhere dense]] subsets of the space is [[empty set|empty]].

== Completion ==

For any metric space ''M'', one can construct a complete metric space ''M''' (which is also denoted as ''M'' with a bar over it), which contains ''M'' as a [[dense subspace]].
It has the following [[universal property]]: if ''N'' is any complete metric space and ''f'' is any [[uniformly continuous function]] from ''M'' to ''N'', then there exists a [[unique]] uniformly continuous function ''f' '' from ''M' '' to ''N'' which extends ''f''.
The space ''M''' is determined [[up to]] [[isometry]] by this property, and is called the ''completion'' of ''M''.

The completion of ''M'' can be constructed as a set of [[equivalence class]]es of Cauchy sequences in ''M''.
For any two Cauchy sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''M'', we may define their distance as
: d(''x'',''y'') = lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; d(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
(This limit exists because the real numbers are complete.)
This is only a [[pseudometric]], not yet a metric, since two different Cauchy sequences may have the distance 0.
But &quot;having distance 0&quot; is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all Cauchy sequences, and the set of equivalence classes is a metric space, the completion of ''M''.  The original space is embedded in this space via the identification of an element ''x'' of ''M'' with the equivalence class of sequences converging to ''x'' (i.e. the equivalence class containing the sequence with constant value ''x'').  This defines an [[isometry]] onto a dense subspace, as required.

[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s construction of the real numbers is a special case of this; the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers using the ordinary absolute value to measure distances.
By using different notions of distance on the rationals, one obtains different incomplete metric spaces whose completions are the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s.

If this completion procedure is applied to a [[normed vector space]], one obtains a [[Banach space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace, and if it is applied to an [[inner product space]], one obtains a [[Hilbert space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace.

== Topologically complete spaces ==

Note that completeness is a property of the ''metric'' and not of the ''[[topology]]'', meaning that a complete metric space can be [[homeomorphic]] to a non-complete one.
An example is given by the real numbers, which are complete but homeomorphic to the open interval (0,1), which is not complete.
Another example is given by the [[irrational number]]s, which are not complete as a subspace of the real numbers but are homeomorphic to '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; (a special case of an example in ''Examples'' above).

In [[topology]] one considers ''topologically complete'' (or ''completely metrizable'') spaces, spaces for which there exists at least one complete metric inducing the given topology.
Completely metrizable spaces can be characterized as those spaces which can be written as an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of countably many open subsets of some complete metric space.
Since the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]] is purely topological, it applies to these spaces as well.

== Generalizations ==

It is also possible to define the concept of completeness for [[uniform space]]s using Cauchy ''[[net (topology)|net]]s'' instead of Cauchy ''sequences''.
If every Cauchy net has a limit in ''X'', then ''X'' is called complete.
One can also construct a completion for an arbitrary uniform space similar to the completion of metric spaces.
The most general situation in which Cauchy nets apply is [[Cauchy space]]s; these too have a notion of completeness and completion just like uniform spaces.

A topological space may be completely [[uniformisable]] without being completely [[metrisable]]; it is then still not topologically complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Criswell.gif|right|frame|American psychic The Amazing Criswell, infamous for his eccentric predictions and appearances in the films of [[Ed Wood]], rising from his signature coffin.]]
'''Jeron Criswell King''' ([[August 18]], [[1907]] – [[October 4]], [[1982]]) born '''Jeron Criswell Konig''', and known by his stage-name '''The Amazing Criswell''', was an [[United States of America|American]] [[parapsychology|psychic]] who was famous for his wildly inaccurate predictions.  Criswell was born with the last name of Konig but later changed it to King and often represented it as his middle name, frequently credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.

Criswell found cinematic infamy in the movies of [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]], including ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' and ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]''. He was portrayed in the [[biopic]] ''[[Ed Wood (movie)|Ed Wood]]'' by [[Jeffrey Jones]], in which it is suggested that Criswell was simply a showman and never claimed to be a real psychic. However, those who knew him, such as actress and fellow ''Plan 9'' alumna [[Maila Nurmi]] (Vampira), have disputed this. According to writer Charles A. Coulombe, whose family rented an apartment from the psychic, Criswell had told Coulombe's father that he &quot;had the gift, but … lost it when I started taking money for it.&quot;

Criswell was a flamboyant figure, best remembered for his spitcurled hair, his stentorian speaking style, and his sequined tuxedo. He was the possessor of a [[coffin]], in which he claimed to sleep, and which found its way into a later Ed Wood film, the pornographic ''[[Necromania]]'' from [[1971]].

== Predictions ==
[[Image:Criswellpredicts.jpg|right|frame|Criswell's 1968 book ''Criswell Predicts''.]]
Criswell's predictions were nationally syndicated. Additionally, the psychic appeared on the television show ''Criswell Predicts'' on KLAC Channel 13 in Los Angeles, as well as being kinescoped for syndication on other television stations. Criswell's announcer, Bob Shields, would eventually be the judge on ''Divorce Court.'' Criswell was notorious for wearing his heavy pancake makeup outside the studio.

Criswell authored several books of predictions, including [[1968]]'s ''Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.'' In this book, the author claimed that [[Denver]] would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of [[rubber]], leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks. He also predicted an outbreak of mass [[cannibalism]] and the [[end of the world]], which he set as happening on [[August 18]], [[1999]].

Criswell's most famous prediction was made on American television in March [[1963]], when he predicted that [[John F. Kennedy]] would not run for reelection in [[1964]] because [[John F. Kennedy assassination|something]] was going to happen to him in November 1963.

== Private Life ==
Criswell was married to a former [[speakeasy]] dancer named [[Halo Meadows]], who once appeared on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', and who Coulombe describes as &quot;quite mad&quot;: &quot;Mrs. Criswell had a huge standard [[poodle]] (named 'Buttercup') which she was convinced was the [[reincarnation]] of her cousin Thomas. She spent a great deal of time [[sunbathing]] … which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight.&quot;

Criswell was longtime friends with actress [[Mae West]], once predicting her impending rise to the position of President of the United States, whereupon she, Criswell, and showman [[Liberace]] would ride a rocket to the moon. West used Criswell as her personal psychic, as well as lavishing him with gifts of homecooked food, dropped off via chauffeur. The food was often then eaten by Criswell and Nurmi, who refused any direct contact with West after a many-decade-old unpleasant experience with the film actress. Additionally, West was known to sell Criswell her old luxury cars for $5. For her [[1955]] album ''The Fabulous Mae West,'' she recorded a song about the psychic, titled, appropriately enough, &quot;Criswell Predicts.&quot;

Criswell was reputedly [[homosexuality|homosexual]], and was a habitué of The Gold Cup, a defunct [[Los Angeles]] coffee shop at the corner of Las Palmas and [[Hollywood Boulevard]] that served as an informal meeting place for homosexual encounters.

==Quotes==

A '''chain reaction''' is a sequence of [[reaction]]s where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions.


* The [[neutron]]-[[nuclear fission|fission]] chain reaction: a neutron plus a fissionable [[atom]] causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than was consumed in the initial reaction.
*[[Chemical reaction]]s, where a product of a reaction is itself a reactive particle which can cause more similar reactions. For example, every step of  [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] chain reaction consumes one [[molecule]] of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, one [[free radical]] H· or Cl· producing one [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] molecule and another free radical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chu Mei-feng''', (&amp;#29865;&amp;#32654;&amp;#40179; [[pinyin]]: Qú M&amp;#283;ifèng) born [[1966]], [[Republic of China|Taiwanese]] politician, was director of [[Hsinchu]]'s Bureau of Cultural Affairs.  She is noted for her outspokenness, sharp-wittedness, and beauty.

Chu campaigned under the [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] (NP) for election to the [[Legislative Yuan]]'s [[Taichung City]] electoral district and was seen as a threat to the incumbent [[Shen Chih-hui]], despite a string of high-profile relationships including one with Hsinchu's mayor, [[Tsai Jen-chien]], who was ten years older than she and a member of the rival [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP).

On [[December 17]], [[2001]], the [[tabloid]] &lt;cite&gt;Scoop Weekly&lt;/cite&gt; published a lengthy story about Chu's alleged [[promiscuity]] and distributed a video taken secretly with a pinhole camera, purportedly showing Chu having sex with a married man.  The video was sold on [[Video CD]]s in [[Hong Kong]] and Taiwan.  Chu sued the tabloid for [[libel]] on [[December 31]], 2001.  The magazines in question were pulled from the market as a result, but not before several thousand copies were sold. The video found its way onto the Internet.

      <comment>/* Etymology */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses2|Caddy}}

In [[golf]],  a '''caddy''' (or '''caddie''') is the person who carries a player's bag, and gives insightful advice and moral support. A caddy is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the golf course being played, along with the best strategy in playing it. This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection.

== Etymology ==
The records are not certain, but historians believe that [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]], came up with the term &quot;'''caddy'''&quot; in the late 16th century.  Mary grew up in [[France]] where military cadets carried golf clubs for royalty.  It is possible that Mary brought the custom to [[Scotland]], where the term evolved into the word &quot;caddy.&quot;

Alternatively, the word &quot;'''caddy'''&quot; may have originated from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word 'kati'. Kati is a measure for tea leaves and is printed on boxes used to carry and collect the tea leaves, hence its use in terms reflecting carrying and collecting.

Also, the word may have originated from the Welsh term &quot;cad&quot;, which is a &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;contest&quot;, or &quot;test&quot;, such as the [[Cad Goddeau]].

== Types of caddying ==
'''Traditional caddying''' involves both the ''golfer'' and the ''caddy'' walking the course.  The caddy is in charge of carrying the player’s bag and both the caddy and the golfer walk at the same pace.  This is the most common method used in [[golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] and is the only method allowed in the [[Professional Golfers' Association|PGA (Professional Golf Association)]] and [[LPGA|LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association)]].

'''Fore-caddying''' is a type of caddying where the caddy is always ahead of the golfer, marking their ''shots'' where they land.  The caddy will start out a ''hole'' by running to the landing spot of their golfer’s tee shot.  The job of the caddy is to ''mark'' the ''ball'' with a ''towel'', ''stick'', ''etc.'' so that the golfer does not have to waste time searching for it.  If the hole is long and requires multiple shots before the golfer can reach the &quot;green&quot; (the putting surface at the end of each hole), then the fore-caddy will go ahead to the next landing area and mark his/her golfer’s ball until the ball reaches the green.  Once the golfer is on the green, the ''fore-caddy'' maintains regular caddy duties like raking sand traps and taking the pin out of the cup.  After the golfer is finished putting on the green, the ''fore-caddy'' returns to his/her duties and heads out to the next hole’s landing spot.  This routine continues for the remainder of the course.  The main purpose of this type of caddying is to let the golfers ride in ''carts'' if they are unable to walk the course with a caddy.

'''Cart-caddying''', a type of ''fore-caddying'', consists of a caddy driving a cart for the entire round of golf.  The main job of the caddy is to drive ahead of the walking golfer and ''mark'' their ball before they get there.  Getting to the ball first, the caddy can determine what type of shot the golfer should play.  

== Duties ==
The caddy's duties include ''carrying the bag, reading greens, raking [[bunkers]], giving correct yardage, helping with club selection, cleaning clubs and golf balls, replacing “divots” (chunks of grass), pulling the pin, knowing the conditions of the course, and providing pleasant company''.  Caddies must also be alert at all times.  Any penalty caused by the caddy is added on to his/her golfer’s ''score''.  The caddy should be aware of their surroundings at all times, especially when players are hitting.  Standing in other golfers’ ''line of putting or line of sight'' while they are hitting a ball is discouraged.  Also, during ''tournaments'' the caddy is expected to know the rules and point out any rule-breaking on the part of the golfer.  The caddy is responsible for knowing the ''maximum club limit'' allowed.  A caddy on the [[PGA Tour]], Miles Byrne, became famous when he forgot to count the clubs in [[Ian Woosnam]]'s bag (only 14 allowed) before the final round of the [[British Open]]. His mistake cost Woosnam two strokes and possibly the championship.  Duties performed by the caddy can directly affect the play of the golfer.  

== Relationship between the caddy and the golfer ==
The caddy and the golfer spend hours at a time together, which allows them to develop a ''relationship''.  One of the caddy’s jobs is to support the player mentally to help them golf a better round.  &quot;Small talk&quot; is one of the ways that the caddy and the golfer can get to know each other.  Most of the time, the golfer initiates the conversation by asking the caddy personal questions to get to know them and build a rapport.  ''Questions'' brought up may include where the caddy lives, where they go to school, professional aspirations, and the size of their family.  The golfer usually proceeds to tell the caddy about himself, forming a relationship for the duration of the round.  A seasoned caddy becomes pretty adept at reading the players he is working for and knowing if they prefer to receive advice during their rounds of golf or whether they prefer to be left alone and make decisions on their own.

== Weekly schedule ==
The weekly schedule for a caddy consists of working one to six days.  The most caddied days are Saturdays and Sundays when golfers have off work.  Caddies that are dedicated will work up to the maximum six days a week.  The number of days worked is limited to when the course is open.  Usually the course is closed one day out of the week (typically Monday).   This allows for the “greenskeeper”, or person in charge of keeping the course up to playing standards, to maintain the course; mowing and doing repairs where is needed.  At some courses, caddies are allowed to golf the day the course is closed.

== Pay scale ==
Caddies are paid at the end of the round by cash or with a ticket that can be cashed by the club.  Depending on how good the caddy is, there is a minimum ''base pay'' that is enforced by the club: the better the caddy, the higher the base pay.  In some countries, including the United States, the golfer is also expected to tip, based on how the caddy performed.  In the United States base pay can range anywhere from 15 dollars to 75 dollars, and tips can be nonexistent or up to a couple hundred percent of the base.  However, on average, a caddy at a local golf club or country club in the U.S. will earn forty to sixty dollars for a day’s work.

== Attire ==
*Collared shirt
*Khaki shorts or pants 
*Gym shoes (lots of walking and standing)
*Smock
*Towel

== Alternative names for a caddy ==
*Bagger
*Bag-toter
*Jock
*Looper
*Lugger
*Noonan

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''compound turbine''' is a [[turbine]] in which there are two casings, a high-[[pressure]] casing and a low-pressure casing, operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam. The steam is partially expanded in the high-pressure casing, then exhausted to the low-pressure casing. The rotor arrangement can be either tandem-compound in which the two axels are joined end to end, or cross-compound in which the two turbines have separate axels. In the cross-compound case two separate [[generator (device)|generator]]s must usually be supplied.

The principal advantages of compound turbines are the reduction in size of any one casing, the confinement of the highest pressure to the smaller casing (which may be made of stronger and more expensive materials) and the possibility of divided flow in the low-pressure casing for the purpose of equalizing end thrusts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otheruses4|the astronomical term|other uses|Corona (disambiguation)}}

In astronomy, a '''corona''' is the luminous [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] &quot;[[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]]&quot; of the [[Sun]] or other celestial body, extending millions of [[kilometre]]s into space, most easily seen during a total [[solar eclipse]], but also observable in a [[coronagraph]].
[[Image:Solar_eclips_1999_4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photo taken during the [[France|French]] [[1999]] eclipse]]

==Physical features==
The Sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor of nearly 200) than the visible surface of the Sun: the [[photosphere]]'s average [[temperature]] is 5800 [[kelvin]]s compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt; as dense as the photosphere, however, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow [[chromosphere]]. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's [[magnetic field]] and [[sound|sonic]] pressure waves from below (the latter being less probable now that coronae are known to be present in early-type [[star]]s). The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being lost as [[solar wind]].

The Corona is not always evenly distributed across the surface of the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the [[equator]]ial regions, with &quot;coronal holes&quot; covering the [[Geographical pole|polar]] regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with [[sunspot]] activity.

The high temperature of the corona gives it unusual [[spectroscopy|spectral]] features, which led some to suggest, in the [[19th century]], that it contained a previously unknown element, &quot;[[coronium]]&quot;; however these spectral features have since been traced to known elements in high states of ionization.

===Transients===
Generated by [[solar flare]]s or large [[solar prominence]]s, &quot;coronal transients&quot; are sometimes released. These are enormous loops of coronal material traveling outward from the Sun at over a million kilometres per hour, containing roughly 10 times the energy of the solar flare or prominence that triggered them.

==Other stars==
Stars other than the Sun have coronae, which can be detected using [[X-ray]] [[telescope]]s. Some stellar coronae, particularly in young stars, are much more luminous than the Sun's.

== Coronal heating problem ==
The '''coronal heating problem''' in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] relates to the question of why the temperature of the Sun's corona is millions of kelvins higher than that of the surface. The high temperatures require energy to be carried from the solar interior to the corona by non-thermal processes, because the [[second law of thermodynamics]] prevents heat from flowing directly from the solar photosphere, or surface, at about 5800 kelvins, to the much hotter corona at about 1 to 3 [[SI prefix|MK]] (parts of the corona can even reach 10 MK). The amount of power required to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square metre of surface area on the Sun, or 1/40,000 of the amount of light energy that escapes the Sun.

Two separate theories have emerged to explain why the corona is so hot, ''wave heating'' and ''magnetic reconnection''. Through most of the past 50 years, neither theory has been able to account for the coronal heat. Most [[solar physicists]] now believe that some combination of the two theories can probably explain coronal heating, although the details are not yet complete.

===Wave heating theory===
The ''wave heating'' theory, proposed in [[1949]] by [[Evry Schatzman]], proposes that waves carry energy from the solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of [[Plasma physics|plasma]] rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to [[sound waves]] in air. The most important types of wave are [[magneto-acoustic wave]]s and [[Alfvén wave]]s. Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified by the presence of a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves, are similar to [[ULF]] [[radio waves]] that have been modified by interaction with [[matter]] in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of [[granulation]] and [[supergranulation]] at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into [[shock waves]] that dissipate their energy as heat.

One problem with wave heating is delivery of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and because they tend to be [[reflected]] back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by [[Thomas Bogdan]] and colleagues in [[2003]], seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes at the base of the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere into the corona and then dissipate it as heat.

Another problem with wave heating has been the complete absence, until the late [[1990s]], of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in [[1997]] with the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the [[ultraviolet|extreme ultraviolet]] for long periods of time with stable [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 [[hertz|millihertz]] (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.

It is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona. Results published in [[2004]] using data from the [[TRACE]] spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different [[ions]] in the solar wind with the [[UVCS]] instrument aboard SOHO give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200 Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from [[Williams College]] suggest the presences of such waves in the 1-10 Hz range.

===Magnetic reconnection theory===
The [[Magnetic reconnection]] theory relies on the solar magnetic field to induce electric currents in the solar corona. The currents then collapse suddenly, releasing energy as heat and wave energy in the corona. This process is called &quot;reconnection&quot; because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in a plasma (or any electrically conductive fluid such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[seawater]]). In a plasma, [[magnetic field lines]] are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the [[topology]] of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south [[magnetic pole]] are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to &quot;reconnect&quot; to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.

[[Magnetic reconnection]] is known to be the mechanism behind solar flares, the largest explosions in our solar system. Furthermore, the surface of the Sun is covered with millions of small magnetized regions 50-1,000 km across. These small magnetic poles are buffeted and churned by the constant granulation. The magnetic field in the solar corona must undergo nearly constant reconnection to match the motion of this &quot;magnetic carpet&quot;, so the energy released by the reconnection is a natural candidate for the coronal heat, perhaps as a series of &quot;microflares&quot; that individually provide very little energy but together account for the required energy.

The idea that microflares might heat the corona was put forward by [[Eugene Parker]] in the [[1980s]] but is still controversial. In particular, [[ultraviolet]] telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light, but there seem to be too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the TRACE data. Variations on the microflare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in [[2005]].

'''''Chrono Cross''''' (クロノ・クロス ''Kurono Kurosu'') is a [[PlayStation]] [[Computer role-playing game|RPG]] created by [[Square Co., Ltd.]] (now [[Square Enix]]) with a story that builds upon ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''. However, ''Chrono Trigger'' team members [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] (Supervisor), [[Yuji Horii]] (Supervisor, Initial Scenario Writer), and [[Akira Toriyama]] (Character Design) were not a part of the ''Chrono Cross'' development team, and their absence is very noticeable. Indeed, few of the original staff participated on the game as they had been reassigned to different teams over the years. 

In [[1996]], ''Chrono Trigger'' had a [[side story]] released in [[Japan]] called ''[[Radical Dreamers]]'' for the [[Satellaview]] add-on for the [[Super Famicom]] (SNES), but was an illustrated [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]]. When ''Chrono Cross'' was being designed, parts of the plot and characters of ''Radical Dreamers'' were used. However, ''Chrono Cross'' cannot be viewed as a mere remake of ''Radical Dreamers'' as they have a lot of differences and incompatibilities.

''Chrono Cross'' was released in [[United States]] in [[2000]] and features music composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]. The game was hailed by professional reviewers, but some ''Chrono Trigger'' fans denounced it as an inferior sequel. In some cases, this is a result of these players wanting to control the old cast of ''Chrono Cross''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s predecessor and play a more direct sequel. ''Chrono Cross'' sold to expectations in the [[United States]], but disappointing Japanese sales lead some to speculate that the ''Chrono'' series has been halted.

Like the majority of [[Square Co., Ltd.|Square]] productions, ''Chrono Cross'' has yet to be granted an official [[European]] release. Square has cited a combination of economic and technical expenses involved with formatting the game for PAL territories as the reason behind not converting this game for release in Europe.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
The story of ''Chrono Cross'' revolves around the character Serge, the protagonist, who, as a small child, is supposed to drown, but is saved by a powerful force. The resulting shift in the world's history creates two distinct parallel [[dimension]]s. In one dimension, he survives and lives for 10 years before the game begins. In the [[alternate dimension]], he drowns in a beach near his home.

The plot itself revolves around Serge's unknowing efforts to free [[Schala]] from the Time Devourer: a fusion of [[Lavos]], the ultimate enemy from ''Chrono Trigger'' with the capacity to destroy the planet, and [[Schala]], a princess of Zeal and sister of [[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]] with immense magical power who has disappeared into the Darkness Beyond Time due to an accident. Years in the future, Belthasar, a former guru of Zeal, discovered that the Time Devourer had formed and planned to consume all spacetime; he thus set in motion an almost ludicrously complex chain of events meant to give rise to and guide Serge to venture to the Time Devourer and use an artifact known as the ''Chrono Cross'' to restore the dimensions to one and free Schala from Lavos's grasp. While the plot is sound, its delivery is criticized by some as excessively complex. Unlike ''Chrono Trigger'', in which the basic plot is simple and straight-forward, much of the dialogue throughout the game of ''Chrono Cross'' must be read carefully in order to make sense of the story. Because some ''Chrono Cross'' players do not listen to much of the game's characters, they mistakenly accuse the plot of being weak and senseless. Thus, many players resort to guides, such as the following link, to understand the story's intricacies. [http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Cross_Condensed_Plot_Summary]

While ''Chrono Cross'' incorporates elements from ''Radical Dreamers'', the stories of the two games are incompatible. To resolve the scenario continuity issue and to acknowledge the existence of ''Radical Dreamers'', the designers suggested that the events of Radical Dreamers did happen, but took place in a parallel [[dimension]]. This can be found by reading one of the computer consoles in Chronopolis, a city which was pulled back in time due to a failed experiment. Chronopolis now monitors the El Nido Archipelago, in an attempt to prevent a paradox from occurring which would prevent its existence in the future. The most notable difference is that Magus is absent from the game. While confirmed to be Magil in Radical Dreamers by both the game and its creator, Magus does not assume the identity Guile in ''Chrono Cross'', as is commonly assumed. It was noted in an interview that the developers originally planned for Magus to be in the game, but scrapped the idea due to difficulties representing his story amongst forty-three other characters.

[[Image:Chrono-Cross-title-screen.jpg|right|220px|thumb|''Chrono Cross'' title screen]]

==Characters==
There are 44 characters normally (Lynx unlockable through an odd twist in the gameplay), with six Elements for each of them. While the presence of six elements is a departure from ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s limit at four, the game does provide an explanation for the change — that ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s magic was the manipulating of the basic four fundamental properties of the universe, and ''Chrono Cross''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s magic is the use of manufactured tools to effect changes in nature.

The game has 45 possible party members to acquire, all of whom come with several abilities of their own, with some combining into Double and Triple Techs.

Because of the incredibly vast number of possible party combinations, the North American version of the game contains a system to modify base text for each character's accent. Whereas other games would need to program different blocks of text for each character, this game uses the same text and modifies it based on the character using it. This was done so that a North American localization would be possible.

An example of its coding in the script:

Member Name:&lt;br&gt;
l.et's2 .go.suffixe, Serge..&lt;br&gt;
the w.ater1 .Dr3agon .mus1t .be.&lt;br&gt;
be.yondth1is1 .point...

===White innate characters===
White is a more mystical element than others, encompassing light, holiness, and healing. One of the characters with a White element is a religious person. White innate characters have access to the most powerful healing spells in the game. White corresponds to ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Lightning&quot; element, which was actually known as &quot;Heaven&quot; in the original Japanese version of the game. (Heaven included lightning spells because lightning comes down from the heavens.) It was renamed Lightning in the English localization due to [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]'s strictly enforced policy which demanded that any and all religious references be omitted from North American versions of games.  Note that the character Pip is capable of evolving and, in doing so, changing his element.

===Black innate characters===
Black is a darker element than others. Two of the characters with a Black element are undead or spirits. Great with offensive magic. This roughly corresponds to the &quot;Shadow&quot; element from ''Chrono Trigger''.

*[[Image:Serge as Lynx portrait (Chrono Cross).png|16px]] [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]] (Swallow) (Male)

*[[Image:Grobyc portrait.png|16px]] [[Grobyc]] (Glove) (Male)

===Red innate characters===
Red innate characters have a high focus on power. Many of the Red characters are some of the most powerful. Naturally, red is the element of fire and lava. In ''Chrono Trigger'', it was simply called, &quot;Fire&quot;.

*[[Kid (Chrono Cross)|Kid]] (Dagger) (Female)
*[[Greco (Chrono Cross)|Greco]] (Glove) (Male)
*[[Image:Draggy portrait.png|16px|Draggy]] [[Draggy]] (Glove) (Male)
*[[Miki (Chrono Cross)|Miki]] (Glove) (Female)
*[[Orcha]] (Utensils) (Male)
*[[Macha (Chrono Cross)|Macha]] (Utensils) (Female)
*[[Zappa (Chrono Cross)|Zappa]] (Axe/Hammer) (Male)
*[[Janice (Chrono Cross)|Janice]] (Carrot) (Female)

===Blue innate characters===
Blue innate characters are good healers and offensive magic users. Leena is one of the best healers. Blue is the element of water and ice. This matches ''Chrono Trigger'', in which [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]] uses ice magic but as labeled &quot;Water&quot; like Frog.

*[[Orlha]] (Glove) (Female)
*[[Marcy (Chrono Cross)|Marcy]] (Glove) (Female)
*[[Fargo (Chrono Cross)|Fargo]] (Sword) (Male)
*[[Pierre (Chrono Cross)|Pierre]] (Sword) (Male)
*[[Nikki]] (Pick) (Male)
*[[Irenes]] (Pick) (Female)
*[[Leena]] (Utensils) (Female)
*[[Korcha]] (Lure) (Male)

===Green innate characters===
Green innate characters are good healers as well as good offensive magic users, like Razzly, and also good with physical attacks, like Glenn and Karsh. Green is the element of air and nature. It has no equivalent in ''Chrono Trigger''.

*[[Glenn (Chrono Cross)|Glenn]] (Sword) (Male)
*[[Image:Turnip portrait-Chrono Cross.png|16px|Turnip]] [[Turnip (Chrono Cross)|Turnip]] (Sword) (Male)
*[[Sprigg]] (Staff) (Female)
*[[Radius (Chrono Cross)|Radius]] (Staff) (Male)
*[[Image:NeoFio portrait.png|16px|NioFio]] [[NeoFio]] (Glove) (Female)
*[[Razzly]] (Rod) (Female)
*[[Karsh]] (Axe) (Male)
*[[Van (Chrono Cross)|Van]] (Boomerang) (Male)

===Yellow innate characters===
Great offensive fighters. Some of the most powerful characters, especially Leah. Yellow magic is rooted in electricity and earth. However, it does not correspond with any element in ''Chrono Trigger''; ''Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Lightning element is merely an invention of its localization team (the original element being Heaven).

*[[Zoah]] (Glove) (Male)
*[[Image:Poshul portrait.png|16px|Poshul]] [[Poshul]] (Glove) (Female)
*[[Leah (Chrono Cross)|Leah]] (Axe) (Female)
*[[Image:Funguy portrait.png|16px|Funguy]] [[Funguy]] (Axe) (Male)
*[[Norris (Chrono Cross)|Norris]] (Gun) (Male)
*[[Sneff]] (Shot) (Male)
*[[General Viper]] (Sword) (Male)
*[[Mel (Chrono Cross)|Mel]] (Boomerang) (Female)

===Returning characters===
Six characters from ''Chrono Trigger'' return in the sequel. These characters, however, are [[non-player character|not playable]] and only make brief appearances, though some fans have speculated that some of the game's player characters are in fact ''Chrono Trigger'' characters (especially Magus) going by another name.

*[[Crono]] - Crono appears as a spirit on two different occasions; once in the Dead Sea, and again near the portal to [[Lavos]].

*[[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]] - Marle appears as a spirit on three different occasions; once while the party enters the Hydra Marshes, again in the Dead Sea, and last near the portal to Lavos.

*[[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]] - Lucca appears in more than one form. She first appears in the Dead Sea, as the spirit of a child. Later, when you're in Kid's memory, you will see her for a brief instance as Lynx takes her away, to assist him in his plans. She once again appears as a spirit, near the portal to [[Lavos]].

*[[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]] - Robo appears in Chronopolis, under the name Prometheus. He is used to keep FATE locked up, and after talking to Serge and company, he is executed by FATE.

*[[Magus (Chrono Trigger)|Magus]] - In a letter sent by Lucca, she says to Kid that Janus may be watching over her, and &quot;if so, hello, Janus!&quot; Some claim that he was in the room, based on a human-shaped shadow that appears when the letter is being read.

*[[Lavos]] - Lavos returns as the main villain of the game, but never appears until the very end of the game. While Serge and company believed that breaking FATE's seal on the Dragons was a good idea, it turned out that they were not the Dragons they had once been, their original united form having been assimilated by Lavos' Devourer of Time form. As the Time Devourer, Lavos had Schala attached to him, this being due to Lavos' existence being cast into the Darkness Beyond Time -- where Schala had previously been banished by Lavos -- once Chrono and his friends from ''Chrono Trigger'' defeated him.

*[[Ozzie, Slash, and Flea]] - Appearing in a hidden boss fight, the three have no bearing on the plot. [[Sprigg]] can learn to transform into any member of the trio. As Slash, she can perform the &quot;Z Slash&quot; triple tech when teamed with Fargo and Glenn.

===Character relationships===
It is revealed at many points different relationships between playable and non-playable characters. Here's a list of relationships.
* Serge - Boyfriend of Leena, Son of Lynx, Future Husband of Kid/Schala[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_%28Chrono_Cross%29#Connection_Serge_and_Magus_.28Janus_Zeal.29]

* Riddel - Daughter of General Viper, Fiancee of Dario
* Lynx - Father of Serge
* Wazuki - Original identity of Serge's father
* Miguel - Friend of Wazuki, father of Leena
* Guile - None (was going to be Magus, Schala's brother, but his backstory was dropped due to complications)
* Luccia - Friend of Lucca
* Kid - Daughter-clone of Schala, raised by Lucca, future wife of Serge[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_%28Chrono_Cross%29#Connection_Serge_and_Magus_.28Janus_Zeal.29]
* Miki - Lead dancer for Nikki's show

* Mel - Daughter of Macha, Sister of Korcha
* Garai - Father of Glenn and Dario, Wielder of Einlanzer, Friend of Radius
* Dario - Brother of Glenn, Son of Garai, Wielder of Masamune

==Music==
A three-[[CD]] official soundtrack was released soon after the game, and eventually sold out. [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] noted in the OST's liner notes that he was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned in terms of transferring his ideas to the Playstation's sound capabilities. He also named several influences in the liner notes, including a Mediterranean theme, [[Fado]] music, African percussion and old music from several cultures — most notably Celtic. After ''Chrono Cross'' was completed, Mitsuda personally undertook a playthrough to observe how the tracks matched up to their correspondent scenes and settings in the game.

Though the ''Chrono Cross'' OST sold out a year or two after its release, SquareEnix recently reissued it due to popular demand. Currently, the only legitimate way to purchase the soundtrack is through Amazon Japan [http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009J8HB6/procyonstudio-22]. Amazon Japan will gladly ship overseas and does feature English support for its pages.

==Awards/Ratings==
This is a list of various awards and overall ratings that the game has so far received.

* [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] - Gold Award

Also, [[GameSpot]] has reviewed over 1100+ games and has only given 4 of them a perfect 10/10.
''Chrono Cross'' is one of them.

* [http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/chronocross/index.html?q=chrono+cross GameSpot considers ''Chrono Cross'' to be perfect in every manner.]

As of January 2006, [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/g/playstation/chrono_cross/ Rottentomatoes.com] gives a rating of 92% for ''Chrono Cross'', [http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/196917.asp Gamerankings.com] provides a rating of 93%, and the fan ratings on GameSpot averages to 9.3/10.

==&quot;Chrono Break&quot;==
Square applied for a trademark for the name ''[[Chrono Break]]'' in the U.S., late 2001, resulting in speculation by fans of the possibility of a sequel. However, the trademark was dropped in the [[United States]] on [[November 13]], [[2003]], confirmed by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. The trademark still stands in Japan, where it was registered as ''Chrono Brake''. It is suspected that the project had been planned at one point (with one of the original ''Chrono Trigger'' project leads at the helm, and not the ''Chrono Cross''/''[[Xenogears]]''/''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' staff), but cancelled before production could begin. Focus on other games such as the Final Fantasy series may have also contributed to Square's abandonment of this title.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''planned economy''' is an [[economic system]] in which decisions about the production, allocation and consumption of goods and services is planned ahead of time, in either a centralized or decentralized fashion. Since most known planned economies rely on plans implemented by the way of command, they have become widely known as '''command economies'''. Any economic system that is centrally-planned by a government is commonly referred to as economic [[statism]]. To stress the usual centralized character of planned economies and to contrast the term with decentralized planning such as in a [[participatory economy]], the more specific term, '''centrally planned economy''', is often used. This article primarily deals with centrally planned economies.

== Support for centrally planned economies ==

Supporters of planned economies cast them as a practical measure to ensure the production of necessary goods&amp;#8212;one which does not rely on the vagaries of [[free market|free markets]].

*The government can harness land, labor, and capital to serve the economic objectives of the state (which, in turn, may be decided by the people through a [[democracy|democratic]] process). Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. The state can begin building a heavy industry at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. 
*A planned economy can maximize the continuous utilization of all available resources.  This means that planned economies do not suffer from a [[business cycle]]. Under a planned economy, neither unemployment nor idle production facilities should exist beyond minimal levels, and the economy should develop in a stable manner, unimpeded by inflation or recession. 
*A planned economy can serve social rather than individual ends: under such a system, rewards, whether wages or perquisites, are to be distributed according to the social value of the service performed. A planned economy eliminates the dependence of production on individual profit motives, which may not in themselves provide for all society's needs.

Taken as a whole, a centrally planned economy would attempt to substitute a number of firms with a single firm for an entire economy.  As such, the stability of a planned economy has implications with the [[Theory of the firm]].  After all, most corporations are essentially 'centrally planned economies', aside from some token intra-corporate pricing (not to mention that the politics in some corporations resemble that of the Soviet Politburo).  That is, corporations are essentially miniature centrally planned economies and seem to do just fine in a free market.  As pointed out by Kenneth Arrow and others, the existence of firms in free markets shows that there is a need for firms in free markets; opponents of planned economies would simply argue that there is no need for a sole firm for the entire economy.

==Objections to centrally planned economies ==
Critics of command economy argue that planners cannot detect demand with sufficient accuracy (in a market economy, price signals serve this purpose). For example, during certain periods in the history of the [[Soviet Union]], shortages were so common that one could wait hours in a queue to buy basic consumer products such as shoes or bread. These shortages were due in part to  the central planners deciding, for example, that making tractors was more important than making shoes at that time, or because the commands were not given to supply the shoe factory with the right amount of leather, or because the central planners had not given the shoe factories the incentive to produce the required quantity of shoes of the required quality.  This difficulty was first noted by economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who called it the &quot;[[economic calculation problem]]&quot;. Economist [[János Kornai]] developed this into a [[shortage economy]] theory.

Critics also argue that the claimed advantages of the latter are in fact achievable by state intervention within the framework of market economy as well. In particular, it is possible to create unprofitable but socially useful goods within the context of a market economy.  For example, one could produce a new drug by having the government collect taxes and then spend the money for the social good. It is also claimed that market economies allow societies to evaluate the cost of social goods and choose rationally between different alternatives.

Critics also point out that certain types of command economies may require a state which intervenes highly in people's personal lives. For example, if the state directs all employment then one's career options may be more limited. If goods are allocated by the state rather than by a market economy, citizens cannot, for example, move to another location without state permission because they would not be able to acquire food or housing in the new location, since those were not preplanned for (however, advocates of planned economy may point out that a market economy does not guarantee the existence of food and housing at the new location either).

==Planned economies and socialism ==
''Main article: [[Socialist economics]]''

In the 20th century, most planned economies were implemented by states that called themselves [[socialism|socialist]]. Also, the greatest support for planned economics comes from socialist authors. For these reasons, the notion of a planned economy is often directly associated with socialism. However, they do not entirely overlap. There are branches of socialism such as [[libertarian socialism]], that reject a centralized state, and some of these tendencies reject economic planning as well.

Furthermore, planned economies are not unique to socialist states. Socialism is concerned above all with achieving some degree of equality of wealth between members of society, but a planned economy, as such, does not necessarily imply an egalitarian distribution of wealth. Some authors have argued that elements of centralized economic planning exist in various modern non-socialist systems, such as the [[mixed economy|mixed economies]] of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] (widely seen as being capitalist countries) and the economies of [[fascism|fascist]] nations. Pre-modern economies (those existing before the [[industrial revolution]]) are more difficult to analyze by today's standards, but a number of them, particularly those of [[hydraulic empire]]s, may be seen as having been centrally planned as well.

There is a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of the [[permanent arms economy]], put forward by [[Michael Kidron]], which leads on from the contention that war and accompanying [[industrialisation]] is a continuing feature of capitalist states and that central planning and other features of the [[war economy]] are ever present. {{ref|Kidron}}

==Transition from a planned economy to a market economy ==

The shift from a command economy to a market economy has proven to be difficult; in particular, there were no theoretical guides for doing so before the 1990s.  One transition from a command economy to a market economy that is widely considered to be successful is that of the [[People's Republic of China]], in which there was a period of some years lasting roughly until the early 1990s during which both the command economy and the market economy coexisted, so that nobody would be much worse off under a mixed economy than a command economy, while some people would be much better off.  Gradually, the parts of the economy under the command economy decreased until the mid-1990s when resource allocation was almost completely determined by market mechanisms.

By contrast, the [[Soviet Union]]'s transition was much more problematic and its [[successor republic]]s faced a sharp decline in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] during the early 1990s. While the situation has since improved, these countries have yet to generate the high rate of sustained economic growth that China has.

A [[palace economy]] may be considered as a [[subsistence economy]] augmented with elements of command economy.

The '''Common Chimpanzee''' (''Pan troglodytes''), also known as the '''Robust Chimpanzee''', is a [[Hominidae|great ape]]. Colloquially, it is often called the [[chimpanzee]] (or simply &quot;chimp&quot;), though technically this term refers to both [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'': the Common Chimpanzee and the closely-related [[Bonobo]], or Pygmy Chimpanzee.

Several subspecies of the Common Chimpanzee are been recognized:

* [[Central Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'', in [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]];
* [[West African Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes verus'', in [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], and [[Nigeria]];
* West Nigeria/East Cameroon or simply [[Nigerian Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes vellerosus'', in [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]];
* [[Eastern Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'', in the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]].

==Basic facts==
Common Chimpanzees are found in the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forests]] and wet [[Tropical_and_subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|savannas]] of Western and Central [[Africa]]. They used to inhabit most of this region, but their [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] has been dramatically reduced in recent years.

Adults in the wild weigh between 40 and 65 kg (88 and 143 lbs); males can measure up to 160 cm (63 inches) and females to 130 cm (51 inches), and both are much stronger than humans. Their bodies are covered by a coarse dark brown hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both their thumbs and their big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip. Their [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is 8 months. Infants are weaned when they are about 3 years old, but usually maintain a close relationship with their mother for several more years; they reach [[puberty]] at the age of 8-10, and their lifespan in captivity is about 50 years.

Although omnivores, their diet is mainly vegetarian, consisting of [[fruits]], [[leaves]], [[Nut (fruit) | nuts]], [[seeds]], [[tuber]]s, and miscellaneous plantlife supplemented by [[insect]]s and small prey. There are also instances of organized hunting; in some cases, such as the killing of [[leopard]] cubs, this seems to be primarily a protective effort. However, Common Chimpanzees sometimes band together and hunt [[Western Red Colobus|Western Red Colobus monkeys]] (''Piliocolobus badius'') for their meat. Isolated cases of [[cannibalism]] have been documented. Chimpanzees have also been known on rare occasions to attack and eat human infants.

[[Image:Apeclade.png|thumb|right|'''The ape clade'''. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans. The numbers in this diagram provide an estimate of relatedness based on similarities in proteins between the various apes.]]

==Social behavior==
Common Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time traveling in small parties of just a few individuals. They are both arboreal and terrestrial, spending equal time in the trees and on the ground. Their habitual gait is [[quadruped|quadrupedal]], using the soles of their feet and resting on their knuckles, but they can walk upright for short distances.

The Common Chimpanzee lives in a [[fission-fusion society]], where [[mating]] is promiscuous and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, bisexual, one female and her offspring, or a single individual. The core of the societies are males who roam around, protecting members of the group as well as engaging in the search for food. Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy. However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, &quot;in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest&quot;{{ref|goodall}}, is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within the fission-fusion society. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.   

As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger ''parent'' group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees who regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area). As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized in order to [[hunt]] for meat, while a bi-sexual group consisting of one mature male and one mature female may occur for the purposes of [[copulation]]. An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated.

==Chimpanzee Genome Project==
{{main|Chimpanzee Genome Project}}
[[Human]] and Common Chimpanzee [[DNA]] is very similar. After the completion of the [[Human genome project]], a Common [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]] was initiated. In December of 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes such as the forkhead-box P2 [[transcription factor]], which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on [[September 1]], [[2005]], in an article produced by the [[Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]]{{ref|genome}}. The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million [[Point mutation|single-nucleotide]] changes, five million [[Mutation#Structural classification|insertion/deletion]] events, and various [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[Chromosomal translocation|rearrangements]]. Typical human and chimp [[homolog]]s of [[protein]]s differ in only an average of two [[amino acid]]s. About 30 percent of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of [[chromosome]]s have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material, with about 2.7 percent of the genome now representing differences having been produced by gene duplications or deletions during approximately 6 million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from the human and chimp genome analyses should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases.

[[Image:Charcot-marie-tooth---foot.jpg|thumb|250px|The foot of a person with Charcot-Marie-Tooth. The lack of muscle, high arch, and hammer toes are signs of the genetic disease.]]
'''Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease''', also known as Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN) or Peroneal Muscular Atrophy, is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of [[nerve]]s ([[neuropathy]]) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease. Though presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, with 36 in 100,000 affected (Krajewski et al.,2000).

The disorder is caused by the absence of molecules that are essential for normal function of the nerves due to deficiencies in the structure of the genes coding these molecules. The absence of these chemical substances gives rise to dysfunction either in the [[axon]] or the [[myelin]] sheath of the nerve cell. 

The different classes of this disorder have been divided into the primary demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1, CMT3, and CMT4) and the primary axonal neuropathies (CMT2).  Recent studies, however, show that the the pathologies of these two classes are frequently intermingled, due to the dependence and close cellular interaction of Schwann cells and neurons.  Schwann cells are responsible for myelin formation, enwrapping neural axons with their plama membranes in a process called “myelination” (Berger et al., 2002).

The molecular structure of the nerve depends upon the interactions between neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts.  Schwann cells and neurons, in particular, exchange signals that regulate survival and differentiation during development.  These signals are important to CMT disease because a disturbed communication between Schwann cells and neurons, resulting from a genetic defect, is observed in this disorder (Berger et al., 2002).

It is clear that interaction with demyelinating Schwann cells causes the expression of abnormal axonal structure and function, but we still do not know how these abnormalities result in CMT.  One possibility is that the weakness and sensory loss experienced by patients with CMT is a result of axonal degradation.  Another possibility is that axonal dysfunction occurs, not degeneration, and that this dysfunction is induced by demyelinating Schwann cells (Krajewski et al., 2000).   

Most patients experience demyelinating neuropathies, and this is characterized by a reduction in nerve conduction velocity (NCV), due to a partial or complete loss of the myosin sheet.  Axonopathies, on the other hand, are characterized by a reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP), while NCV is normal or only slightly reduced (Berger et al.,2002).

The disease is named for those who classically described it: [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825-1893) and his pupil [[Pierre Marie]] (1853-1940)  (''&quot;Sur une forme particulière d'atrophie musculaire progressive, souvent familiale débutant par les pieds et les jambes et atteignant plus tard les mains&quot;'', Revue médicale, Paris, 1886; 6: 97-138.), and [[Howard Henry Tooth]] (1856-1925) (&quot;The peroneal type of progressive muscular atrophy&quot;, dissertation, London, 1886.)

==Symptoms==
Symptoms usually begin in late-childhood or early adulthood. Usually, the initial symptom is foot drop due to involvement of the peroneal nerve, which is responsible for raising the feet, early in the course of the disease. This can also cause hammer toe, where the toes are always curled. Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to &quot;stork leg&quot; appearance. Weakness in the Hands and forearms are greatly affected in many people later in life as the disease progresses. Symptoms and progression of the disease can vary. Breathing can be affected in some ,so can hearing, vision, the neck and shoulder muscles; scoliosis is common; hip sockets can be malformed; gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT, as can chewing, swallowing, speaking (as vocal cords atrophy); and a tremor can develop as muscles waste. Pregnancy has been known to exacerbate CMT as well as extreme emotional stress.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is established by [[electromyography]] examination (which shows that the velocity of nerve impulse conduction is decreased and the time required to charge the nerve is increased) and nerve [[biopsy]].  [[Genetic marker]]s have been identified for some, but not all forms of the disease.

==Types of the disease==
===CMT Type 1 (CMT1)===
Type 1 affects approximately 80% of CMT patients and is the most common type of CMT.  The subtypes share clinical symptoms.  [[Autosomal dominant]].  Causes demyelination, which can be detected by measuring nerve conduction velocities.
*'''CMT type 1A''' - '''CMT1A''' ({{OMIM|118220}}) - The most common form of the disease, caused by mutations in the PMP22 gene ([[locus]] 17p11.2).  70-80% of Type 1 patients.  Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 15-20[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 1B''' - '''CMT1B''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=118200 OMIM 118200]) - Caused by mutations in the MPZ gene (1q22) producing protein zero (P0). 5-10% of Type 1 patients. Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: &lt;20[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 1C''' - '''CMT1C''' - Sometimes called '''Dejerine-Sottas disease''' - Causes severe [[myelin|demyelination]], which can be detected by measuring nerve conduction velocities.  [[Autosomal dominant]].  Usually shows up in infancy.  LITAF Gene (16p13.1-p12.3) Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 26-42[[Metre per second|m/s]].  Identical symptoms to CMT-1A.
*'''CMT type 1D''' - '''CMD1D''' - EGR2 Gene (10q21.1-q22.1) - Average [[NCV]]: 15-20[[m/s]]

===CMT Type 2 (CMT2)===
Type 2 affects approximately 20-40% of CMT patients.  Type 2 CMT is [[Autosomal dominant]] neuropathy  with its main affect on the axon.  The average [[nerve conduction velocity]] is slightly below normal, but generally above 38[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*'''CMT type 2A''' - '''CMT2A''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=118210 OMIM 118210]) - The cause is likely located on chromosome 1 for the mitofusion 2 (MFN2) protein ([[locus]] 1p36).   Some research has also linked this form of CMT to the protein kinesin 1B (KIF1B) (1p36.2). Does not show up on nerve condution velocity tests, because it is caused by [[axonopathy]].
*'''CMT type 2B''' - '''CMT2B''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=600882 OMIM 600882]) - RAB7 gene (3q21).

*'''CMT type 2D''' - '''CMT2D''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601472 OMIM 601472]) - GARS gene (7p15). Patients with mutations in the GARS gene tend to have more severe symptoms in the upper extremities (hands), which is atypical for CMT in general.
*'''CMT type 2E''' - '''CMT2E''' - NEFL gene (8p21).
*'''CMT type 2F''' - '''CMT2F''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=606595 OMIM 606595]) - HSPB1 gene (7q11-q21).
*'''CMT type 2G''' - '''CMT2G''' - (12q12-13)
*'''CMT type 2H''' - '''CMT2H''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607731 OMIM 607731])
*'''CMT type 2J''' - '''CMT2J''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607736 OMIM 607736]) - (1q22)
*'''CMT type 2K''' - '''CMT2K''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=607831 OMIM 607831]) - (8q13-q21.1)
*'''CMT type 2L''' - '''CMT2L''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=608673 OMIM 608673]) - (12q24)

===CMT Type 3 (CMT3)===
Type 3 affects a very few CMT patients.
*'''CMT type 3''' - '''CMT3''' - Rarely found. [[Autosomal recessive]]. Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: Normal (50-60m/s)
===CMT Type 4 (CMT4)===
Type 4 affects a very few CMT patients.
*'''CMT type 4A''' - '''CMT4A''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=214400 OMIM 214400]) - GDAP1 Gene ([[locus]] 8q13-q21.1) - [[Autosomal recessive]].
*'''CMT type 4B1''' - '''CMT4B1''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601382 OMIM 601382]) - MTMR2 Gene (11q22) - [[Autosomal recessive]].
*'''CMT type 4B2''' - '''CMT4B2''' - CMT4B2 Gene, may be called &quot;SBF2/MTMR13&quot; (11p15) - [[Autosomal recessive]].

*'''CMT type 4D''' - '''CMT4D''' - NDRG1 Gene (8q24.3)
*'''CMT type 4E''' - '''CMT4E''' - EGR2 (10q21.1-10q22.1) - &quot;CMT4E&quot; is a tentative name
*'''CMT type 4F''' - '''CMT4F''' - PRX (19q13.1-19q13.2) - &quot;CMT4F&quot; is a tentative name

===CMT X-Linked (CMTX)===
CMTX affects approximately 10-20% of CMT patients and is [[Dominant gene|X-linked dominant]].
*'''CMTX''' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=302800 OMIM 302800]) - GJB1 Gene ([[locus]] Xq13.1) - Average [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]]: 25-40[[Metre per second|m/s]]
*Other X-linked forms - Approx 10% of X-linked CMT patients have some other form than CMTX.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Central pontine myelinolysis''' is a neurologic disease caused by severe damage of the [[myelin sheath]] of [[neuron|nerve cells]] in the [[brainstem]], more precisely in the area termed the ''[[pons]]''. The most common cause is the rapid correction of low blood sodium levels ([[hyponatremia]]). Some scholars postulate that the real cause might be the lack of a substance that is essential for brain activity and is lacking due to malnutrition. The fact that this condition is most frequently observed in patients with general ill health ([[alcoholism]], [[cachexia]] etc.) is in accordance with this assumption. Imaging by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] demonstrates an area of high signal return on T2 weighted images. Frequently observed symptoms in this disorder are weakness, [[double vision]] and [[coma|loss of consciousness]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Crystalline solids have a very regular atomic structure: that is, the local positions of atoms with respect to each other are repeated at the atomic scale. These arrangements are called [[crystal]] structures, and their study is called [[crystallography]].  However, most crystalline materials are not perfect: the regular pattern of atomic arrangement is interrupted by '''crystal defects'''.  The various types of defects are enumerated here.

==Point defects==

* Vacancies are sites which are usually occupied by an atom but which are unoccupied.  If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant site, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction to the site which used to be occupied by the moving atom.  The stability of the surrounding crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply collapse around the vacancy.  In some materials, neighboring atoms actually move away from a vacancy, because they can better form bonds with atoms in the other directions.

* [[Interstitial]]s are atoms which occupy a site in the crystal structure at which there is usually not an atom. They are generally high energy configurations. Small atoms in some crystals can occupy interstices without high energy, such as [[hydrogen]] in [[palladium]].

* Impurities occur because  material are never 100% pure.  In the case of an impurity, the atom is often incorporated at a regular atomic site in the crystal structure.   This is neither a vacant site nor is the atom on an interstitial site and it is called a ''substitutional'' defect.  The atom is not supposed to be anywhere in the crystal, and is thus an impurity.  

* Anti-site defects occur in an ordered alloy.  For example, some alloys have a regular structure in which every other atom is a different species, for illustration assume that type A atoms sit on the cube corners of a cubic lattice, and type B atoms sit in center of the cubes.  If one cube has an A atom at its center, the atom is on a site usually occupied by an atom, but it is not the correct type.  This is neither a vacancy nor an interstitial, nor an impurity.

* Complexes can form between different kinds of point defects.  For example, if a vacancy encounters an impurity, the two may bind together if the impurity is too large for the lattice.  Interstitials can form 'split interstitial' or 'dumbbell' structures where two atoms effectively share an atomic site, resulting in neither atom actually occupying the site.

==Line defects==

Line defects can be described by gauge theories.

* [[Dislocation]]s are linear defects around which some of the atoms of the crystal lattice are misaligned. There are two basic types of dislocations, the EDGE dislocation and the SCREW dislocation. (&quot;MIXED&quot; dislocations combining aspects of both types are also common).

Edge dislocations are caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal.  In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side.  The analogy with a stack of paper is apt:  if a half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.  

The screw dislocation is more difficult to visualise, but basically comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.

The presence of dislocations results in lattice strain (distortion). The direction and magnitude of such distortion is expressed in terms of a [[Burgers vector]] (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the dislocation line, whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b is aligned with close-packed crytallographic directions and its magnitude is equivalent to one interatomic spacing.

Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge.

It is the presence of dislocations and their ability to readily move (and interact) under the influence of stresses induced by external loads that leads to the characteristic [[malleability]] of metallic materials.

Dislocations can be observed using [[transmission electron microscopy]], [[field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques.

[[Disinclination]]s are line defects corresponding to &quot;adding&quot; or &quot;subtracting&quot; an angle around a line. Basically, this means that if you track the crystal orientation around the line defect, you get a rotation.

==Planar defects==

* Grain boundaries occur where the crystallographic direction of the lattice abruptly changes.  This commonly occurs when two crystals begin growing separately  and then meet.

*Anti phase boundaries occur in ordered alloys:  in this case, the crystallographic direction remains the same, each side of the boundary has an opposite phase:  For example if the ordering is usually ABABABAB, an anti phase boundary takes the form of ABABBABA.

*Stacking faults occur in a number of crystal structures, but the common example is in close packed structures.  face centered cubic (fcc) structures differ from hexagonal close packed (hcp) structures only in stacking order:  both structures have close packed atomic planes with six fold symmetry -- the atoms form equilateral triangles.  When stacking one of these layers on top of another, the atoms are not directly on top of one another -- the first two layers are identical for hcp and fcc, and labelled AB.  If the third layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above those of the first layer, the stacking will be ABA -- this is the hcp structure, and it continues ABABABAB.  However there is another location for the third layer, such that its atoms are not above the first layer.  Instead, the fourth layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above the first layer.  This produces the stacking ABCABCABC, and is actually a cubic arrangement of the atoms.  A stacking fault is a one or two layer interruption in the stacking sequence, for example if the sequence ABCABABCAB were found in an fcc structure.

==Bulk defects==

* Voids are small regions where there are no atoms, and can be thought of as clusters of vacancies.

* Impurities can cluster together to form small regions of a different phase. These are often called precipitates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer science]], a [[formal grammar]] is in '''Chomsky normal form''' ''[[iff]]'' all production rules are of the form:
:''A'' → ''BC'' or
:''A'' → α or
:''S'' → ε

where ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are nonterminal symbols, &amp;alpha; is a [[terminal symbol]] (a symbol that represents a constant value), ''S'' is the start symbol, and &amp;epsilon; is the empty string.

Every grammar in Chomsky normal form is [[context-free grammar|context-free]], and conversely, every context-free grammar can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent one which is in Chomsky normal form.

With the exception of the optional rule ''S'' → ε (included when the grammar may generate the empty string), all rules of a grammar in Chomsky normal form are expansive; thus, throughout the derivation of a string, each string of terminals and nonterminals is always either the same length or one element longer than the previous such string.  The derivation of a string of length n is always exactly 2n-1 steps long.  Furthermore, since all rules deriving nonterminals transform one nonterminal to exactly two nonterminals, a parse tree based on a grammar in Chomsky normal form is a binary tree, and the height of this tree is limited to at most the length of the string.

Because of these properties, many proofs in the field of languages and computability make use of the Chomsky normal form.  These properties also yield various efficient algorithms based on grammars in Chomsky normal form; for example, the [[CYK algorithm]] that decides whether a given string can be generated by a given grammar uses the Chomsky normal form.

The Chomsky normal form is named after [[Noam Chomsky]], the [[United States|US]] linguist who invented the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

The '''Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)''' bans all [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] explosions in all environments, for military or civilian purposes.

==Status==
The Treaty was opened for signature in New York on [[24 September]] [[1996]], when it was signed by 71 States, including five of the seven then nuclear-capable states.  The CTBT had been later endorsed by one hundred seventy five states parties and been ratified by a hundred twenty. [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], though not nuclear weapons states as defined by the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] (NPT), did not sign; neither did [[North Korea]].

Additionally, to enter into force, the treaty has yet to be ratified by (as of December 2005) [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], the [[United States of America|U.S.A.]] and [[Vietnam]], which is unlikely to happen in the near future.

==Obligations==
(Article I):
#Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any [[nuclear weapon]] test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control. 
#Each State Party undertakes, furthermore, to refrain from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. 

==History==

Arms control advocates had campaigned for the adoption of a treaty banning all nuclear explosions since the early [[1950s]], when public concern was aroused as a result of radioactive fall-out from atmospheric nuclear tests and the escalating arms race. Over 50 nuclear explosions were registered between [[16 July]] [[1945]], when the first nuclear explosive test was conducted by the United States at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], and [[31 December]] [[1953]]. [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of [[India]] voiced the heightened international concern in [[1954]], when he proposed the elimination of all nuclear test explosions worldwide. However, within the context of the [[Cold War]], scepticism in the capability to verify compliance with a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty posed a major obstacle to any agreement. On [[13 October]] [[1999]] the [[United States Senate]] rejected ratification of the CTBT.

===[[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], 1963===

Limited success was achieved with the signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space. However, neither France nor China, both nuclear weapon States, signed the PTBT.

===[[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]], 1968===

A major step towards the [[nuclear proliferation |non-proliferation]] of nuclear weapons came with the signing of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968. Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon States were prohibited from, inter alia, possessing, manufacturing or acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All signatories were committed to the goal of [[nuclear disarmament]].

===Negotiations for the CTBT===
Given the political situation prevailing in the subsequent decades, little progress was made in nuclear disarmament until 1991. Parties to the PTBT held an amendment conference that year to discuss a proposal to convert the Treaty into an instrument banning all nuclear-weapon tests; with strong support from the UN General Assembly, negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty began in 1993.

One of the largest issues was the priorities of the different countries.  The Non-aligned movement countries were highly concerned with '''vertical''' proliferation (more and more bombs, new bomb technology) while the Nuclear Powers were focusing on '''horizontal''' proliferation (nuclear bombs being produced by states other than themselves).

===Adoption of the CTBT, 1996===
Intensive efforts were made over the next three years to draft the Treaty text and its two annexes, culminating in the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on [[10 September]] [[1996]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York.

===Monitoring of the CTBT===
[[geophysics|Geophysical]] and other technologies are used to monitor for compliance with the Treaty: [[seismology]], [[hydrophone|hydroacoustics]], [[infrasound]], and [[radionuclide]] monitoring.  On Site Inspection is provided for where concerns about compliance arise.

The Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), an international organization headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was created to build the verification regime, including establishment and provisional operation of the network of monitoring stations, and development of the On Site Inspection capability.

At December 2005, around 65 percent of monitoring stations are operational.

[[Image:dancer-in-motion.png|thumb|right|229px|A contemporary dancer rehearsing]]

'''''Dance''''' (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', perhaps from [[Old Frankish language|Frankish]]) generally refers to [[human]] [[movement]] either used as a form of [[expression]] (see also ''[[body language]]'') or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.

'''''Dance''''' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] between [[human]]s or [[animal]]s ([[Bee learning and communication#Dance language|bee dance]], mating dance), [[motion]] in inanimate objects (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical form]]s or [[music|genre]]s. People who dance are called [[dancer]]s and the act of dance is known as '''dancing'''. An event where dancing takes place may be called '''a dance'''. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]] [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] there are ''dance'' disciplines while [[Martial arts]] '[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]' are often compared to dances. In 1926, William Butler Yeats wrote, in &quot;Among School Children&quot;: ''How can we know the dancer from the dance?''

== History of dance ==

Whitley Locks is by far the best dancer in the history of not only Rocklin highschool...as a freshman...but in the entire world (as ranked by the National Sportscaster Association for ESPN). We love her her but Rosie does especially even more than her boyfriend James.

== Dance and music ==
Although dance and [[music]] can be traced back to [[prehistoric]] times it is unclear which artform came ''first''. However, as [[rhythm]] and [[sound]] are the result of movement, and music can inspire movement, the relationship between the two forms has always been [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]. This relationship serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]] devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]] which was influential to the development of [[Modern dance]] and modern [[ballet]] through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]].

Many early forms of music and dance were created and performed together. This paired development has continued through the ages with dance/music forms such as: [[Jig]],  [[Waltz]], [[Tango music|Tango]], [[Disco]], [[Salsa]], [[Electronica]] and [[Hip-Hop]]. Some [[musical genre]] also have a parallel dance form such as [[Baroque music]] and [[Baroque dance]] where as others developed separately: [[Classical music era|Classical music]], [[Classical ballet]].

Although dance is often accompanied by [[music]], it can also be presented alone ([[Postmodern dance]]) or provide its own accompaniment ([[tap dance]]). Dance presented with music may or may not be performed ''in time'' to the music depending on the style of dance. Dance performed without music is said to be ''danced to its own rhythm''.

== Dance studies ==
[[Image:Roanoke.JPG|thumb|right|200px|John White's eye-witness interpretation of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] dance at [[Roanoke, Virginia]], [[1585]], is affected by his knowledge of [[Elizabethan]] [[court dance]]]]
In the early [[1920s]] dance studies (dance [[practice]], [[critical theory]], [[analysis]] and [[history]]) began to be considered a serious [[academic discipline]]. Today these studies are an integral part of many [[universities]]' [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs. By the late [[20th century]] the recognition of practical [[knowledge]] as equal to academic knowledge lead to the emergence of ''practice-based research'' and ''practice as research''. A large range of dance courses are available including:

* Professional practice: performance and technical skills
* Practice-based research: choreography and performance
* [[Ethnochoreology]], encompassing the dance-related aspects of [[Anthropology]], [[Cultural Studies]], [[Gender Studies]], [[Area studies]], [[Postcolonial theory]], [[Ethnography]], etc.
* Dance and technology: [[new media]] and performance [[technologies]].
* Laban Movement Analysis and [[Somatic]] studies 
* [[Community Dance]].
* [[Dance therapy|Dance-Movement Therapy]].

A full range of [[Academic degree]]s are available from [[Bachelor of Arts|BA (Hons)]] to [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and other [[postdoctoral]] fellowships, with many dance [[scholar]]s taking up their studies as ''mature students'' after a [[professional]] dance career.

== Categories of dance ==
Dance can be divided into two main categories that each have several subcategories into which most dance styles can be placed.  They are:

* '''[[Concert dance]] / [[Performance dance]]'''
** [[20th century concert dance]]
** [[Competitive dance]]

* '''[[Social dance]] / [[Participation dance]]'''
** [[Ceremonial dance]]
** [[Traditional dance]]

These categories are not mutually exclusive and are context-dependent; a particular dance style may belong to several categories.

== Dance as an occupation ==
In the U.S. many professional dancers are members of unions such as the American Guild of Musical Artists, the Screen Actors Guild and Actors' Equity Association.  The unions help determine working conditions and minimum salaries for their members.

The median earnings of U.S. dancers is about $21,000 per year with the top 10% making over $50,000 per year.  Dancers may receive other benefits from their jobs such as room and board (for touring production).  Professional dancers often have the opportunity to teach as well.

'''Drew Blyth Barrymore''' (born [[February 22]], [[1975]] in [[Culver City, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[actor]] and [[Film producer|producer]].
==Her family==
She is the granddaughter of [[theatre|stage]] and movie actor [[John Barrymore]], widely regarded as his generation's greatest actor, and the great-niece of [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Ethel Barrymore]]. Her father, [[John Drew Barrymore]], and half-brother, John Blyth, are also actors (although they haven't experienced the critical or commercial success the other Barrymores have enjoyed). &quot;Drew&quot; was the maiden name of her great-grandmother, Georgiana; &quot;Blythe&quot; was the original surname of the dynasty founded by her great-grandfather, [[Maurice Barrymore|Maurice]]. Drew's mother is [[Magyars|Hungarian]]-born actor and [[Model (person)|model]], Ildiko Jaid Mako (born 1944).

==Biography==
[[Image:Drew_barrymore_in_E.T..jpg|thumb|right|200px|Drew Barrymore in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' ([[1982 in film|1982]]).]]
Barrymore's career began at the age of 11 months, when she appeared in a [[dog]] food commercial. When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers feared litigation, though Barrymore merely laughed the incident off. 

She shot to fame as a [[child actor]] when she co-starred in the [[1982]] [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. At the age of 7, on [[November 20]], [[1982 in television|1982]], Barrymore became the youngest ever guest host of the weekly TV program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. She performed in a skit where she revealed that she had killed E.T..

In the wake of this sudden stardom, she endured a notoriously troubled childhood, drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s by the time she was 9, smoking [[marijuana]] at 10, and snorting [[cocaine]] at 12. [[Image:Playboy0195.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Drew Barrymore on the cover of ''[[Playboy]]'', January [[1995]]]]Barrymore later described this early period of her life in her [[1990]] [[autobiography]], ''Little Girl Lost''. Though overcoming her substance abuse problems by the time she entered adulthood, Barrymore maintained her &quot;bad girl&quot; image, and in fact leveraged her new found role as a [[sex symbol]] to stage a career comeback in the [[1990s]], playing a teenage seductress in ''[[Poison Ivy (film)|Poison Ivy]]'', and posing [[nude]] for the [[January 1995]] issue of U.S. magazine ''[[Playboy]]''. [[Steven Spielberg]], Barrymore's godfather, gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read &quot;Cover yourself up&quot;. Enclosed was a copy of her ''Playboy'' appearance, with the pictures altered by his art department so that she appeared fully clothed. At that time she had also appeared [[nudity|nude]] in her last five movies. During a [[1995]] appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Barrymore shocked the normally unflappable host by climbing onto his desk and flashing her [[breast]]s at him (but with her back to the camera), as part of a dance for his birthday.  She also modelled in a series of [[Guess?]] jeans advertisements during this time.

[[Image:Drew_barrymore_on_letterman.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Drew Barrymore on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in [[1995]], immediately after notoriously flashing the host on-air for his birthday.]]

Barrymore has continued to be a highly bankable movie actress. She is especially adept at [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]]; popular examples of her work include ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' and ''[[50 First Dates]]''. Though her playful sex appeal has undoubtedly helped her remain in the media spotlight, she has also established a substantial career behind the scenes, despite never finishing high school. She has produced several films, including the highly successful ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' movie adaptation and its sequel. 

She has also recently explored more dramatic roles in movies such as ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'', where she played a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on the real-life story of [[Beverly D'Onofrio]]),  ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'', and the [[cult film|cult favorite]] ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', of which she was also the executive producer. Barrymore has started to receive more notice both as a serious actress and a savvy Hollywood &quot;player&quot;, though without losing her reputation as a sex symbol and (occasional) hellraiser.

Barrymore's career makes for colorful copy. In the words of [http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id=1800016287&amp;cf=biog&amp;intl=us Yahoo! Movies]:

:''Heir to a Hollywood dynasty, child star, prepubescent drug and alcohol abuser, teenage sexpot, and resurrected vessel of celluloid purity, Drew Barrymore is nothing if not the embodiment of the rise and fall of Hollywood fortunes, self-reinvention, and the healing powers of good PR.''

More recently, Barrymore was the subject of an offbeat documentary, ''[[My Date with Drew]]'' (2003).  In it, an aspiring filmmaker and lifelong Drew Barrymore fan uses his limited financial and social resources in an attempt to gain a date with Barrymore.  Through word of mouth, the internet, and a six-degrees-of-separation style of communication with Barrymore and her associates, a date with Barrymore is eventually acquired.  Barrymore proved to be a good sport on the date, bringing a video camera to the fan as a gift and finding humor in the events.

On [[February 3]], [[2004 in film|2004]], she received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Barrymore was married to Welsh bartender turned bar owner, Jeremy Thomas, from [[March 20]] to [[April 28]], [[1994]], and to comedian [[Tom Green]] from [[July 7]], [[2001]] to [[October 15]], [[2002]] (Green filed for divorce in December 2001). She is [[as of 2004|currently]] dating drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] of [[The Strokes]]. Barrymore has also publicly declared herself to be [[bisexuality|bisexual]], revealing that she had slept with many women as a teenager and is still interested in women sexually.

==Trivia==
* Barrymore was delivered by [[Paul M. Fleiss|Dr. Paul Fleiss]], father of [[Heidi Fleiss]] (interview on ''The [[Tonight Show]]'', [[January 22]], [[2003]]).
* She is the godmother of [[Frances Bean Cobain]], the daughter of musicians [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Courtney Love]].
* She is the goddaughter of filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]].
* She has 6 tattoos: a crescent moon on her big toe, a cross with ivy on her lower leg, a butterfly on her stomach, a daisy on her hip, and 2 angels on her lower back (one has a banner with her mother's name, Jaid, and the other has the name James--a tribute to her then-boyfriend Jamie Walters).
* She was the second ever guest on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]], appearing on the first show with [[John Goodman]] and the late [[Tony Randall]].

'''David Llewelyn Wark Griffith''', commonly known as '''D.W. Griffith''' ([[January 22]], [[1875]]&amp;ndash;[[July 23]], [[1948]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]]. He is best known for being the director of he controversial film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''.

==Biography==
&lt;!--No SOurce Information: [[Image:DWGriffith.jpg|thumb|D.W. Griffith]]--&gt;
Griffith was born in [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]], [[Oldham County, Kentucky]] to [[Jacob Griffith|Jacob &quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith]], a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] colonel and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hero. He began his career as a hopeful [[playwright]] but met with little success. He then became an actor. Finding his way into the motion picture business, he soon began to direct a huge body of work.

Between 1908 and 1913 (the years he directed for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]]), Griffith produced 450 short films, an enormous number even for this period. This work enabled him to experiment with [[cross-cutting]], camera movement, [[close-up]]s, and other methods of spatial and temporal manipulation.  

On Griffith's first trip to California, he and his company discovered a little village to film their movies in. This place was known as [[Hollywood]]. With this, [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] was the first company to shoot a movie in Hollywood: ''[[In Old California (1910)|In Old California]]'' (1910). 

Influenced by a European feature film &quot;[[Cabiria]]&quot; from Italy, Griffith was convinced that longer films (then called &quot;features&quot;) could be financially viable. He produced and directed the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]]  feature film [[Judith of Bethulia]]. This was one, if not &quot;The&quot; first feature ever produced in the United States. [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] believed that longer features were not viable, and as actress [[Lillian Gish]] puts it &quot;They (Biograph) thought that a movie that long would hurt their (The audience's) eyes&quot;. Because of this, and the overrun on the budget by the film which cost 30,000 dollars to produce, Griffith and [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] parted ways, with Griffith taking his whole stock company of actors with him. His new production company became an autonomous production unit partner in Triangle Pictures Corporation with [[Keystone Studios]] and [[Thomas Ince]]. Through David W. Griffith Corp. he produced ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915).

''Birth of a Nation'' was extremely popular but expressed the racist views of the era. The film ends with the Ku Klux Klan galloping in to save the heroine.  In reaction to protests, Griffith mounted his most ambitious project, ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', an epic spanning several thousand years of human history. The film was a flop, and the Triangle partnership was dissolved in 1917, so Griffith went to Artcraft (part of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), then to [[First National]] (1919-20). At the same time he founded [[United Artists]], together with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

Though United Artists survived as a company, Griffith's association with it was short-lived, and while some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him.  Features from this period include ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920), ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921) and ''[[America (movie)|America]]'' (1924).  Griffith made only two sound films, ''[[Abraham Lincoln (movie)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Struggle]]'' (1931).  Neither was successful, and he never made another film.

Griffith Park in [[Los Angeles]] is named for D. W. Griffith.

==Achievements==
Griffith has been called the father of [[film grammar]]. Few scholars still hold that his &quot;innovations&quot; really began with him, but Griffith was a key figure in establishing the set of codes that have become the universal backbone of film language. He was particularly influential in popularizing &quot;cross-cutting&quot; - using [[film editing]] to alternate between different events occurring at the same time - in order to build [[suspense]]. That being said, he still used many elements from the &quot;primitive&quot; style of movie-making that predated [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]]'s continuity system, such as frontal staging, exaggerated gestures, minimal camera movement, and an absence of [[point of view shot]]s.  Some claim, too, that he &quot;invented&quot; the [[close-up]] shot.

Credit for Griffith's cinematic innovations must be shared with his cameraman of many years, [[Billy Bitzer]].  In addition, he himself credited the legendary silent star [[Lillian Gish]], who appeared in several of his films, with creating a new style of acting for the cinema.

[[Image:wiki_dwgriffith.JPG|thumb|left|Stamp issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] commemorating D. W. Griffith.]]

==Controversy==
Griffith was a highly controversial figure.  Immensely popular at the time of its release, his film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), based on the novel ''[[The Clansman]]'', is widely considered responsible for the resurgence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the United States. The [[NAACP]] attempted to have ''The Birth of a Nation'' banned. After that effort failed, they then attempted to have some of the film's scenes censored.

==Legacy==
Motion picture legend [[Charles Chaplin]] called Griffith &quot;The Teacher Of Us All&quot;.  This sentiment was widely shared.  Filmmakers as diverse as [[John Ford]] and [[Orson Welles]] have spoken of their respect for the director of ''[[Intolerance]]''.  Whether he actually invented new techniques in film grammar, he seems to have been among the first to understand how these techniques could be used to create an expressive language.  In early shorts such as Biograph's ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912) which was the first &quot;Gangster film&quot;, we can see how Griffith's attention to camera placement and lighting heighten mood and tension.  In making ''[[Intolerance]]'' the director opened up new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditonal narrative.

Griffith was honored on a 10-cent postage stamp by the [[United States]] issued [[May 5]], [[1975]].

In [[1953]], the [[Directors Guild of America]] instituted the [[D.W. Griffith Award]], its Guild's highest honor. Its recipients included [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[David Lean]], [[John Huston]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[John Ford]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and Griffith's friend [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. On [[15 December]], [[1999]], however, DGA President Jack Shea and the DGA National Board - without membership consultation (though unecessary according to DGA's regulations)- announced that the award would be renamed the [[DGA Lifetime Achievement Award]] because Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' had &quot;helped foster intolerable racial stereotypes&quot;. The following living recipients of the award agreed with the guild's decision: [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Robert Wise]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Direct realism''' is a theory of [[perception]] that claims that the [[senses]] provide us with direct [[awareness]] of the [[external world]]. In contrast, [[indirect realism]] and [[representationalism]] claim that we are directly aware only of internal representations of the external world. 

Direct realists sometimes claim that indirect realists are confused about conventional [[idiom]]s of perceptions. Perception is an exemplar of direct contact with something. Examples of indirect perception might be seeing something in a photograph, or hearing a recording of a voice. Direct realists often argue, contra representationalists, that the fact that one becomes aware of a tree in perception through a complex neurophysical process does not argue in favour of indirect perception. It merely establishes the method, undoubtedly complex, by which direct awareness of the world is secured. Arguing that perceiving a tree directly requires a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]al, [[causality|acausal]] mirroring of the tree in the mind is akin to arguing that traveling directly to grandmother's requires that one magically appear at her doorstep. The inference from the fact of a complex route to indirectness may be an instance of the [[genetic fallacy]].

Direct realism proposes no physical theory of experience and does not identify experience with the [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] phenomena that are things in themselves or even with the twin [[retina]]l images. This lack of [[supervenience]] of experience on the physical world means that direct realism is not a physical theory.

==Examples of the direct realist approach==
[[Scottish people|Scottish]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] lived at the same time as [[David Hume]]. Reid argued strenuously against the notion that ideas, or sense-data, are the immediate objects of perception at all -- he rejected representationalism.

One of Reid's arguments was very simple, and went like this: If representationalism is correct, then we are forced to either [[skepticism]] or [[phenomenalism]]. But skepticism and phenomenalism are both [[absurd]]; there surely is an external world, and we surely do have [[knowledge]] of it. So, by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', we must reject any [[theory]] that would force us to accept either skepticism or phenomenalism. So, we must reject representationalism.

What would it mean to reject representationalism? It would mean accepting that we do not perceive [[sense data]] at all. When I look at my hand, I do not immediately perceive a bundle or series of hand sense data which represent my actual hand. No, I immediately perceive my hand. I do not perceive any hand sense-data at all. So the view up for consideration now is that we immediately, directly perceive the external world.

This view is called ''direct realism'', which Reid championed brilliantly:&lt;blockquote&gt;Direct realism is the view that the immediate (direct) objects of perception are external [[objects]], [[qualities]], and [[events]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;Do not confuse direct realism with the more naïve view discussed earlier, that the world is exactly as we perceive it to be. Obviously, sometimes we misperceive the world. The direct realist does not deny that there are perceptual illusions. The claim is, rather, simply that when we do perceive something, what we directly perceive, the immediate object of perception, is in the external world, not in the mind.

Nonetheless, the argument from illusion can be taken as an argument against direct realism because the argument from illusion shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. How might direct realism answer the argument from illusion?

One strategy is to show how all those different cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity -- all those hard cases -- do not really make it necessary to suppose that there are sense-data. Those cases might be explained without having to talk about sense-data.

Take first the case of the stick that looks bent in the water. Direct realism doesn't say that the stick actually is bent; it says, rather, that the stick, which is straight, can, in some unusual circumstances, look bent. And to say that it looks bent is just to say that the light, which is reflected from the stick, arrives at our eyes in a crooked pattern. So the stick can have more than one appearance. But the appearance of a stick isn't a sense-datum in my mind. It's a pattern of light, the sort of things that physicists can study, that arrives at my eye. What's mysterious about that? A similar sort of thing can be said about the bluish color of the hills in the distance. Hills, and everything else, can appear with all sorts of different colors; but the color is simply the wavelength of light as it reaches my eye. If the light from the green hills has to traverse many miles, then it may be bluish when it arrives at my eyes. There's no need to suppose I am seeing bluish sense-data: nope, what I'm seeing is bluish light, which comes from the hills. The hills would reflect green light to my eyes if I were closer to them.

Now the case of pressing on my eyeball, and getting a double image. Well, it's undeniable that, when I cross my eyes and seem to see two fingers, there are two of something. But of what? Why say there are two sense-data? Why not, instead, say that I have two eyes, and each eye gives me a different view upon the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they're not. And as a result, each eye sees things in a different way. That doesn't mean that I see two visual sense-data in my mind; but it does mean that there are two slightly different acts of vision going on. One for each eye! What's mysterious about that? Nothing, as far as I can tell. And similar things can be said about the coin that appears both circular and oval-shaped: so the same coin can reflect different patterns of light to my eye. Does that mean that I perceive two different sense-data? No, all it means is that I perceive the same coin in two different ways.

Now as for Mary's vivid hallucination of the pink elephants. It was so vivid that the elephants were just as real as real elephants. We said this was evidence for thinking that she is perceiving sense-data; she sure as heck isn't perceiving elephants, and yet she seems to be hallucinating something. So maybe it's elephant sense-data that she is hallucinating. Well, that seems like a pretty tough case to deal with. It definitely does seem that there is an object, in some sense, of Mary's hallucination; but this object is only in her mind. Isn't that what we'd call sense-data?

The direct realist might reply to that case as follows: Mary was not perceiving anything at all; she was hallucinating. That's a different, though related, mental process. So maybe Mary has visual images of some sort when she is hallucinating; that wouldn't mean that she has such images when she engages in actual sense-perception.

This may not be a particularly strong reply. If there are visual images when we hallucinate, it seems reasonable to think that there are visual images when we see. It's the same way with dreams: if there are visual and auditory images of some sort in our minds, when we dream, it seems reasonable to think that there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. We might ask for a better reply.

Some people end up denying that there are any such things as mental images at all, but this is rather hard to maintain, since we seem to be able to imagine all sorts of things: for example, here's something that will give you an image: imagine a square, then imagine the top of the square popping off and disappearing, and the two sides of the square collapsing together at a point, to make a triangle. Even if it should happen that perception does not involve images, other mental processes, like imagination, certainly seem to.

==Mental images==
The topic of mental images is very complicated and controversial.

One considered view is similar to Reid's. It is that, in some sense, we do indeed have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, and dream, and hallucinate, and use our imaginations, but when we actually perceive things, our sensory images, or sensations, if you will (that's Reid's word), cannot be considered the objects of perception, or attention, in any sense whatsoever. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it's wrong to say we perceive sensations.

This conclusion shows that direct realism simply defines perception as perception of external objects where an 'external object' is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these. As le Morvan (2004) points out, such a shared ontology is fatal for direct realism.

[[image:Mesquite_Sand_Dunes.JPG|thumb|300px|Mesquite Flat Dunes in [[Death Valley National Park]]]] 
In physical [[geography]], a '''dune''' is a [[hill]] of [[sand]] built by [[eolian]] ([[wind]]-related) processes. Bare dunes are subject to shifting location and size based on their interaction with the wind. The &quot;valley&quot; or trough between dunes is called a ''slack''. A &quot;dune field&quot; is an area covered by extensive sand dunes. 

Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most such cases the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds.

Dunes also form under the action of water flow ([[alluvial]] processes), on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river|rivers]], [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.

==Types of dune==
===Crescentic===
The most common dune form on Earth (and on Mars) is the crescentic. Crescent-shaped mounds generally are wider than long. The slipface is on the dune's concave side. These dunes form under winds that blow from one direction, and they also are known as barchans, or transverse dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes move faster over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 meters per year between 1954 and 1959 in [[China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]]; similar rates have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than 3 kilometers, are in China's [[Taklamakan]] Desert.

===Linear===
Straight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer than they are wide are known as linear dunes. They may be more than 160 kilometers long. Linear dunes may occur as isolated ridges, but they generally form sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel, or rocky interdune corridors. Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes. Many form in bidirectional wind regimes. The long axes of these dunes extend in the resultant direction of sand movement.

===Star===
Radially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 meters tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.

===Dome===
Oval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface, dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.
[[Image:Parabolic_dune.jpg|200px|thumb|Parabolic dune partially stabilized by [[marram grass]]]]

===Parabolic===
U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, blowout, or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescentic dunes, their crests point upwind. The elongated arms of parabolic dunes follow rather than lead because they have been fixed by vegetation, while the bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.
;

===Combined types===
[[Image:SandDuneNamibDesert.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Complex dune: [[Dune 7]] in the [[Namib desert]], one of the tallest in the world.]] 
Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above types. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions.

All these dune types may occur in three forms: simple, compound, and complex. Simple dunes are basic forms with a minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed, and complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.

==Coastal dunes==
[[Image:Curonian spit.jpg|200px|thumb|Coastal dunes in [[Curonian spit]]]]
Dunes form on coasts where the backshore can support and onshore winds encourage the accumulation of sand blown inland from off a beach.  Any part of the upper beach, once dry, can lose sand to the wind, especially if the sand is fine, and dune formation proceeds in the direction towards which the predominant wind direction is blowing.

Dunes provide [[privacy]] and shelter from the [[wind]].  

===Succession on coastal dunes===
[[Image:Studland fore dune.jpg|frame|The fore dune and first yellow dune at [[Studland]], [[England]]]]

As a dune forms, plant [[succession]] occurs.  The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds.  The dune is well drained and often dry.  Rotting sea weed brought in by storm waves adds enough nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize dune.  These pioneer species are [[marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in England.  These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the fore dune, typically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]].  The deep roots also bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[fore dune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses.  The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes.  Typically these are [[heather]]s and [[gorse]]s.  These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration.  Heathers add [[humus]] to the soil, but have a [[pH]] of lower than 7, so make the soil slightly [[acidic]].  Heathers are usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees which can tolerate the low pH.  Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.

Young dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s, dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s.  Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. 

For the [[snow]] analogue to a sand dune see [[sastruga]].

==Sub-aqueous dunes==
Sub-Aqueous ([[underwater]]) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow.  They are ubiquitous in natural [[Channel (geography)|channels]] such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered [[Canal|canals]] and pipelines.  Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope.  

These dunes most often form as a continuous 'train' of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in [[wavelength]] and height.  

Dunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river [[flooding]].

== Longitudinal and transverse dunes ==
[[Image:Seif.gif|right|250px]]
Longitudinal dunes, also called Seif dunes, elongate parallel to the prevailing wind, possibly caused by a larger dune having its smaller sides blown away. Seif dunes are sharp-crested and are common in the Sahara. They range up to 300 m (900 ft) in height and 300 km (200 mi) in length.

Seif dunes are thought to develop from barchans if a change of wind direction occurs. The new wind direction will lead to the development of a new wing and the overdevelopment of one of the original wings. If the prevailing wind then becomes dominant for a lengthy period of time the dune will revert to its barchan form, with one exaggerated wing. Should the strong wind then return the exaggerated wing will further extend so that eventually it will be supplied with sand when the prevailing wind returns. The wing will continue to grow under both wind conditions, thus producing a seif dune. On a seif dune the slip face develops on the side facing away from the strong wind, while the slip face of a barchan faces the direction of movement. In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes barchans may be formed because the wind is unidirectional.

A transverse dune is horizontal to the prevailing wind, probably caused by a steady buildup of sand on an already existing minuscule mound.

==Lithified dunes==
A lithified (consolidated) sand dune is a type of sandstone that is formed when a marine or eolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the hue of the rock. Cross-bedded layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in [[Zion National Park]].

A local slang term used for these consolidated dunes is &quot;slickrock&quot;, a name that was introduced by pioneers of the old west because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain purchase on the rock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:DAVID LYNCH (CannesPhotocall).jpg|right|200px|thumb|David Lynch at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] in [[2001 in film|2001]]]]

'''David Keith Lynch''' (born [[January 20]], [[1946]], in [[Missoula, Montana]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[filmmaker]].

Lynch's films are known for their elements of [[surrealism]], their nightmarish and [[dream]]like sequences, their stark and strange images, and their meticulously crafted audio. Most of his work explores the seedy underside of small-town U.S.A. (e.g. ''[[Blue Velvet]]'' and the &quot;[[Twin Peaks]]&quot; television series) or sprawling metropolises (''[[Eraserhead]],'' ''[[Lost Highway]],'' ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''). Due to his peculiar style and focus on the American psyche, producer [[Mel Brooks]] once called Lynch, &quot;[[Jimmy Stewart]] from [[Mars]].&quot;

Lynch is one of the few modern directors whose visual and verbal styles are instantly recognizable. Although never a box office giant or a consistent favorite of film critics, he has maintained a [[cult following]].

== Career ==
=== Early days ===
Lynch grew up an archetypal all-American boy. His father was a [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] research scientist. He was raised throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]].  He attained the rank of [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], and on his fifteenth birthday served as an usher at [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Presidential inauguration.

With the intention of becoming a painter, Lynch attended classes at [[Corcoran School of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] while finishing high school.  He enrolled in the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston for one year before leaving for [[Europe]] with the plan to study with [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]].  Though he had planned to stay for three years, Lynch returned to the US after 15 days.

=== Philadelphia and the short films===
In [[1966]], Lynch relocated to [[Philadelphia]], attended the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] ([[PAFA]]) and made a series of complex mosaics in geometric shapes which he called ''Industrial Symphonies''. Here too he began working with film. His first [[short film]] ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#Six Figures Getting Sick|Six Figures Getting Sick]]'' (1966), which he described as &quot;57 seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit,&quot; was played on a loop at an art exhibit. It won the Academy’s annual film contest. This led to a commission from H. Barton Wasserman to do a film installation in his home. After a disastrous first attempt that resulted in a completely blurred, frameless print, Lynch created ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Alphabet|The Alphabet]]''.

In [[1970]], Lynch turned his attention away from visual art and focused primarily on film. He won a $5,000 grant from the [[American Film Institute]] to produce ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]'', about a neglected boy who “grows” a grandmother from a [[seed]]. The 30-minute film exhibited many elements that would become Lynch trademarks, including unsettling sound and imagery and a focus on [[subconscious]] desires instead of traditional narration.

===''Eraserhead''===
[[Image:Eraserset1.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Lynch and actor Jack Nance on the set of ''Eraserhead'' (1978)]]
In [[1971]], Lynch moved to [[Los Angeles]] to attend the M.F.A. studies at the [[AFI Conservatory]]. At the Conservatory, Lynch began working on his first feature-length film, ''[[Eraserhead]],'' using a $10,000 grant from the AFI. The grant did not provide enough money to complete the film and, due to lack of a sufficient budget, ''Eraserhead'' was filmed intermittently until [[1977]]. Lynch used money from friends and family, including boyhood friend [[Jack Fisk]], a production designer and the husband of actress [[Sissy Spacek]], and even took a paper route to finish it.

A stark and enigmatic film, ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of a quiet young man ([[Jack Nance]]) living in an industrial wasteland, whose wife gives birth to a constantly hissing [[mutant]] freak of a baby. Lynch has referred to ''Eraserhead'' as &quot;my [[The Philadelphia Story|Philadelphia story]]&quot;, meaning it reflects all of the dangerous and fearful elements he encountered while studying and living in [[Philadelphia]] ([http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html]). He said &quot;this feeling left its traces deep down inside me. And when it came out again, it became ''Eraserhead''&quot;. 

The film also reflects the director's own fears and anxieties about fatherhood, personified in the form of the bizarre baby, which has become one of the most notorious props in film history. Lynch refuses to discuss how the baby was made, and a long-standing [[urban legend]] claims that it was created using an embalmed [[cattle|cow]] [[fetus]] [http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Interview/4749/Eraserheadfaq.htm#6.%20How%20the%20heck%20did%20Lynch%20make%20the%20baby?]. 

The final film was initially judged to be almost unreleasable, but thanks to the efforts of distributor [[Ben Barenholtz]], it became an instant [[cult classic]] and was a staple of midnight movie showings for the next decade. It was also a critical success, launching Lynch to the forefront of [[avant-garde]] filmmaking. [[Stanley Kubrick]] expressed that it was one of his all-time favorite films. It cemented the team of actors and technicians who would continue to define the texture of his work for years to come, including cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]], sound designer [[Alan Splet]], and actor [[Jack Nance]].

===''The Elephant Man'', ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet''===
''Eraserhead'' brought Lynch to the attention of producer [[Mel Brooks]] who hired him to direct [[1980]]’s ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]],'' a [[biopic]] of deformed [[Victorian era]] socialite [[Joseph Merrick]]. The film was a huge financial and commercial success and earned eight [[Academy Award]] nominations, including a [[Best Director]] nod for Lynch. It also established his place as a commercially viable, if somewhat dark and unconventional, [[Hollywood]] director.

Afterwards, Lynch agreed to direct a big budget adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]’s [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' for [[Italy|Italian]] producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]]’s [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] on the condition that the company release a second Lynch project, over which the director would have complete creative control. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be the next ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]],'' Lynch’s ''Dune'' ([[1984]]) was a critical and commercial dud, costing $45 million to make and grossing a mere $15 million domestically. The film may have been hampered by cuts--the 137-minute film was cut down from Lynch’s three and a half hour [[director's cut]] in a way that made the plot incomprehensible. The studio released an &quot;extended cut&quot; of the film for syndicated television in which some legitimate footage originally cut from the film was reinstated; however the main caveat was that certain shots from elsewhere in the film were repeated throughout the story to give the impression that other footage had been added.  Whatever the case, this was not representative of Lynch’s intended cut, but rather a cut that the studios felt was more comprehensible than the original theatrical cut. Lynch objected to these changes and disowned the extended cut, which has [[Allen Smithee]] credited as the director.  This version has since been released on video worldwide.

Lynch’s second De Laurentiis-financed project was [[1986]]’s ''[[Blue Velvet]],'' the story of a college student ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) who discovers the dark side of his small hometown after investigating a severed ear he finds in a field. The film featured memorable performances from [[Isabella Rossellini]] as a tormented lounge singer and [[Dennis Hopper]] as a crude, [[sociopath|sociopathic]] criminal and leader of a small gang of backwater hoodlums.

''Blue Velvet''  was a huge critical success and earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination. The film introduced several common elements of his work, including abused women, the dark underbelly of small towns, and unconventional uses of vintage songs. [[Bobby Vinton]]’s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and [[Roy Orbison]]’s &quot;[[In Dreams]]&quot; are both featured in disturbing ways. It was also the first time Lynch worked with composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would contribute to all of his future full-length films.

===''Twin Peaks'', ''Wild at Heart'', ''Industrial Symphonies'' and ''Hotel Room''===
After failing to secure funding for several completed scripts in the late 1980s, Lynch collaborated with [[television]] producer [[Mark Frost]] on the show ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', about a small [[Washington]] town that is the site of several bizarre happenings. The show centered around the investigation by [[FBI]] [[Special Agent Dale Cooper]] (Kyle MacLachlan) into the death of popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]], an investigation that unearthed the secrets of many town residents. Lynch directed six episodes of the series, including the [[Television pilot|pilot]], and wrote or co-wrote several more.

[[Image:LynchTIME.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Lynch on the cover of the [[October 1]], [[1990]] issue of [[Time Magazine]].]]
The show debuted on the [[ABC Network]] on [[April 8]], [[1990]] and slowly rose from cult hit to cultural phenomenon. No other Lynch-related project has gained such mainstream acceptance. [[Catch phrase]]s from the show entered the cultural dialect and parodies of it were seen on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Lynch appeared on the cover of [[Time magazine]] largely because of the success of the series. Lynch, who has seldom acted in his career, also appeared on the show as the partially-deaf, continually-shouting FBI Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole.

However, Lynch clashed with the ABC Network on several matters, particularly whether or not to reveal Laura Palmer’s killer. The network insisted that the revelation be made during the second season but Lynch wanted the mystery to last as long as the series. Lynch soon became disenchanted with the series (many cast members would complain of feeling abandoned) and, after shooting the Twin Peaks pilot episode, set off to work on the film ''[[Wild at Heart]].''

Adapted from the novel by [[Barry Gifford]], ''Wild at Heart'' was an almost hallucinatory [[crime fiction|crime]]/[[road movie]] starring [[Nicholas Cage]] and [[Laura Dern]]. It won the coveted [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990]] [[Cannes Film Festival]] but met with a muted response from American critics and viewers. Reportedly, several people walked out of [[test screening]]s.

The missing link between Twin Peaks and Wild at Heart, however, is ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted''. It was originally presented on-stage at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in [[New York City]] on [[November 10]], [[1989]] as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'' is another collaboration between composer Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch. It features ten songs by [[Julee Cruise]] and stars several members of the Twin Peaks cast as well as Nick Cage, Laura Dern and Julee Cruise. Lynch described this musical spectacle as the &quot;sound effects and music and ... happening on the stage. And, it has something to do with, uh, a relationship ending.&quot; David Lynch produced a 50 minute video of the performance in [[1990]].

Meanwhile, ''Twin Peaks'' suffered a severe ratings drop, and was cancelled in [[1991]]. Still, Lynch scripted a [[prequel]] to the series, about the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. The resulting film, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' ([[1992]]), flopped at the box office and garnered the most negative reviews of Lynch’s career.

As a quick blip during this time period, he and [[Mark Frost]] wrote and directed several episodes of the short lived comedy series ''[[On the Air]]'' for ABC, which followed the zany antics at a 1940's TV studio. In the US only two episodes were aired, although seven were filmed; In the Netherlands all 7 were aired by [[VPRO]].

His next project was much more low-key; he directed two episodes of a three-episode [[HBO]] [[mini-series]] called ''[[Hotel Room]]'' about events that happened in the same hotel room in a span of decades.
[[Image:Lost-Higway-01.jpg|right|190px|thumb|''Lost Highway'' (1997)]]

===''Lost Highway'', ''The Straight Story'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''INLAND EMPIRE''===
In [[1997]], Lynch returned with the non-linear, [[film noir|noir]]-like film ''[[Lost Highway]]'', co-written by Barry Gifford and starring [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics. However, thanks in part to a soundtrack featuring [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Rammstein]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Smashing Pumpkins]], it helped gain Lynch a new audience of [[Generation X]] viewers.

In 1999, Lynch surprised fans and critics with the [[MPAA film rating system|G]]-rated, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]-produced ''[[The Straight Story]]'', which was, on the surface, a simple and humble movie telling the [[Alvin Straight|true story]] of an [[Iowa]] man ([[Richard Farnsworth]]) who rides a lawnmower to [[Wisconsin]] to make peace with his ailing brother. The film garnered positive reviews.

[[Image:MulhollandDrive.jpg|left|190px|thumb|''Mulholland Drive'' (2001)]]
The same year, Lynch approached [[ABC network|ABC]] once again with an idea for a television [[drama]]. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely.

With seven million dollars from the [[France|French]] [[film distributor|distributor]] [[Canal Plus]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film. ''Mulholland Drive'' is an enigmatic tale of the dark side of [[Hollywood]] and stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. The film performed relatively well at the [[box office]] worldwide and was a critical success earning Lynch a Best Director prize at the [[2001]] [[Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and a Best Director award from the [[New York Film Critics Association]].

In [[2002]], Lynch treated his fans to his own version of a [[sitcom]] via his [http://www.davidlynch.com website] - ''Rabbits'', eight episodes of [[surrealism]] in a rabbit suit. Later, he showed his experiments with Digital Video ([[DV]]) in the form of the Japanese style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''. 

At the [[2005]] [[2005 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], Lynch announced that he had spent over a year shooting his new film digitally in Poland. The film, titled ''[[INLAND EMPIRE (film)|INLAND EMPIRE]]'' (in capitals), included Lynch regulars such as [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Justin Theroux]], as well as [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch described the film as &quot;a mystery about a woman in trouble&quot;. It is scheduled to be released in [[2006]] and will be Lynch's first [[feature]] shot entirely on DV.

== Awards and honors ==
Lynch has twice won France's [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]] and served as President of the jury at the [[2002]] [[Cannes Film Festival]], where he had previously won the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1990]]. He was also honored in [[2002]] by the French government with the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]]. 

He has been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Directing]] three times (for ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', ''[[Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'') but has never won.

==Trivia==
* Despite his almost exclusive focus on America, Lynch, like [[Woody Allen]], has found a large audience in [[France]]; ''INLAND EMPIRE,'' ''Mulholland Drive'', ''Lost Highway'' and ''Fire Walk With Me'' were all funded through French production companies.
* Lynch is notoriously evasive and cagey in interviews, and refuses to discuss the plot details and &quot;true meanings&quot; of his films, preferring viewers to come away with their own interpretations. None of his films released on DVD have director commentary tracks, and some (rather unusually) don't even have chapter selections. This is due, at least in part, to his belief that a film should be viewed from beginning to end without interruption or distraction.
* Certain images or types of images are common trademarks in Lynch's films.  These include smoke, fire, electricity and electric lights (especially flickering or damaged), highways at night, dogs, diners, red curtains, the binding or crippling of hands or arms, various uses of the color blue, and angelic or heavenly female figures. Though interpretations do vary, those who study Lynch's work generally do find such images to represent consistent or semi-consistent themes throughout his body of work.
* Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] has been notoriously unfavorable towards Lynch, even accusing him of [[misogyny]] in his reviews of ''[[Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[Wild at Heart]]''. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19860919%2FREVIEWS%2F609190301%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F19860919%2FREVIEWS%2F609190301%2F1023&amp;AID2=] [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900817%2FREVIEWS%2F8170301%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F19900817%2FREVIEWS%2F8170301%2F1023&amp;AID2=] Ebert was one of few critics to dislike ''Blue Velvet''. He did, however, write enthusiastic reviews of ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011012/REVIEWS/110120304/1023]  and [[The Straight Story]].
* He had [[Finland|Finnish]] grandparents.
* In the 1980s Lynch was an admirer of [[Ronald Reagan]] and had dinner with the Reagans at the [[White House]]. Years later when someone made a disparaging comment about [[Nancy Reagan]] he spoke up and defended her.
* Despite his professional accomplishments, Lynch once characterized himself simply as, &quot;[[Wilson, Edward Osborne|Eagle Scout]], Missoula, Montana.&quot;[http://www.thecityofabsurdity.com/inticon.html]
*Lynch particularly enjoys cake, and a wide variety of meats.

== Transcendental meditation ==
In December 2005, Lynch told the [[Washington Post]] that he had been practicing [[transcendental meditation]] twice a day, for 20 minutes each time, for 32 years. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/01/AR2005120101798.html].  He advocates its use in bringing peace to the world. He has launched the [http://www.davidlynchfoundation.com David Lynch Foundation For Conciousness-Based Education and Peace] to fund research about TM's positive effects, and he promotes the technique and his vision by an ongoing tour of college campuses that began in September 2005. [http://www.nyunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/10/05/4349ae171a64c?in_archive=1]  (A [[streaming video]] of one of Lynch's public performances [http://www.davidlynchfoundation.com/tour/index.html is available at his foundation's website].) 

Lynch is working for the establishment of seven &quot;peace factories,&quot; each with 8000 salaried people practicing advanced techniques of TM, &quot;pumping peace for the world&quot;. He estimates the cost at $7 billion; [[as of December 2005]] he had spent $400,000 of his own money and raised $1 million in donations from a handful of wealthy individuals and organizations. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/01/AR2005120101798_2.html]

== Other interests ==
Lynch has cited the [[Austrian]] [[expressionism|expressionist painter]] [[Oskar Kokoschka]] as an inspiration for his works.  He described the twentieth century artist [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] as &quot;to me, the main guy, the number one kinda hero painter&quot;&lt;!--Lynch on Lynch, p. 16--&gt;.  He continues to present [[installation art|art installations]] and [[stage design]]s. In his spare time, he also designs and builds [[furniture]]. Lynch was also responsible for the [[comic strip]] ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]''.  

Lynch is a  big fan of [[Bob's Big Boy]] restaurants, an [[Americana]] restaurant chain whose chief icon is a cartoon male with a tray of dinner plates. Lynch has said he got a chocolate [[milkshake]] at one restaurant near his house almost every day for seven years in a row. The director credits this restaurant for helping provide the inspiration for many of his films, as his big lunches there helped him come up with ideas.

Lynch also designed [http://www.davidlynch.com/ davidlynch.com], a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short films, interviews and other items. The site also features a daily [[weather report]], where Lynch gives a brief description of the weather in [[Los Angeles]], where he resides.

'''David Paul Cronenberg''' (born [[March 15]], [[1943]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[film director]] and occasional [[actor]]. He is one of the principal originators of what is sometimes known as the &quot;[[body horror]]&quot; genre, which explores people's fears of bodily transformation and [[infection]]. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical.  In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]], although his work has long since moved beyond these genres.

He was born to a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]]-[[Jew]]ish family in [[Toronto]], Cronenberg's father was a journalist and his mother a pianist. He graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] with a degree in literature, and has cited [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as influences. 

After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black and white ''[[Stereo (film)|Stereo]]'' and the colour ''[[Crimes of the Future]]'') Cronenberg went into partnership with [[Ivan Reitman]]. The Canadian government provided finance for Cronenberg's films through the 1970s. Cronenberg alternated his signature &quot;body horror&quot; films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs. ''[[Rabid]]'' exploited the unexpected acting talents of porn queen [[Marilyn Chambers]] (Cronenberg's first choice was a young unknown called [[Sissy Spacek]]). ''Rabid'' was a breakthrough with international distributors and his next two horror features gained stronger support.

Over the arc of his career, Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression, a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in social anarchy (e.g. ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'', ''[[Rabid]]''). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. ''[[The Brood]]'', ''[[Scanners]]'', ''[[Videodrome]]''). In the later period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. Cronenberg's remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''). This trajectory culminates in ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' - arguably his greatest achievement - in which a twin pair of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] spiral into [[codependency]] and [[drug addiction]]. Cronenberg's later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (''[[eXistenZ]]'', ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'', ''[[Spider (film)|Spider]]'').

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen &quot;from the point of view of the disease&quot;, and that, for example, he identifies with the characters in ''Shivers'' '''after''' they become infected with the anarchic parasites. This perspective is illustrated in ''The Fly'' when the hero discovers that he has been genetically fused with an insect. Rather than saying &quot;My teleport machine went wrong&quot;, he says &quot;My teleport machine turned into a gene-splicer&quot;. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation. Similarly, in ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as &quot;a fertilising rather than a destructive event&quot;.

Aside from ''The Dead Zone'' (1983) and ''The Fly'', Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream [[Hollywood]] filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses.  At one stage he was considered by [[George Lucas]] as a possible director for ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' but was passed. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' but experienced &quot;creative differences&quot; with producers [[Dino de Laurentiis]] and Ronald Shusett. A different version of the film was eventually made by [[Paul Verhoeven]]. In the late 1990s Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', but this also fell through.  His most recent work, the thriller ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' (2005), is one of his highest budgeted and most mass audience-accessible to date.  He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted ''Spider'', but it is one of his most critically acclaimed films to date.

Cronenberg has hired [[Howard Shore]] to compose the [[soundtrack]] to nearly all of his films (see [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations]]). Other regular collaborators include [[actor]] Robert Silverman, [[art director]] Carol Spier, [[sound editor]] Bryan Day, [[film editor]] Ronald Sanders and, from 1979 until 1988, [[cinematographer]] Mark Irwin.

Since 1988's ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] on each of his films. Suschitzky was the director of photography for ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and Cronenberg has repeatedly said that Suschitzky's work in that film made it the most beautiful sci-fi film he'd ever seen, which was a motivating factor to work with him on ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]''. 

Cronenberg has also appeared in the films of other directors as an actor.  Most of his roles are cameo appearances, as in ''Into The Night'' or ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', but on occasion he has played major roles, as in ''[[Nightbreed]]'' or ''[[Last Night]]''. He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a [[gynaecologist]] in ''The Fly'', and he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in ''Shivers''.

In [[2002]], he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

'''Ralph Dale Earnhardt, Sr.''' (born [[April 29]], [[1951]] &amp;ndash; [[February 18]], [[2001]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[NASCAR]] driver.  He was born in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], right outside of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], to Ralph Lee Earnhardt and Martha Coleman.  He died in a racing accident in turn four of the final lap of the 2001 [[Daytona 500]].

==Early life==
Dale Earnhardt was born in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], the son of a race car driver [[Ralph Earnhardt]], who participated in the formative years of the NASCAR circuit's [[Grand National Division]] (the precursor to today's Nextel Cup Series). The allure of the racer's life attracted Dale to the sport although Ralph pushed the boy to stay in school to educate himself in hopes of avoiding the fate of being a simple [[laborer]] in one of the cotton mill's that populated the Kannapolis area. Much to his father's dismay, Dale quit school at the age of 16 to pursue racing and, as he became a young adult, to support his wife and their first son, Kerry. 

Ralph Earnhardt would die of a [[heart attack]] while working on his race car in [[1973]]. The weight of his father's death was great upon Dale's shoulders and it would take many years before his success in racing would make him feel as though he had &quot;proved&quot; himself to his father's memory.

==Racing career==
Dale Earnhardt began his [[Winston Cup]] career in 1975, making his very first start at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in the [[World 600]], located in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]]. Earnhardt drove an [[Ed Negre]] car and finished 22nd in the race. It wasn't a very promising start. Earnhardt would compete in 8 more races until, at the age of 28, got his first full time ride with Rod Osterlund Racing.

'''1979'''

Earnhardt started the [[1979]] season with car owner [[Rod Osterlund]], who had fielded a full time team for [[Dave Marcis]] with 1 win and several top 10 point finishes. The two hit it off with each other right away. They ran well at [[Daytona]] and Earnhardt notched his very first win on [[April 1st]], [[1979]], at the [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] dueling NASCAR legends [[Darrell Waltrip]] and [[Bobby Allison]]. Earnhardt ran well the rest of the year, despite missing 4 races due to a broken collarbone suffered at [[Pocono]], and would finish the year with 1 win, 11 Top 5's, 17 Top 10's, 4 poles, a 7th place points finish, and the [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]] award. 

'''1980: The First Championship'''

The dawning of a new decade in [[Winston Cup]] racing started with a bang for Dale Earnhardt as he won the [[Busch Clash]] (later renamed the [[Budweiser Shootout]]), a non-points race for all of the years previous [[Pole position|pole]] winners. But that would not be the last of his accomplishments that year. Earnhardt would get his 1st points-race win of the year at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. Earnhardt would go on to win at [[Bristol]], [[Nashville]], [[Martinsville]], and at [[Charlotte]], despite losing his [[crew chief]] midway through the year. Earnhardt went on to win his first championship, becoming the first driver to win the title the year after winning rookie of the year, the only one to accomplish that feat. Also crew chief [[Jake Elder]] left Osterlund. Jake claimed that he couldn't stand to work for any body for too long. That's how he got the nick name &quot;Suitcase Jake&quot;.

'''1981: The Lost Year'''

Osterlund sold the team to [[J.D. Stacy]] in mid-1981. While Stacy had made millions in the [[oil]] business and was determined to put a ton of money into the racing business, he just didn't have the experience to make it work and Earnhardt recognized it immediately. Earnhardt and his new owner never hit it off well and the relationship was ended as soon as possible. Earnhardt joined his future championship owner, [[Richard Childress]] to finish off the season after competing in only 4 races for Stacy. Earnhardt went winless in 1981 and finished 7th in the point standings.

'''1982: Victory Again'''

After [[Richard Childress]] convinced Dale that he didn't have the resources for the defending champion to be driving and that it wouldn't be fair to Earnhardt to go through that, Dale joined legendary car owner [[Bud Moore]] for the [[1982]] season. Earnhardt got back to victory lane at [[Darlington International Raceway]] and ended a 39 race losing streak. But that would be the only win of the year as engine failures in his [[Ford Thunderbird]] would plague their season. Earnhardt would finish 12th in the point standings, the lowest in his career (He would finish 12th again in 1992).

'''1983: On the Path to Resurgence'''

Earnhardt started the year winning at [[Daytona]]. Not the 500, but a win none the less. Earnhardt won the first of what would be 13 [[Twin-125]] Qualifiers in his career. He didn't win Daytona but did notch wins at [[Nashville]] and [[Talladega]]. He finished 8th in the point standings, but again, unreliable engines convinced Dale that Richard Childress' [[Chevrolets]] could not be worse than driving Moore's [[Fords]].

'''1984: Joining RCR'''

[[1984]] began with good news for Earnhardt, he would be going to a new home with [[Richard Childress Racing]]. Earnhardt had a good relationship with [[Bud Moore]] but simply didn't have the results he was looking for. Earnhardt, who drove for Childress in 1981, thought RCR would be the best bet. Childress, who had been receiving help from [[Junior Johnson]] the last few years, had been building up his team and finally felt he was ready for Earnhardt. Earnhardt would match the amount of wins he had in 1983, with wins at Talladega and Atlanta. But the difference in the owner change was notable, as Earnhardt led at the halfway mark in the season before ending up 4th in points.

'''1985: Short Track Dominance'''

When Earnhardt began his career, former crew chief [[Jake Elder]] and others pegged Earnhardt as a driver who would win many [[short track]] races in his career and a few [[superspeedway]] races. Well, they were half right, as Earnhardt was one of the most prolific superspeedway winners of all time. But, in 1985, they thought they had the Kannapolis, NC native pegged perfectly. Earnhardt would win 4 races, 1 at [[Richmond]], 2 at [[Bristol]], and 1 at [[Martinsville]], all short tracks. He would run respectably at the superspeedways but not consistent enough to contend for the title. His second year with Childress produced 2 more wins, but it resulted in a 8th place points finish. Childress tried to convince Dale to once again go elsewhere, but Earnhardt refused, and the results were historic.

'''1986: The Second Championship'''

1986 started on a high note for Earnhardt and the Childress team as he won the [[Busch Clash]]. If you remember, Earnhardt won the Clash in 1980, and the team took it as an omen for a possible second championship. They were correct. Earnhardt would beat [[Darrell Waltrip]] for the title, the second in his career and the first with [[Richard Childress]]. Earnhardt would also win 5 races, at [[North Wilkesboro]], 2 at Charlotte, and 1 at Atlanta. He also had two non-point races wins, the Busch Clash and the Daytona qualifier.

'''1987: The Third Championship, the End of Yellow and Blue, and the Season to Remember'''

Earnhardt's [[1987]] season started with big news, his longtime sponsor [[Wrangler]] would terminate its sponsorship at the end of the season and [[GM Goodwrench]] would take over for the [[1988]] season. Earnhardt and his team were determined to make Wrangler's last season the best; but not even they could have predicted what would happen in 1987. The team would win 11 races at [[Rockingham]], Richmond, Darlington, North Wilkesboro, Bristol, Martinsville, Charlotte, [[Michigan]], Pocono, Bristol, Darlington, and wrap it up with a win at Richmond. The team set a modern era record of 4 consecutive wins and won 5 of the first 7 races. It would have been 7 of 7 had the team not had bad luck strike at Daytona when he ran out of gas while leading with 3 to go. Earnhardt also earned his nickname &quot;The Intimidator&quot; during the [[Winston All-Star race]] at Charlotte, bullying [[Bill Elliott]] in the final segment before scoring his first of three career wins in the event.  The final, 10-lap segment featured Earnhardt's infamous, but erroneously named &quot;pass in the grass&quot;. The point race was a romp. Earnhardt grabbed it early in the year and never let up, stretching the lead at one point to greater than 600 points over Bill Elliott before beating &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; by around 400 points.

'''1988: The Man in Black'''

Earnhardt had always been an [[aggressive]], no holds bar driver his whole career. Black had always seemed perfect for the driver rather than the exact opposite colors of yellow and blue. But in 1988, Earnhardt would change the look of his car, and as a result, the view of his personality, forever. When [[GM Goodwrench]] took over the primary [[sponsorship]] role of the RCR #3 Chevy, they insisted on a black paint scheme, and soon enough, Earnhardt's newest [[nickname]] came up: The Man In Black. The season would be a great year for most, but for Earnhardt, who had won back-to-back titles and was looking to become only the 2nd man in history to win 3 consecutive titles, it was a disappointment. Earnhardt scored 3 wins and finished 3rd in the standings behind [[Bill Elliott]] and [[Rusty Wallace]].

'''1989: So Close, and Yet So Far'''

Earnhardt was determined to get back to the top of the [[Winston Cup]] heap in [[1989]], and he proved it early and often. He scored 6 wins, but this season was to belong to a budding rival. [[Rusty Wallace]] would score 5 wins en route to the championship. Earnhardt learned a lesson in points racing from [[Ricky Rudd]] at [[North Wilkesboro]], when he was racing Rudd for the win with a handful of laps to go. The smart thing to do for a title contender would be to let the man go and get the points, but Earnhardt was all about winning, and he wasn't about to let Rudd have it. The result saw the two get together and both of them spun, giving the win to [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt ended up 12th instead of 2nd, the difference in points costing him another championship. It was a lesson Earnhardt would take with him to 4 more titles.

'''1990: Redemption'''

Earnhardt couldn't wait to get back behind the wheel of the #3 GM Goodwrench [[Chevrolet Lumina]] in [[1990]]. He had something to prove after letting the 1989 Winston Cup title slip out of his grasp. The season started with another heartbreak. Earnhardt had won the outside pole for the Superbowl of Stock Car Racing, the [[Daytona 500]], and had dominated the entire speedweeks, winning the [[Bud Shootout]] and the qualifying race. On the big day, he had a 40 second lead, he had almost lapped the field, when the day's final caution came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag came out, Earnhardt was leading unknown driver [[Derrike Cope]] and was expected to take it home from there. But on the last lap, Earnhardt would have another run-in with his famous bad luck. While coming out of turn 3, Earnhardt would run over a piece of debris, cutting his tire down and giving the lead to Cope, who went on to win the race while Earnhardt finished 5th. This could have crushed a lesser team, but RCR used it as a [[motivational]] tool. They took the tire that cost them the win and mounted it to the wall of their shop to remind their team of what had happened. The results led to a 9-win season and a 4th Winston Cup title for Earnhardt, beating out [[Mark Martin]] by just 26 points for the honor. Other notable wins for Earnhardt in 1990 were the [[Southern 500]], The Winston All-Star race, and the [[Winston 500]].

In [[1991]] as Earnhardt scored his 5th Winston Cup championship. In his previous championship seasons, Earnahrdt had never scored less than 5 wins, but in 1991, Dale would score just 4 wins, but it would be more than enough as he would take the title by 195 points over [[Ricky Rudd]]. One of the biggest highlights of the season for Earnhardt was scoring the win at [[North Wilkesboro]], stealing the thunder of [[Harry Gant]], who had tied Earnhardt's mark of 4 consecutive wins and was going for a 5th but lost the brakes late in the run, giving Earnhardt the chance he needed to take the win and end Gant's streak. 

'''1992-The Wheels Fall Off'''

After back-to-back titles for the 2nd time in his career, Dale Earnhardt was determined to take advantage of the opportunity to make it 3 in a row, but again, it wasn't to be. Earnhardt's lone win of the season came at [[Charlotte]] in the prestigious [[Coca-Cola 600]], but otherwise, the season was a loss to the RCR team. Dale would finish a career-low 12th in the points for the 2nd time in his career, and the only time he had been that low since coming to RCR. Longtime RCR crew chief [[Kirk Shelmerdine]] left at the end of the year, citing burnout and wanting to pursue his own racing dream. The team would regroup with [[Andy Petree]] as the crew chief in 1993.

'''1993 Back to the Top'''

Hiring Petree turned out to be a good move, as the #3 GM Goodwrench Chevy was back up front in [[1993]]. Earnhardt once again came close to a win at the [[Daytona 500]], dominating throughout speedweeks before finishing 2nd to [[Dale Jarrett]] on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt would score 6 wins en route to his 6th Winston Cup title, including wins in prestigious races as the [[Coca-Cola 600]], the Winston All-Star race and the [[Pepsi 400]] at Daytona. Earnhardt would defeat best friend and rival [[Rusty Wallace]] for the championship by just 80 points and set about to repeating in 1994.

'''1994-7th Heaven'''

[[Richard Petty]] had been the only driver in [[NASCAR]] history to win 7 championships in NASCAR's top division, a record no one thought would be broken. In 1994, Earnhardt showed them they were wrong. Once again, Earnhardt was a model of consistency, scoring only 4 wins, but winning the title by over 400 points over [[Mark Martin]]. As Earnhardt scored his 4th title in 5 years, he seemed poised to break the record for championships and make his own mark in the history books.

'''1995-The Chase for 8'''

Dale Earnhardt started off his challenge for a record 8th Winston Cup championship the same way he always did-coming up one spot short in the Daytona 500. He finished 2nd after again dominating Speedweeks, this time to [[Sterling Marlin]]. Earnhardt wouldn't let this deter him from his goal, though. He would win 5 races in 1995, including his first career [[road course]] victory at [[Sears Point]] and the prestigious [[Brickyard 400]] at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a win he called the biggest of his career at the time. But in the end, he once again came up short of the historic 3-peat, losing the title to [[Jeff Gordon]] by just 34 points. 

'''1996-One Tough Customer'''

When Earnhardt teamed up with [[Wrangler Jeans]] to sponsor him in the 80s, their slogan for him was that he was &quot;One Tough Customer&quot;. In 1996, he showed us why. Earnhardt had his now-legendary Daytona luck, winning the pole for the Daytona 500 and dominating speedweeks again before finishing 2nd to [[Dale Jarrett]] for a 2nd time. Earnhardt won early in the year, scoring back to back victories at [[Rockingham]] and [[Atlanta]]. Coming to [[Talladega Superspeedway]], he was leading the points looking for his 8th title despite the departure of [[Andy Petree]] as crew chief. [[David Smith]] had taken the reigns of the crew chief role in 1996. A horrific accident at the track appeared to have ended his season early, let alone his title hopes. But in true Earnhardt fashion, Dale refused to sit out and raced every weekend. He had to let [[Mike Skinner]] take the wheel the first week after the accident at Indianapolis, but Earnhardt didn't like the taste of that and the following weekend at [[Watkins Glen]] he won the pole and refused to get out of the car, dominating most of the race before fatigue from his injuries caused him to slow down in which he wound up 6th. Earnhardt would not win again in 1996, but he still finished 4th in the standings behind [[Terry Labonte]], [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Dale Jarrett]]. David Smith would leave as crew chief of the #3 team at the end of the year to become team manager of the new #31 [[Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse]] RCR entry of [[Mike Skinner]] as a teammate to Earnhardt and [[Larry McReynolds]] would replace him.

'''1997-Blackout'''

In [[1997]], the black #3 was shut out of victory lane for only the 2nd time in Earnhardt's career. The lone win of the season came during speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record 8th straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of the Daytona 500 by a late crash which sent his car flipping down the backstretch. The crowd roared as he examined his car, got back into it and drove it to the finish, despite heavy damage to the car.  Earnhardt would hit the low point of the year when he would black out early in the [[Southern 500]] in [[Darlington]], causing him to hit the wall and scaring onlookers and fans. He would go to the hospital and be cleared to race, but had no idea what caused the [[blackout]]. Earnhardt would finish the season 5th in the final standings, but was obviously disappointed by their lack of results.

'''1998-FINALLY'''

Finally! The first words out of everyone's mouth when Dale Earnhardt finally scored the victory in the only jewel left from his crown. After 20 years of disappointment in the [[Daytona 500]] and dominating races only to fall to the wayside late in the going, Earnhardt finally held on and did not let go. He started Speedweeks like any other, winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race, then fielded questions from the media about his inability to win the race thus far. On race day, Dale showed himself to be one of the contenders early, leading for long periods of time. By halfway, though, it seemed that [[Jeff Gordon]] had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead, and thanks to a push by teammate [[Mike Skinner]] on lap 170 on the restart, he would not lose it. Earnhardt beat [[Bobby Labonte]] to the line to take the checkers in the race. There was a wild celebration afterward, the likes of which few races have seen since. Every crew member of every team lined [[pit road]] to slap his hand as he made his way to the coveted [[Victory Lane]] and the [[Harley Earl Trophy]]. Unfortunately, the rest of the season would not go as well for Earnhardt. He slipped to 12th in the standings by the season's halfway mark, and [[Richard Childress]] decided to make a crew chief swap, taking Mike Skinner's crew chief [[Kevin Hamlin]] and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner's team Larry Mac. The results seemed to improve, as Earnhardt climbed back to 8th in the final standings.

'''1999-BACK IN BLACK'''

[[1999]] was the year that served notice that The Intimidator had NOT gone into that good night. Everyone had started talking about Earnhardt's age and thinking that with his son [[Dale Jr]]. getting into racing that Earnhardt might start thinking [[retirement]]. Dale set out to prove them wrong, and did so with ease, scoring the sweep at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. But this season was highlighted by a much more [[controversial]] moment. At the August Bristol Night race, Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since his win at [[Martinsville]] in 1995. Earnhardt had not won a non-restrictor-plate race since 1996, and people doubted his ability to win on the short tracks, thinking he had mellowed and wasn't going to beat and bang anymore. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader [[Terry Labonte]] got hit from behind by the lapped car of [[Darrell Waltrip]]. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with 5 cars between he and Labonte with 5 laps to go. Labonte had fresher tires and Earnhardt did not. Labonte caught Earnhardt coming to the [[white flag]] and hit him 3 times to move him out of the way. Earnhardt returned the favor, but unlike Earnhardt, Labonte could not hold on. He spun, and Dale collected the win and the boos from the multitudes at the track. Earnhardt would finish 7th in the standings that year, but more importantly looked like a contender again.

'''2000-The #1 Earnhardt'''

Everyone was expecting [[2000]] to be the Year of Earnhardt, but Dale Jr., not Dale. Dale's son had moved up to the [[Winston Cup Series]] and was competing for [[Rookie of the Year]], and most expected the younger Earnhardt to outrun his father. Once again, Earnhardt proved his [[detractors]] wrong, as he scored the 2 most exciting wins of the year, winning by a foot at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] over [[Bobby Labonte]], then winning at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] after coming back from being 18th with only 5 laps to go to score his first [[No Bull]] 5 million dollar bonus. On the strength of these performances, Earnhardt took the #3 GM Goodwrench [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] to 2nd in the standings, proving to everyone that he was by no means done racing yet. He also won the battle of the Earnhardts, as Dale Jr. scored 2 wins also, but finished only 16th in the standings. 

With the season he had last year, people knew he could still get the job done. When the Daytona 500 rolled around, it seemed different. Every Speedweeks for over a decade, Dale had won at least one race before the Daytona 500. This year, Earnhardt appeared to have the qualifying race in hand but was passed by [[Sterling Marlin]] on the last lap. He finished 2nd to budding star [[Tony Stewart]] in the [[Bud Shootout]]. When the Daytona 500 started, Earnhardt appeared to have a good car, but not a dominant one. A big crash inside 25 laps to go eliminated a great deal of competition, though, and it appeared that either Earnhardt, his son or his newest hire, [[Michael Waltrip]], would win the race. Earnhardt appeared content to ride behind the two, seemingly running interference for them. When they came to the final lap, [[Sterling Marlin]] got a run under Earnhardt and tapped him in the left quarterpanel, sending him into [[Ken Schrader]], which in turn sent him into the wall headfirst. As his friend Michael and his son Dale Jr. went on to finish 1-2 in the Daytona 500, Dale's life would end. The rest of the season seemed to be a tribute to the greatest to drive a [[stock car]], with his replacement, [[Kevin Harvick]], driving a white #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy, scoring 2 wins and a 9th-place effort in the standings en route to rookie of the year. [[Steve Park]], another Earnhardt hire, won at [[Rockingham]] and appeared to have a top 10 finish in the standings secured before a serious [[head injury]] ended his season early. Dale Jr. scored 3 wins, including emotional wins at [[Daytona]] and [[Talladega]], en route to an 8th-place finish in the standings. [[Michael Waltrip]] would push his teammate and friend Dale Jr. to his win in the first race back at Daytona in July of 2001 for a [[Dale Earnhardt Inc]]. 1-2 finish at the track, for a storybook ending to a hard time for the Earnhardt camp.

Dale drove the #3 car for most of his career, spanning the early [[1980s]] until his unfortunate passing in 2001.  [[As of 2006]], no other [[Nextel Cup]] race car has used this number, but NASCAR will not officially retire it.  There is talk that Dale Earnhardt Jr. will use the number 3 towards the end of his career, and possibly even using the familiar Black paint scheme.

===Death===
[[Image:Earnhardt crash.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|The final turn of 2001's [[Daytona 500]]]]

Dale Earnhardt died on [[February 18]], [[2001]], on the last lap of the [[Daytona 500]].  Earnhardt had what many thought was the best car throughout the race, as he led 17 laps and stayed at the front of the pack. But as Earnhardt saw the way the race was developing with his two drivers, one his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and the other a man he considered a brother, Michael Waltrip, it appeared Earnhardt backed off, trying to hold the pack at bay and let his two drivers decide the outcome. He decreased his speed to block the rest of the field when, in Turn 4, he was nudged by [[Sterling Marlin]]'s bumper. It appeared Earnhardt had it saved but the car took off up the track. As it went up towards the wall it hit [[Ken Schrader]], which veered his car into a direct head on hit and severed the seat belt. Michael Waltrip went on to win his first race in over 400 races competed, and his son, Dale Jr. came in second. Earnhardt, who throughout his career let nobody get by him or stay in front of him, and did all he could to get by them including wrecking them, was killed on impact by massive head injuries trying to let another win.  Coincidentally, the crash occurred at the same place where his good friend [[Neil Bonnett]] was killed.  Because both crashes occurred as a result of a car dipping below the banking of the track onto the flat area (called the &quot;apron&quot; of the track) NASCAR implemented a new rule stating that in no instance is any car allowed to drive below the apron at Daytona, and at a similar track in [[Talladega]], [[Alabama]].  

He is survived by his third wife Teresa and four children:  Son [[Kerry Earnhardt|Kerry]] (from his first marriage to Latane Brown), Kelley, Dale Jr. (both from his second marriage to Brenda Gee), and daughter Taylor (from his third marriage). Kerry and Dale Jr. are both NASCAR drivers.  Dale Jr. finished second when his father died at the 2001 Daytona 500. The winner of that race, [[Michael Waltrip]], was one of Dale's closest friends, and drove for DEI.

Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, young California driver [[Kevin Harvick]], who was hired to replace Earnhardt in the now-renumbered and repainted #29 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet, scored a win at Atlanta.  The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television commentators' call of the final lap of the 2001 [[Golden Corral 500]], Harvick beating [[Jeff Gordon]] by .006 seconds, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime fueler, Danny &quot;Chocolate&quot; Myers, crying after the victory, are among the most memorable moments in recent [[USA|U.S.]] motorsports history. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] scored an emotional victory in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway on [[July 7]], [[2001]].

===Controversy over cause of death===
At a news conference five days after the fatal crash, NASCAR officials announced that a seat belt had broken in Earnhardt's car. [[Daytona International Speedway]] physician Dr. [[Steve Bohannon]] said he thought the faulty belt had allowed Earnhardt's chin to strike the steering wheel, causing a basilar skull fracture, killing him.  The manufacturers of seat belts for NASCAR, [[Simpson Race Products]] of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], maintained that the belt had failed because it had been installed in an unapproved fashion in order to increase Earnhardt's comfort, an allegation that had been supported by some who were familiar with the situation. 

Certainly, being held responsible for the death of NASCAR's most popular driver was not a desirable prospect for Simpson. On the other hand, NASCAR also did not wish to be seen as negligent in not requiring adequate [[HANS device|head and neck restraint]] for drivers in the wake of five fatal accidents in the past 11 months, including popular drivers [[Kenny Irwin, Jr.]], [[Tony Roper]], and [[Adam Petty]], grandson of NASCAR's legendary driver, [[Richard Petty]]. They also soon made it a requirement to wear full faced helmets (although Earnhardt had been one of the very few to still use an open face helmet).

The [[Orlando Sentinel]], particularly Sentinel sportswriter [[Ed Hinton]], attempted to acquire Earnhardt's autopsy records and photos for study, autopsy records being normally public documents in Florida, but Earnhardt's widow, Teresa, (along with public opinion) petitioned a judge to seal the records. After a short court battle, it was mutually agreed to appoint Dr. [[Barry Myers]], a [[Duke University]] expert on crash injuries, to independently study Earnhardt's death. On [[April 10]], [[2001]], Myers published his report rejecting NASCAR's explanation, finding that Earnhardt's death was in fact the result of his inadequately restrained head and neck snapping forward, independent of the broken seat belt (making the question of proper or improper installation irrelevant).

:&quot;If the outboard lap belt had remained intact throughout the crash, Mr. Earnhardt's head would still likely have experienced similar inertial forces and similar contact forces with the steering wheel. As such, the restraint failure does not appear to have played a role in Mr. Earnhardt's fatal injury.&quot; [http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-dalereporttext041001,0,6293625.story?coll=orl-home-headlines] 

Dr. [[Philip Villanueva]], a [[University of Miami]] [[neurosurgeon]] who had previously analyzed the crash for the Sentinel before the autopsy records were available, said he had reached the same conclusion, but had wanted to examine the autopsy photos to be certain. Dr. [[Steve Olvey]], medical director of [[Championship Auto Racing Teams]] for 22 years, and [[Wayne State University]] crash expert [[John Melvin]] also agreed with Myers' report. Simpson's founder, [[Bill Simpson]], called the report &quot;the best news I've heard in seven weeks. I've been living in daily hell.&quot; 

On the same day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR announced its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the accident. However, when the greatly anticipated official NASCAR report[http://www.nascar.com/SPECIAL/er/download/], which had cost over a million dollars, was published on [[August 21]], [[2001]], it cited collision with another car, the speed and angle of impact, and separation of the seat belt as factors in the fatality. After NASCAR's report, Simpson retired, citing the stress as &quot;too much.&quot; The Simpson company attorneys asked NASCAR to unequivocally assert:

*The belts were of high quality in workmanship and there were no design or manufacturing defects. 
*The belts met the NASCAR rule book requirements. 
*The belts, as installed, did not conform to manufacturer installation requirements. 
*The separation of the left lap belt was not a result of design or manufacturing defect, but caused by improper installation. 
*The belt separation was not the cause of Earnhardt's death. 

NASCAR, however, did not respond.

Consonant with its report, NASCAR declined at the time to require drivers to wear the uncomfortable [[HANS device|head and neck restraints]].  NASCAR president [[Mike Helton]] said that &quot;We are still not going to react for the sake of reacting.&quot; However, it did state that it &quot;encouraged their use.&quot; Drivers were indeed encouraged, with 41 out of 43 drivers wearing them at the [[Pepsi 400 by Meijer]] at  [[Michigan International Speedway]] on [[August 19]], [[2001]], just two days before NASCAR's report came out.

In the end, there was no controversy, as all competitors and insiders knew the truth. Before Earnhardt's death, drivers [[Kenny Irwin, Jr.|Kenny Irwin]], [[Adam Petty]], and [[Tony Roper]] had all died of basilar skull fractures due to a blunt impact with the wall delivered at a critical angle, their impacts and angles nearly identical to Earnhardt's accident.  In 1999, NASCAR mandated new rules for the cars' chassis that lessened the amount of energy the car absorbed and increased the amount of energy the driver absorbed on impact.  Leading experts all knew that, with the chassis change, lack of soft walls, and/or head and neck restraints, the configuration was a recipe for disaster.  NASCAR knew of all these concerns prior to Earnhardt's accident; however, it took the death of one of the sport's greatest stars before NASCAR finally reacted.

==Autopsy Photographs Controversy==

Dale Earnhardt's death changed Florida's laws as to who and how public record medical examiner files, to include autopsy photographs would be released to members of the public.

On or about February 19, 2001, the Volusia Country Medical Examiner (hereinafter the &quot;Medical Examiner&quot;) performed an autopsy on Dale Earnhardt's body.

During a press conference, Amy Rippel of the Orlando Sentinel made a public records request to inspect the public record autopsy records of Dale Earnhardt.

The unusual act of notifying NASCAR and Teresa Earnhardt was made prior to releasing the records sought by members of the public and media. 

Shortly thereafter, on February 22, 2001, Teresa Earnhardt, then filed a [http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010222_01_(S)_EARN-COMPLAINT_FOR_DECLAR_AND_INJUNCT_RELIEF_(05P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief] (hereinafter the &quot;Injuction&quot;) in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Volusia County, Florida (Case No. 2001-30373-CICI Div. 32) (hereinafter &quot;Earnhardt v. Volusia&quot;).

The attorneys who filed the Injunction in Earnhardt v. Volusia included Laurence Bartlett, of Crotty &amp; Bartlett, P.A., 1800 W. International Speedway Blvd., Daytona Beach, Florida 32114 (hereinafter &quot;Crotty and Bartlett&quot;).

At the time, Crotty and Bartlett were the attorneys for the International Speedway Corporation (i.e., owners of NASCAR and the Daytona International Speedway).

Once the [http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010222_01_(S)_EARN-COMPLAINT_FOR_DECLAR_AND_INJUNCT_RELIEF_(05P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief] was filed, the Medical Examiner was barred from releasing the public records pertaining to 
Dale Earnhardt, to include autopsy photographs, until a formal hearing on the merits of Teresa Earnhardt's [http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010222_01_(S)_EARN-COMPLAINT_FOR_DECLAR_AND_INJUNCT_RELIEF_(05P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief] could be heard.

On February 28, March 13, and March 16, 2001, the Orlando Sentinel (&quot;Sentinel&quot;), Michael Uribe, Founder of [http://www.websitecity.com WebsiteCity.com] (&quot;Uribe&quot;), and Campus Communications, Inc., publisher of The Independent Florida Alligator (&quot;CCI&quot;), 
filed motions to intervene into the Earnhardt v. Volusia litigation 
in order to uphold their rights to inspect and copy public records 
held by the Volusia County Medical Examiner to include the photographs and videotape of Dale Earnhardt's autopsy examination.
(See, copies of these pleadings filed by the Sentinel, Uribe and CCI at
[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010228_01_(S)_SENTINEL-MOT_TO_INTERV_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Sentinel Motion to Intervene], 
[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010313_01_(F)_URIBE-MOT_TO_INTERV_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf Uribe Motion to Intervene], and
[http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/research/court/circuit-CN-2001-30373-CICI/pleadings/docs/20010316_04_CCI-MOT_TO_INTERV_DISM_SUM_JUDG_(03P)(EARNvME)2001-30373.pdf CCI Motion to Intervene]
respectively).

On June 12-13, 2001, a trial would then be conducted before the Honorable Judge Joseph Will.  Judge Will eventually ruled against Uribe and CCI's original public records requests and constitutional arguments to inspect and copy the medical examiner files pertaining to Dale Earnhardt, to include autopsy photographs.

Judge Will's ruling set forth in motion an extensive legal battle later fought in the appellate courts by both Uribe and CCI seeking to deam the denial of their public record's request unconstitutional under Florida State and Federal laws.

Then on December 1, 2003, the United States Supreme Court denied to hear Uribe and CCI's appeal to their court (See original [http://www.earnhardtinvestigation.com/earnhardt/courts/CCI_v_EARN_US03-0484/pleadings/docs/20030929_01-CCI-PETITION-FOR-WRIT-OF-CERTIORARI_(93P)(CCIvEARN)(US03-0484).pdf Petition for Writ of Certiorari].  Thus, Florida Governor Jeb Bush's March 29, 2001 law preventing release of Dale Earnhardt's public record autopsy photographs would remain in effect.

Governor Jeb Bush's March 29, 2001 law, also known as the Earnhardt Family Protection Act, changed Florida's previously long standing and historically open public records laws from that day onward.  The law deemed Florida's medical examination autopsy photographs, video and audio recordings exempt from public inspection without the expressed permission from applicable next of kin.

==Legacy==
Dale Earnhardt in NASCAR was a very polarizing figure.  People either loved him or hated him, but he was one of the most popular drivers in the sport.  Earnhardt's death drew a considerable reaction from the nation, NASCAR, and of course grief-stricken fans.  It is remarkable, and almost symbolic, that his son, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Dale Jr.]], is still officially marked as &quot;Earnhardt Jr.&quot; on the ticker, even though there is no longer a need to distinguish between father and son on the racetrack.

Earnhardt kept his private life generally private. He enjoyed the company of his family, being in the outdoors, hunting and fishing, and actively working his farm in Kannapolis, riding a tractor instead of a racecar. In contrast with his image as a hardnosed competitor on the track, off the track he was known to his friends as someone who was charitable and generous, but kept that side of himself private from the rest of the world. 

Earnhardt has a street in his hometown of Kannapolis named after him.  Dale Earnhardt Boulevard (originally Earnhardt Road) is marked as Exit 60 off of [[Interstate 85]], northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]].  A road between Kannapolis and [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]], along which is the headquarters of DEI, has been given the designation [[North Carolina State Road 3|State Road 3]] by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.  In addition, Exit 73 off of [[Interstate 35W]], one of the entrances to [[Texas Motor Speedway]], is named &quot;Dale Earnhardt Way&quot;.

Earnhardt appeared in a [[cameo]] role in the [[1998 in film|1998]] comedy spoof ''[[BASEketball]]'' as a taxi driver, who reveals himself only after [[Yasmine Bleeth]]'s character asks the driver if he &quot;can go any faster,&quot; complete with the famous forward-slanted 3 painted on the side.

In 2000, the [[Piedmont Boll Weevils]] [[minor league baseball]] team was renamed to the [[Kannapolis Intimidators]] after Earnhardt purchased a share in the team's ownership.

In [[2004]], Dale Earnhardt's life story was made into a [[television movie]] by [[ESPN]] titled, ''[[3: The Dale Earnhardt Story]]''.

Since Earnhardt's death, NASCAR has worked hard to improve driver safety.  The HANS device, Safer Barriers and other devices have been inacted on the track.

Dale Earnhardt will be inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] on April 27, 2006.

In 2004 Keith Bryant released the album &quot;Riding with the Legend,&quot; with the title track being a tribute to Dale Earnhardt based on [[David Allan Coe]]'s &quot;The Ride(The Ghost of [[Hank Williams]])&quot;

==Dune==

''Main article :'' ''[[Dune (Cryo)|Dune]]''

{{Infobox CVG| title = Dune
|image = [[Image:Dune cryo.png|240px]]
|developer = [[Cryo Interactive]]
|publisher = [[Cryo Interactive]]
|released = [[1992]]
|genre = [[Strategy game]]
|modes = [[Single Player]]
|platforms = [[MS-DOS]], [[Amiga]]
}}
''Dune'' blended adventure with economic and military strategy, and is considered by many the most immersive Dune computer game. Loosely following the story of the novel, the game casts the player as [[Paul Atreides]], with the ultimate goal of driving the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] from Dune, while managing [[melange|spice]] extraction, military, and later, ecology through the native [[Fremen]] tribes. As the player progresses, his troops are equipped with weapons from crysknives to Atomics, tap into Paul's latent psychic powers, and get acquainted with such characters from the book as [[Chani]] and [[Liet-Kynes|Liet Kynes]]. Available for the [[Amiga]] and [[IBM PC|IBM compatibles]], it was one of the first floppy games to be converted to CD format, which included footage of the [[David Lynch]] movie, and highly improved, 3D-rendered travelling and location screens. This version (a mix of the Amiga graphics and the extras of the PC-CD version) was also released on [[Sega]]'s Mega CD format. Also worthy of mention is the audio track created by [[Stéphane Picq]] and [[Philip Ulrich]], released by Cryo (formerly Exxos) on the now extremely rare album [[Dune: Spice Opera]].

==Dune II==
{{main|Dune II}}
Also known as:
*''Dune II: The Battle for Arrakis'' ([[Sega Genesis]] port)
*''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty''

While not the first [[real-time strategy]] game, per se (the first being [[Stonkers]]), Dune II established a format that would be followed for years to come. As such, Dune II is considered the founder (or simply &quot;the daddy&quot;) of the [[real-time strategy|RTS]] genre. Striking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for the coming [[Command and Conquer]] (which was nicknamed &quot;Dune III&quot; by fans and detractors alike), [[Warcraft]], and the RTS craze that endures to this day.

The player takes the role of a commander of one of three interplanetary houses, the [[House Atreides|Atreides]], the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] or the [[House Ordos|Ordos]], with the objective of wresting control of [[Arrakis]] from the two other houses. The basic strategy in the game is to harvest the [[melange|spice]] from the treacherous sand dunes, convert the spice into spendable credits via a harvester and refinery and to build military combat units with these acquired credits in order to fend off and destroy the enemy.  In addition to enemy incursions, the player must also deal with periodic appearances of the [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]], capable of swallowing vehicles and infantry whole, as well as and harsh weather conditions that can deteriorate the structures of the player's base.

==Dune 2000==
{{Infobox CVG| title = Dune 2000
|image = [[Image:Dune 2000 (Game).jpg|240px]]
|developer = [[Westwood Studios]]
|publisher = [[Virgin Interactive]]
|released = [[1998]]
|genre = [[Strategy game]]
|modes = [[Single Player]]
|platforms = [[MS-DOS]]
}}
Using a game engine which resembles Westwood's ''[[Red Alert (computer game)|Red Alert]]'', ''Dune 2000'' is a remake of ''Dune 2''. The story, told with animations and subtitles in the original Dune 2, is now told with [[full motion video]] starring actors such as [[John Rhys-Davies]]. The game was criticised by some for not adding enough fresh content, and for an inferior interface compared to its competitors &amp;mdash; most notably ''[[Total Annihilation]]''. The storyline, though, has improved markedly as did the triggers in-game with excellent twists to the gameplay. The game also tidied its graphics to incorporate 16-bit graphics as well as incorporating a later patch with new units for multiplay. Despite all these enhancements, the game suffered from poor AI behaviour as well as poor waypointing which has quickly become crucial in fast and furious online multiplayer games.

==Emperor: Battle for Dune==
{{Infobox CVG| title = Emperor: Battle for Dune
|image = [[Image:EmperorScreenshot.jpg|240px]]
|developer = [[Westwood Studios]]
|publisher = [[EA Games]]
|released = [[2001]]
|genre = [[Strategy game]]
|modes = [[Single Player]], [[Multiplayer]]
|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]]
}}

{{details|Emperor: Battle for Dune}}
While having an interface similar to the ''[[Command and Conquer]]'' series, it added enough features - such as a [[Game engine|3D engine]] and in-battle reinforcements - to provide an interesting change of pace. Features of note are the fairly non-linear campaign, featuring randomized events, and the fast pace relative to the earlier Dune games. The three Houses also featured new units in their ranks, with new abilities.

Criticisms of the game are not as much as that of its predecessor, Dune 2000 but it still suffered from poor AI with the computer controlled player attacking the human player with a similar strategy that can be predicted and thereafter countered effectively. Further, the game's bad AI includes a lack of combining units of different abilities as the missions cannot be won by building only a particular type of combat unit.

Like Dune 2000, the game featured all new full-motion video cutscenes, somewhat based more on the original movie. The most notable inclusions were those of the roles of the Duke Achillus of [[House Atreides]] being played by ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Michael Dorn]].

==Frank Herbert's Dune==
([[Cryo Interactive]], [[2001]])

[[Image:FH Dune Game.jpg|thumb|right|240px|&quot;Frank Herbert's Dune&quot; PC game by Cryo Interactive (2001)]]

Based on the [[Sci Fi Channel|Sci-Fi Channel]] TV Series, ''Frank Herbert's Dune'' was an effort to create a 3D action game in the [[Dune (novel)|Dune]] universe. The game was not a commercial or critical success, and was the last product by Cryo Interactive. The studio went bankrupt shortly after the game flopped.

As Paul, the son of the Duke Atreides's concubine and heir to the throne, you must earn the trust and respect from the natives of the planet Dune, the Fremen, to ultimately become their propehsied Messiah, Muad'Dib. You will have to free them from the desolate conditions their home planet is in. Done that, there still is the evil Lord Harkonnen, who, with covert backup from the Emperor, slaughtered your family.

The story behind each mission is accurate to the world of the novels although they took place during the Two Year span in Dune where Paul gains the Fremen's trust.

Some concepts of the gameplay were innovative. Such as the use of a Life Gauge and a Water Gauge, when the Life Gauge is empty you die but health can be restored at any point before that by drinking Water. This meant that the player had to time his drinks carefully to coincide with when he could next gain another drink.  Another interesting concept was that if the player was able to stealthily sneak up on an enemy and attack him unawares, not only would he be dispatched without using any ammunition or taking any damage, but the player would also steal some of his water. Unfortunately this led to an incredibly steep learning curve which made an already awkward to play game almost impossible in some sections.

==Dune Generations==

[[Image:Dune_generations_screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|240px|&quot;Dune Generations&quot; by CryoNetworks (2001)]]
[[Image:Dune_generations_logo.gif|left|120px|Dune Generations Logo]]

[[Cryo_Interactive|Cryonetworks]] in 2001 revealed Dune Generations, its upcoming online real-time strategy game based on Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novel series. The company launched an official Web site for the upcoming game that features some concept images, a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld, and a list of frequently asked questions. Dune Generations was scheduled for release at the end of 2001.

Dune Generations will let players assume control of a dynasty in the Dune universe. The goal of the game is to build the dynasty into the most powerful family in the universe and gain control of the planet Arrakis, the source of the most precious substance in the universe: spice. Players can choose to control one of three types of dynasties--traders, soldiers, or mercenaries--and each dynasty type provides a different playing experience.

At the beginning of 2002 Cryo's closure was announced, due to a failure to negotiate a deal with the company's creditors. Cryo was the publisher behind the upcoming massively multiplayer online sci-fi role-playing game Dune Generations. A number of other Cryo games have been published in North America through a partnership with Canada-based DreamCatcher Interactive.

'''Vladimir Harkonnen''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.

{{spoiler}}

Born in the year 10,110 after the foundation of the [[Spacing Guild]]. His father served as head to the [[House Harkonnen]] and as Siridar (planetary governor) and [[Baron]] of the [[planet]] [[Giedi Prime]]. Vladimir was trained since youth as a possible successor to him. Vladimir presumably proved to be the most promising candidate as he was eventually chosen over his younger half-brother [[Abulurd Harkonnen]].

Abulurd eventually married into [[House Rabban]] and renounced the name Harkonnen and his rights to the title. Under the name [[Abulard Harkonnen|Abulurd Rabban]] he reigned as [[Count]] and governor of planet [[Lankiveil]]. Vladimir was uncle to his sons: [[Glossu Rabban]] (year 10,132 - 10,193), nicknamed Beast Rabban, and [[Feyd-Rautha]] Rabban (year 10,174 - 10,193). Vladimir later adopted them back into House Harkonnen and the latter became his designated heir as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

Vladimir never married and his homosexuality was additionally something of an open secret. This, however, did not prevent at least two sexual encounters with a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], . Blackmailed into supporting their elaborate and covert breeding program, the Baron was forced to father an offspring which was to be raised on the Bene Gesserit homeworld of Wallach IX. Ironically, this child would later become the Lady [[Jessica Atreides]]. Thus, the Baron Harkonnen was also a biological ancestor of Paul Atreides and his line, including the God Emperor Leto II. 

Vladimir was a skillful, if ruthless, [[politician]] with an apparent talent for manipulating people and events towards his chosen ends. During his reign the House Harkonnen progressively gained in both wealth and power. His major sources of wealth were his dominance in the [[whale]] [[fur]] [[market]] and his control of the [[Melange]]-producing  [[planet]] [[Arrakis]].
The Baron was able to [[finance]] elaborate political schemes that further added to his power. For several years he was assisted by the [[sadist]]ic [[mentat]] [[Piter De Vries]]. Much of his success at political maneuvering was due to a ruse that he was rash and overtly brutal, using such overtures to mask his subtler primary plots.

The Baron's most prominent political rival was his distant cousin [[Leto Atreides]], head of  [[House Atreides]] and [[Duke]] of [[planet]] [[Caladan]]. The true heritage of the Duke's consort, Lady Jessica, was unknown by either. In year 10,176, his grandson [[Paul Atreides]] was born.

In year 10,191, Vladimir was apparently contacted by [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], 81st [[Emperor]] of [[House Corrino]] with the proposal of an alliance against the Duke. Vladimir was content in accepting, although uncertain of the Emperor's motivation. 

Leto was pressured to surrender Caladan to Vladimir and receive Arrakis instead. He complied, though he sent a small invasion force, really no more than a raid, against Geidi Prime. 

Shortly after this, a much larger invasion force arrived on Arrakis, consisting of both [[Sardaukar]] and Harkonnen forces. The Sardaukar were disguised by Harkonnen uniforms, so that outsiders would not recognize the hand of the Emperor in destroying Duke Leto. The Duke had not yet had time to establish a solid presence on Arrakis, and soon most of the Duke's [[army]] was slain. 

The Baron Harkonnen was known for his creativity.  This showed itself in the war against the Duke Leto, when the Harkonnen soldiers fought the Atreides at one point with old-fashioned explosive [[artillery]].  While artillery and [[firearms]] were generally worthless against the [[Holtzman effect]] '''shields''' that were commonplace in the Empire, shields were not used on Arrakis and the Baron calculated that the Atreides soldiers would retreat to caves.  The artillery sealed them in, causing the Atreides soldiers to die by the thousands of suffocation and starvation.  This tactic greatly reduced Harkonnen and Sardaukar casualties. It is not known if the Baron had studied the ancient history of humankind, but the Baron's re-introduction of a weapon that was obsolete since the days of Old Earth helped him achieve a crushing victory. 

Vladimir had arranged for the Duke to be taken prisoner by Dr. [[Wellington Yueh]], his own [[physician]]. But Yueh had personal reasons to hate Vladimir. A [[tooth]] of the captive was filled with [[poison]]ous [[gas]] intended to kill him and those around him. The Baron survived Yueh's  [[assassination]] attempt but Piter De Vries did not. He was replaced with [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Mentat]] to the deceased Duke, under duress. Vladimir apparently managed to convince Hawat that they could join forces against the Emperor.

The following two years saw Vladimir becoming increasingly aware that both of his nephews were conspiring against him to obtain the Baron's throne. The Baron let them continue to do so, reasoning that they had to somehow learn to organize a [[conspiracy]]. However as punishment for a failed [[assassination]] attempt against him, Vladimir forced Feyd-Rautha to single-handedly slaughter all the female [[Slavery|slave]]s who served as his [[lover]]s, while the Baron watched. He explained that Feyd-Rautha had to learn the price of failure.

By year 10,193, the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] had managed to gain a series of victories against Beast Rabban and to capture most of the territory of the planet, which threatened to disrupt the trade of [[Melange]]. The Emperor decided to take control of the situation and arrived on Arrakis along with ten legions of Sardaukar forces. Vladimir and Feyd-Rautha escorted him with a vastly larger Harkonnen army, made up mostly of conscripts but also containing seasoned Harkonnen troops.

Vladimir was shocked to learn that Paul Atreides led the Fremen. The imperial forces fell prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen. Part of the Fremen/Atreides strategy was to wait until a sandstorm shorted out the force field shields of the Harkonnen/Imperial transport ships, disable them with projectile weapons, and then attack with a vast assault force, using Sandworms under cover of the severe weather to break the enemy lines.  The Sardaukar and Harkonnen forces were trapped on the planet, astonished at the Sandworm mounts and vast numbers of their attackers, and their past ruthlessness gave them little hope of quarter from the enraged Fremen. 

Beast [[Rabban]] died in the initial part of the battle. The Harkonnen army was massacred to the last man, almost all the 300,000 Imperial Sardaukar died, and Vladimir was poisoned by [[Alia Atreides]], his own granddaughter, and took his last breath at the age of 83. Feyd-Rautha was killed by Paul in a duel. The death of the three men and the massacre meant the end of [[House Harkonnen]] as a galactic power. But, since grandson Paul subsequently was named emperor, Vladimir's descendants would long reign as the Imperial [[House Atreides]].

The Baron's story does not end with his death however. Paul's sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] was born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the [[Bene Gesserit]] call [[abomination]], because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by one of their ancestors. Alia falls victim to this prediction and initially shares control of her body with the Baron, gradually falling under his power. At the end of [[Children of Dune]] Alia commits suicide, in part because she realizes the Baron has virtually surpassed her abilities to contain him.


== Appearance ==

Frank Herbert's representation of the Baron Harkonnen portrays him as an imposing, powerful man. His eyes are described as &quot;spider-like&quot; and his voice a deep, rumbling basso with a style of dress often including a flowing robe and a collection of rings adorning large hands. The original explanation for his excessive weight was simply attributed to overindulgence. This was later retconned by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson in their first prequel trilogy, explaining that the Baron was once an exceedingly handsome young man, possessing a near-perfect physique. In this version, his bodily deterioration is said to be the result of a rare disease caused by Jessica's mother, a Bene Gesserit named Gaius Helen Mohiam, in punishment for the Baron's actions leading to her pregnancy. After which, his physique began to slowly atrophy into the obese one. In Dune: House Harkonnen, he at first walked with the assistance of a cane, then relied on belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility. He tried to force Mohiam to reveal the means to reverse the disease, but doesn't succeed, for the affliction was uncurable. In all instances, he displays extreme intelligence and carries an air of ruthless cruelty. 

In David Lynch's 1984 box-office flop, he was played by Kenneth McMillan. In addition to being grotesquely overweight, he was shown to be covered in large, black pustules which required constant draining and treatment. He is further displayed as a raving lunatic, screaming and laughing incoherently at any given moment and going so far as to drink the blood of a servant after removing a &quot;heart plug.&quot; None of these features are ever mentioned or assumed in the book and are admittedly attributed to Lynch's inspiration from [[Star Wars]] character [[Jabba the Hutt]] who had appeared in [[Return of the Jedi]] the year before. Lynch had previously turned down the offer to direct Jedi in favor of Dune.

The latest incarnation of this character appeared in a 2000 miniseries produced by the Sci-Fi Channel. Perhaps in attempt to move from McMillan's portrayal, the Baron is played by British actor [[Ian McNeice]] and is given a much lighter tone. While still said to possess the ruthlessness of Herbert's creation, he is nonetheless shown to be somewhat effeminate in nature. Among the most frequently cited criticisms are his overly flamboyant robes, his lack of vocal command, and a tendency to speak in rhyming verse (iambic pentameter) at the close of each scene, considered ridiculous by many fans. Nevertheless, this portrayal is generally thought to be far closer to Herbert's creation and is considered an improvement over his previous film depiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Piter De Vries''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (novel)|Dune]] [[science fiction]] series. 

{{spoiler}}

== History ==
Piter was a &quot;twisted&quot; [[mentat]] in the service of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]]. This mentat was a particular favorite of the Baron because the [[Tleilaxu]] had made his amoral character obvious through his [[sadistic]] nature and role as torturer for the Baron.

== Personality ==
Piter's loyalty to his master is unusual in that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm, even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm Piter's suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him. This twisted mentat is more sadistic and cruel than most. 

Note: De Vries pioneered a type of poison called &quot;residual toxin&quot; , which remains in one's body for years.  One such fatal poison was used by Baron Harkonnen on [[Thufir Hawat]], in order to keep the Mentat's allegiance by being the only provider of the antidote (which only stays the effects of the poison, and does not remove it from the body).

== More information ==
Piter is generally regarded as architect of the plan to destroy the Harkonnen's long-time enemy, [[House Atreides]], while returning the Baron's stewardship over [[Arrakis]].  Piter died on Arrakis shortly after House Harkonnen's troops and Imperial [[Sardaukar]] had captured Duke [[Leto Atreides]]. He was killed by Leto, who had been given a false tooth by [[Wellington Yueh]], the Suk doctor who betrayed House Atreides. When the tooth was crushed, a poisonous gas was released. The attack was meant to kill the Baron, but failed.

Unknown to most, there are actually two ghola-mentats who assume this identity in the Dune universe. The original Piter De Vries was secretly killed by Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], as depicted in [[Dune: House Corrino]]. This occurred after the mentat discovered the Harkonnen heritage of Lady Jessica and newly born Paul Atreides, attempting to kidnap the infant as ransom. Mohiam effectively preserved this secret by murdering De Vries and arranging for his corpse to be shipped home to [[Giedi Prime]]. An enraged Baron was left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax, who would become the mentat popularly featured in Herbert's original [[Dune (novel)|Dune]]. This has caused some consternation among many who cite inconsistencies between the prequel and original series. However, both versions of this character continue to be popular among casual and die-hard fans alike.

In [[David Lynch]]'s Dune [[Dune (film)|film]], Piter was played by [[Brad Dourif]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diffie-Hellman key exchange''' is a [[cryptographic protocol]] which allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret [[key (cryptography)|key]] over an insecure [[communication]]s channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a [[symmetric key]] [[cipher]].

Synonyms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange include:
*'''Diffie-Hellman key agreement'''
*'''Diffie-Hellman key establishment'''
*'''Diffie-Hellman key negotiation'''
*'''exponential key exchange'''

The scheme was first published publicly by [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]] in [[1976]], although it later emerged that it had been discovered a few years earlier within [[GCHQ]], the British signals intelligence agency, by [[Malcolm J. Williamson]] but was kept classified. In [[2002]], Hellman suggested the algorithm be called '''Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange''' in recognition of [[Ralph Merkle]]'s contribution to the invention of [[public-key cryptography]] (Hellman, 2002).

Although Diffie-Hellman key agreement itself is an ''anonymous'' (non-''authenticated'') [[key agreement]] protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide [[perfect forward secrecy]] in [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]'s ephemeral modes.

==History of the protocol==
Diffie-Hellman key agreement was invented in [[1976]] during a collaboration between Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman and was the first practical method for establishing a shared secret over an unprotected communications channel. [[Ralph Merkle]]'s work on public key distribution was an influence.  [[John Gill (cryptographer)|John Gill]] suggested application of the [[discrete logarithm]] problem.  It had been discovered by Malcolm Williamson of [[GCHQ]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] some years previously, but GCHQ chose not make it public until [[1997]], by which time it had no influence on research in [[academia]].

The method was followed shortly afterwards by [[RSA]], another implementation of public key cryptography using [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric algorithms]].

In [[2002]], Martin Hellman wrote:
:&quot;''The system...has since become known as Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called 'Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange' if names are to be associated with it.  I hope this small pulpit might help in that endeavor to recognize Merkle's equal contribution to the invention of public key cryptography.''&quot; [http://www.comsoc.org/livepubs/ci1/public/anniv/pdfs/hellman.pdf]

{{US patent|4,200,770}}, now expired, describes the algorithm and credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.

==Description==
The simplest, and original, implementation of the protocol uses the [[multiplicative]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] of integers modulo ''p'', where ''p'' is [[prime number|prime]] and ''g'' is [[primitive root modulo n|primitive]] mod ''p''.  Modulo (or mod) simply means that the integers between 1 and ''p'' &amp;minus; 1 are used with normal multiplication, exponentiation and division, except that after each operation the result keeps only the remainder after dividing by ''p''.  Here is an example of the protocol:

|}
Both Alice and Bob have arrived at the same value, because ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;ba&lt;/sup&gt;'' are equal.  Note that only ''a'', ''b'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt; = g&lt;sup&gt;ba&lt;/sup&gt;'' are kept secret.  All the other values are sent in the clear.  Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.
Of course, much larger values of ''a'',''b'', and ''p'' would be needed to make this example secure, since it is easy to try all the possible values of ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod 23 (there will be, at most, 22 such values, even if ''a'' and ''b'' are large).  If ''p'' was a prime of more than 300 digits, and ''a'' and ''b'' were at least 100 digits long, then even the best known algorithms for finding ''a'' given only ''g'', ''p'', and ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''p'' (known as the [[discrete logarithm problem]]) would take longer than the lifetime of the universe to run.  ''g'' need not be large at all, and in practice is usually either 2 or 5.

Here's a more general description of the protocol:

# Alice and Bob agree on a finite [[cyclic group]] ''G'' and a [[Generating set of a group|generating]] element ''g'' in ''G''.  (This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; ''g'' is assumed to be known by all attackers.) We will write the group ''G'' multiplicatively.
# Alice picks a random [[natural number]] ''a'' and sends ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; to Bob.
# Bob picks a random natural number ''b'' and sends ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; to Alice.
# Alice computes (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;.
# Bob computes (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Both Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; which can serve as the shared secret key. The values of (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; and (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; are the same because groups are [[Power-associativity|power associative]].  (See also [[exponentiation]].)

Note: It should be difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key or for Bob to solve for Alice's private key. If it isn't difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), Eve may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key. Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key).

==Security==
The protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly.  The eavesdropper (&quot;[[Alice and Bob|Eve]]&quot;) must solve the [[Diffie-Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is currently considered difficult.  An efficient algorithm to solve the [[Discrete logarithm problem|discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie-Hellman problem, making this protocol insecure.

The [[Glossary of group theory|order]] of ''G'' should be prime or have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig-Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''.  For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate ''p=2q+1'', called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''.  ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''.

If Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random but can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.

The secret integers ''a'' and ''b'' are discarded at the end of the [[session (computer science)|session]].
Therefore, Diffie-Hellman key exchange by itself trivially achieves [[perfect forward secrecy]] because no long-term private keying material exists to be disclosed.  

===Authentication===
In the original description, the Diffie-Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the parties, and is thus vulnerable to [[man in the middle attack]]. The man-in-the-middle may establish two distinct Diffie-Hellman keys, one with Alice and the other with Bob, and then try to masquerade as Alice to Bob and/or vice-versa, perhaps by decrypting and re-encrypting messages passed between them. Some method to authenticate these parties to each other is generally needed.

A variety of cryptographic authentication solutions incorporate a Diffie-Hellman exchange. When Alice and Bob have a [[public key infrastructure]] they may digitally sign the agreed key, or ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, as in [[MQV]], [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]] and the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] component of the [[IPsec]] protocol suite for securing [[Internet Protocol]] communications. When Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a [[password-authenticated key agreement]] form of Diffie-Hellman.

'''''Destry Rides Again''''' is a [[1939]] [[western film]] directed by George Marshall, starring [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]], [[Mischa Auer]],  [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Bill Cody, Jr.]], and [[Una Merkel]].

This is both a comedy and a drama, about how a corrupt and violent town can be cleaned up without relying entirely on physical force. It demonstrates the power the cooperation between men and women, as well as what can be done by putting respect for the law over reliance on brawn.

{{spoiler}}
Characters:
*Kent - saloon owner
*Slade - mayor
*Callahan - henpecked Russian
*Frenchy - the saloon singer
*Wash - new sheriff
*Destry - new deputy
[[Image:destry.jpg|thumb|left|James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich ]]
The film opens to the usual drunken men's brawl, but outside the tavern rather than in. We then watch the saloon owner and Frenchy (Dietrich) cheat a man out of his ranch. Frenchy spills coffee on the man when he gleefully bets his $10,000 ranch with an unbeatable poker hand. Kent's stooge replaces the man's ace in the hole with a deuce. When Sheriff Keho goes up to investigate, Kent's gang murders him and hides his body. The mayor announces that Keho has suddenly gone away on business and picks the banjo playing town drunk to be the new sheriff. Unexpectedly, this former deputy of the great Destry suddenly swears off drinking: &quot;You gotta choose between the bottle or the badge&quot;. He announces that he's sending for Tom Destry, Junior who cleaned up Tombstone.

A cattleman and his sister ride on the 6-horse stage along with Tom. The hot-headed cattleman complains about the bumpy ride, while his sister says she doesn't mind at all. Tom watches with calm, almost amused detachment. He then deflates Jack with a homespun anecdote about a violent man who went up against the wrong person one day, and is now pushing up the prettiest flowers in his hometown cemetery. 

Kent introduces himself as a man with an unusual hobby - taking deputy's guns - and the other men edge cautiously away, but Destry defuses the situation by announcing he doesn't carry a gun. But people are not disappointed because a big fight does indeed break out: it's a cat fight over Callahan between his wife and Frenchy: &quot;You know he'd rather be cheated by me than married to you.&quot; It lasts over two minutes and is broken up by Destry pouring water over the two women. It's a running joke that Callahan is treated like a pouting boy by his domineering wife.

Destry believes in law and order, but not in guns. This is the paradox of the film. A casual observer might think he was a pacifist. But he does believe in using force, just not in violent shoot-outs. A violent confrontation makes the bad guys look like heroes somehow, but locking them up in jail makes them look cheap and serves as a warning to the rest. 

Destry is actually the most forceful man in town. When the sheriff talks of quitting, because Destry refuses to challenge the bad guys with guns a-blazing, Destry grabs his shoulder and turns him around. &quot;You're not going back to being the town drunk!&quot; He makes him swear him in. When three horsemen come in, shooting their pistols for fun, Destry tells them to hold on. One man calls him &quot;No Gun Destry&quot;, but he asks if he can heft the other's guns. He then shoots the knobs off a sign and angrily tells the much subdued gun owner, &quot;The next time, I'll put you in jail.&quot;

Destry stops another gun fight by siding with Kent against Claggett, the man he cheated, and permits Kent to throw Claggett off the ranch he worked ten years for. &quot;We gotta respect the law. No two ways about it, right?&quot; He also visits Frenchy &quot;to apologize&quot; (but really to appeal to her better nature).

He gives Callahan a pair of pants to help locate Keogh's body. No pacifist, Destry punches out Jack when he insultingly accuses him of accepting bribes from Kent.



The film has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

A western with a very similar plot and similar comic effects is [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[Dodge City (1939 movie)|Dodge City]]''.


A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theater|musical]] version of the story, ''Destry Rides Again,'' opened in [[New York]] at the [[Imperial Theater]] on [[April 23]], [[1959 in music|1959]], and played 472 performances.  Produced by [[David Merrick]], the show had music and lyrics by [[Harold Rome]] and starred [[Andy Griffith]] as Destry and [[Dolores Gray]] as Frenchy.  Obviously influenced by having played the role of Destry, when [[Andy Griffith]] became the star on The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968), the main character, Andy Taylor, was a sherrif who carried no gun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Denmark}}
'''Politics of Denmark''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democratic]] [[constitutional monarchy]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with the prime minister acting as the [[first among equals]] (''[[primus inter pares]]''). [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the Danish [[parliament]], known as the ''[[Folketing]]''. In the last decennia the party system is dominated by the market liberal [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] party and the social democratic [[Socialdemokraterne|Social Democrats]].
The [[courts of Denmark|Danish Judiciary]] is functionally and administratively independent of the executive and the legislature.

== Executive branch ==
[[Denmark]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[List of Danish monarchs|almost unbroken link of monarchs]] for more than 1,000 years (except for an interregnum of eight years from [[1332]] to [[1340]]). The current monarch, [[Margaret II of Denmark|Queen Margaret II]], has largely ceremonial functions; perhaps her most significant formal power lies in her right to appoint the [[Prime Minister|prime minister]] ''(Statsminister)'' and the [[cabinet of Denmark]], who are responsible for administration of the government. However, she must consult with parliamentary leaders to determine the public's will, since the cabinet may be dismissed by a [[vote of no confidence]] in the ''[[Folketing]],'' the Danish parliament. Cabinet members are occasionally recruited from outside the ''Folketing.''
The vote of no confidence is an essential part of danish parliamentary work, since the constitution states &quot;no government can work with a majority against it&quot;, opposed to the more common international rule that says a government needs a majority for it. These rules may seem to have the same meaning, but in politics nothing is absolute, and as proof of this the Social Democrats once used this rule to form government although the liberal-conservative block was of greater number.

==Parliament==
Between [[1849]] and [[1953]], the [[Folketing]] was a house of a [[bicameral]] ''[[Rigsdag]]'', the other house being the ''[[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]]'', which was indirectly elected. However, the [[Constitution of Denmark|1953 Constitution]] established a [[unicameral]] ''Folketing'' of not more than 179 members, of whom two are elected from the [[Faroe Islands]] and two from [[Greenland]]. Elections are held at least every four years, but the prime minister can dissolve the ''Folketing'' at any time and call for new elections. ''Folketing'' members are elected by a complicated system of proportional representation; any party receiving at least 2% of the total national vote receives representation. The result is a multiplicity of parties (seven currently in parliament), the largest of which received 29% of the votes ([[as of 2005]]). Electorate participation lies normally above 85%.

== Political conditions ==
Political life in Denmark is orderly and democratic. Political changes occur gradually through a process of consensus, and political methods and attitudes are generally moderate.

The [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], historically identified with a well-organized labor movement but today appealing more broadly to the middle class, has held power either alone in [[minority cabinet|minority cabinets]] or as dominant party in [[coalition cabinet|coalition cabinets]] for most of the postwar period. [[1982]] to [[1993]], and since the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]] Denmark has been governed by [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[conservative]] coalitions &amp;ndash; currently led by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] as Prime Minister.

The vulnerability implicit in a minority coalition has been evidenced in recent coalition failure to achieve consensus on issues such as extensive reforms on matters of labor market, taxation, and the [[Social welfare|welfare system]]. Consensus decision-making is the most prominent feature of Danish politics. It often allows the small centrist parties to play a larger role than their size suggests. Although the centrist Radikale party sometimes shows traces of its pacifist past, particularly on defense spending, most major legislation is passed by sizeable majorities.

== Political parties and elections ==
{{elect|List of political parties in Denmark|Elections in Denmark}}
Denmark elects a [[legislature]] on a national level. The '''[[Folketing|Danish Parliament]]''' (''Folketinget'') has 179 members elected for four year terms. 135 of them are elected by [[proportional representation]] in 17 [[constituency|constituencies]] and 40 others are allotted in proportion to the total vote of the parties. The [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]] directly elect 2 members each.

{{Calculus}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''derivative''' is defined to be the ''instantaneous rate of change'' of a function. The derivative is one of the two central concepts of [[calculus]]. (The other is the [[integral]]; the two are related via the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].)

The simplest type of derivative is the derivative of a real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a single [[real number|real]] variable. It has several interpretations: 
* The derivative gives the [[slope]] of the [[tangent]] to the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the function at a point. In this way, derivatives can be used to determine many geometrical properties of the graph, such as [[concavity]] or [[convex|convexity]].
* The derivative provides a mathematical formulation of '''rate of change'''; it measures the rate at which the function's value [[change]]s as the function's [[parameter|argument]] changes.

This derivative is the kind usually encountered in a first course on calculus, and historically was the first to be discovered. However, there are also many [[derivative (generalizations)|generalizations of the derivative]]. 

The remainder of this article discusses only the simplest case (real-valued functions of real numbers).

==Differentiation and differentiability==
In physical terms,  '''differentiation''' expresses the rate at which a quantity, ''y'', changes with respect to the change in another quantity, ''x'', on which it has a [[function (mathematics)|functional relationship]]. Using the symbol &amp;Delta; to refer to change in a quantity, this rate is defined as a [[limit of a function|limit]] of difference quotients

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &lt;/math&gt;

as &amp;Delta;''x'' approaches 0. In [[Leibniz_notation|Leibniz's notation for derivatives]], the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' is written 
 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

suggesting the ratio of two [[infinitesimal]] quantities.  The above expression is pronounced in various ways such as &quot;''dy by dx''&quot; or &quot;''dy over dx''&quot;. The form &quot;''dy dx''&quot; is also used conversationally, although it may be confused with the notation for element of area.

Modern mathematicians do not bother with &quot;dependent quantities&quot;, but simply state that differentiation is a mathematical [[operator|operation]] on functions.  One precise way to define the derivative is as a limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

A function is '''differentiable''' at a point ''x'' if the above limit exists (as a finite real number) at that point; a function is differentiable on an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] if it is differentiable at every point within the interval.

As an alternative, the development of [[nonstandard analysis]] in the 20th century showed that Leibniz's original idea of the derivative as a ratio of infinitesimals can be made as rigorous as the formulation in terms of limits.

If a function is not [[Continuous function|continuous]] at ''x'', then there is no tangent line and the function is therefore not differentiable at ''x''; however, even if a function is continuous at ''x'', it may not be differentiable there, as in the case of the function ''y''=|''x''|, which has a kink at ''x''=0. In other words, differentiability implies continuity, but not vice versa. One famous example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere is the [[Weierstrass function]].

The derivative of a differentiable function can itself be differentiable. The derivative of a derivative is called a '''second derivative'''. Similarly, the derivative of a second derivative is a '''third derivative''', and so on.

==Newton's difference quotient==
The derivative of a function ''f'' at ''x'' is geometrically the slope of the tangent line to the graph of ''f'' at ''x''. Without the concept which we are about to define, it is impossible to directly find the slope of the [[tangent]] line to a given function, because we only know one point on the tangent line, namely (''x'', ''f''(''x'')). Instead, we will approximate the tangent line with multiple [[secant line]]s that have progressively shorter [[distance]]s between the two intersecting points. When we take the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the slopes of the nearby secant lines in this progression, we will get the slope of the tangent line. The derivative is then defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the slope of [[Secant line|secant lines]] as they approach the [[tangent]] line.
[[Image:Tangent-calculus.png|thumb|300px|Tangent line at (''x'', ''f''(''x''))]] 
[[Image:Secant-calculus.png|thumb|300px|Secant to curve ''y''= ''f''(''x'') determined by points (''x'', ''f''(''x'')) and (''x''+''h'', ''f''(''x''+''h'')).]]

To find the slopes of the nearby secant lines, choose a small number ''h''.  ''h'' represents a small change in ''x'', and it can be either [[negative and non-negative numbers|positive]] or negative.  The slope of the line through the points (''x'',''f(x)'') and (''x+h'',''f(x+h)'') is
:&lt;math&gt;{f(x+h)-f(x)\over h}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s '''[[difference quotient]]'''.  The '''derivative of''' '''''f''''' '''at''' '''''x''''' is the limit of the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines get closer and closer to being a tangent line:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}{f(x+h)-f(x)\over h}.&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Lim-secant.png|thumb|300px|Tangent line as limit of secants.]]

If the derivative of ''f'' exists at every point ''x'' in the domain, we can define the '''derivative of''' '''''f''''' to be the function whose value at a point ''x'' is the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.

Since immediately [[substitution|substituting]] 0 for ''h'' results in [[division by zero]], calculating the derivative directly can be unintuitive.  One technique is to simplify the [[numerator]] so that the ''h'' in the [[denominator]] can be cancelled.  This happens easily for [[polynomial]]s; see [[calculus with polynomials]].  For almost all functions however, the result is a mess. Fortunately, many [[Derivative (examples)|guidelines]] exist.

==Notations for differentiation==
===Lagrange's notation===
The simplest notation for differentiation that is in current use is due to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] and uses the [[Prime (mark)|prime mark]]:

{|
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;f'(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the first derivative,
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;f''(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the second derivative,
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;f'''(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the third derivative, and
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the ''n''th derivative, provided ''n'' &gt; 3
|}

===Leibniz's notation===
The other common notation is [[Leibniz's notation for differentiation]] which is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].  For the function whose value at ''x'' is the derivative of ''f'' at ''x'', we write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left(f(x)\right)}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

With Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of ''f'' at the point ''a'' in two different ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left(f(x)\right)}{dx}\left.{\!\!\frac{}{}}\right|_{x=a} = \left(\frac{d\left(f(x)\right)}{dx}\right)(a).&lt;/math&gt;

If the output of ''f''(''x'') is another variable, for example, if ''y''=''f''(''x''), we can write the derivative as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Higher derivatives are expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n\left(f(x)\right)}{dx^n}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}&lt;/math&gt;

for the ''n''-th derivative of ''f''(''x'') or ''y'' respectively. Historically, this came from the fact that, for example, the 3rd derivative is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \left(\frac{d \left( \frac{d \left(f(x)\right)} {dx}\right)} {dx}\right)} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;

which we can loosely write as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^3 \left(f(x)\right) =
\frac{d^3}{\left(dx\right)^3} \left(f(x)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Dropping brackets gives the notation above.

Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially relevant for [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easy to remember:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

(In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the &quot;du&quot; terms ''cannot'' literally [[Cancellation property|cancel]], because on their own they are undefined; they are only defined when used together to express a derivative. In [[nonstandard analysis]], however, they can be viewed as [[infinitesimal]] numbers that cancel.)

===Newton's notation===
[[Newton's notation for differentiation]] (also called the dot notation for differentiation) requires placing a dot over the function name:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = \frac{dx}{dt} = x'(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x} = x''(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and so on. 

Newton's notation is mainly used in [[mechanics]], normally for time derivatives such as velocity and acceleration, and in [[ODE]] theory. It is usually only used for first and second derivatives.

===Euler's notation===
[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s notation uses a [[differential operator]], denoted as ''D'', which is prefixed to the function with the variable as a subscript of the operator:

{|
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;D_x f(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the first derivative,
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;{D_x}^2 f(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the second derivative, and
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;{D_x}^n f(x) \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the ''n''th derivative, provided ''n'' &gt; 1
|}

This notation can also be abbreviated when taking derivatives of expressions that contain a single variable.  The subscript to the operator is dropped and is assumed to be the only variable present in the expression.  In the following examples, ''u'' represents any expression of a single variable:

{|
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;D u \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the first derivative,
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;D^2 u \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the second derivative, and
|-
|style=&quot;text-align: right; height: 2.75em&quot;|&lt;math&gt;D^n u \;&lt;/math&gt;
|for the ''n''th derivative, provided ''n'' &gt; 1
|}

Euler's notation is useful for stating and solving [[linear differential equation]]s.

==Critical points==
Points on the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a function where the derivative is undefined or equals [[0 (number)|zero]] are called ''critical points'' or sometimes ''[[stationary point]]s'' (in the case where the derivative equals zero).  If the second derivative is positive at a critical point, that point is a [[local minimum]]; if negative, it is a [[local maximum]]; if zero, it may or may not be a local minimum or local maximum.  Taking derivatives and solving for critical points is often a simple way to find local minima or maxima, which can be useful in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].  In fact, local minima and maxima can only occur at critical points or endpoints.  This is related to the [[extreme value theorem]].

==Physics==
Arguably the most important application of calculus to [[physics]] is the concept of the &quot;'''time derivative'''&quot;—the rate of change over time—which is required for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in [[Newtonian physics]]:
* [[Velocity]] (instantaneous velocity; the concept of average velocity predates calculus) is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's [[Displacement (distance)|position]].
* [[Acceleration]] is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position.

For example, if an object's position on a line is given by &lt;math&gt;x(t) = -16t^2 + 16t + 32&lt;/math&gt;; then, the object's velocity is &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t) = x'(t) = -32t + 16&lt;/math&gt;, and the object's acceleration is &lt;math&gt;\ddot x(t) = x''(t) = -32&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[velocity]] of a [[automobile|car]] is given, as a function of [[time]], then, the derivative of said function with respect to time describes the [[acceleration]] of said car, as a function of time.

==Rules for finding the derivative ==
In many cases, complicated limit calculations by direct application of Newton's difference quotient can be avoided using  differentiation rules.

* ''Constant rule'': The derivative of any [[constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]]. 
** ''Constant multiple rule'': If ''c'' is some [[real number]]; then, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;cf(x)&lt;/math&gt; equals ''c'' [[multiplication|multiplied]] by the derivative of ''f''(''x'') (a consequence of linearity below).
* ''[[Linearity of differentiation|Linearity]]'': &lt;math&gt;(af + bg)' = af' + bg'&lt;/math&gt; for all functions ''f'' and ''g'' and all real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.
* ''[[Calculus with polynomials|Power rule]]'': If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^r&lt;/math&gt;, for some [[real number]] ''r''; &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = rx^{r-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''[[Product rule]]'':  &lt;math&gt; (fg)' = f'g + fg'&lt;/math&gt; for all functions ''f'' and ''g''. 
* ''[[Quotient rule]]'': &lt;math&gt;(f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/(g^2)&lt;/math&gt; unless ''g'' is zero.
* ''[[Chain rule]]'': If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = h(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = h'(g(x)) g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''[[Inverse function]]'': If the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;  has an inverse &lt;math&gt;g(x) = f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g'(x) = 1/f'(f^{-1}(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''Derivative of one variable with respect to another when both are functions of a third variable'': Let &lt;math&gt;x = f(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = g(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  Now &lt;math&gt;d y/d x = (d y/d t)/(d x/d t)&lt;/math&gt;. This is the chain rule in the Leibniz notation.

In addition, the derivatives of some common functions are useful to know. See the [[table of derivatives]].

As an example, the derivative of 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x^4 + \sin (x^2) - \ln (x)\;e^x + 7&lt;/math&gt; 
is 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = 8x^3 + 2x\cos (x^2) - \frac{1}{x}\;e^x - \ln (x)\;e^x.&lt;/math&gt;

== Using derivatives to graph functions ==
Derivatives are a useful tool for examining the [[graph of a function|graphs of functions]]. In particular, the points in the interior of the domain of a real-valued function which take that function to local [[extremum|extrema]] will all have a first derivative of zero. However, not all critical points are local extrema; for example, ''f(x)=x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a critical point at ''x=0'', but it has neither a maximum nor a minimum there.  The [[first derivative test]] and the [[second derivative test]] provide ways to determine if the critical points are maxima, minima or neither.

In the case of multidimensional domains, the function will have a partial derivative of zero with respect to each dimension at local extrema.  In this case, the Second Derivative Test can still be used to characterize critical points, by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second partial derivatives of the function at the critical point.  If all of the eigenvalues are positive, then the point is a local minimum; if all are negative, it is a local maximum.  If there are some positive and some negative eigenvalues, then the critical point is a [[saddle point]], and if none of these cases hold then the test is inconclusive (e.g., eigenvalues of 0 and 3).

Once the local extrema have been found, it is usually rather easy to get a rough idea of the general graph of the function, since (in the single-dimensional domain case) it will be uniformly increasing or decreasing except at critical points, and hence (assuming it is [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]]) will have values in between its values at the critical points on either side.

== Generalizations ==
{{see details|derivative (generalizations)}}
Where a function depends on more than one variable, the concept of a '''[[partial derivative]]''' is used. Partial derivatives can be thought of informally as taking the derivative of the function with all but one variable held temporarily constant near a point. Partial derivatives are represented as &amp;part;/&amp;part;x (where &amp;part; is a rounded 'd' known as the 'partial derivative symbol'). Some people pronounce the partial derivative symbol as 'der' rather than the 'dee' used for the standard derivative symbol, 'd'.  

The concept of derivative can be extended to more general settings. The common thread is that the derivative at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point. Perhaps the most natural situation is that of functions between differentiable [[manifold]]s; the derivative at a certain point then becomes a [[linear transformation]] between the corresponding [[tangent space]]s and the derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s.

In order to differentiate all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and much more, one defines the concept of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]. 

For [[complex number|complex]] functions of a complex variable differentiability is a much stronger condition than that the real and [[imaginary part]] of the function are differentiable with respect to the real and imaginary part of the argument. For example, the function ''f''(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'')&amp;nbsp;= ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''iy'' satisfies the latter, but not the first. See also the article on [[holomorphic function]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Dravidian''' [[Language families and languages|family of languages]] includes approximately 26 languages that are mainly spoken in [[South India|southern India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as certain areas in [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], and eastern and central [[India]], as well as in parts of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]].
Dravidian languages are spoken by more than 200 million people, and they appear to be unrelated to languages of other known families. A few scholars include the Dravidian languages in a larger [[Elamo-Dravidian language family]], which includes the ancient [[Elamite language]] of what is now southwestern Iran; but this is not accepted by most of the Dravidianists.

==History==

The origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation, are unclear, and the situation is not helped by the lack of [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research into the Dravidian languages.  There are striking similarities between the Dravidian and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language groups, which suggest prolonged contact between the language families at some stage although a common origin appears unlikely.  Inconclusive attempts have also been made to link the family with the [[Japonic languages]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], the [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] and the relatively unknown language of the [[Indus valley civilisation]].

Legends common to many Dravidian-speaking groups speak of their origin in a vast, now-sunken continent far to the south.  Many linguists, however, tend to favour the theory that speakers of Dravidian languages spread southwards and eastwards through the [[Indian subcontinent]], based on the fact that the southern Dravidian languages show some signs of contact with linguistic groups which the northern Dravidian languages do not.  [[Proto-Dravidian]] is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 1500 BC, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub-families points to an earlier split.

The existence of the Dravidian language family was first suggested in [[1816]] by [[Alexander D. Campbell]] in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'', in which he and [[Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] were descended from a common, non-Indo-European ancestor. However, it was not until [[1856]] that [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages'', which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established it as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term &quot;Dravidian&quot; from the [[Sanskrit]] ''dr&amp;#257;vida'', which was used in a 7th century text to refer to the languages of the south of India. The publication of the ''[[Dravidian etymological dictionary]]'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B. Emeneau]] was a landmark event in Dravidian linguistics.

==Grammar==

Dravidian languages are [[agglutinative]] and exhibit the [[inclusive and exclusive we]] feature.

==Phonology==
Dravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages (especially Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu) have large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-European languages]], which do make distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are often mispronounced by monolingual Dravidian speakers.

For instance, Tamil, like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops.

Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].

===Reversal property===
Words in Dravidian languages have the property that, by reversing the consonants and applying a well defined set of transformations of the vowels, another word with a similar meaning is obtained. Over time, one form may represent the general case and the other end up representing a special case.

For example: 
*Erasu (gather) and sEru (join) 
*kaNu (look) and iNuku (peep)
*atta (attic) reverses to itself.

===Words starting with vowels===
A substantial number of words also begin and end with vowels, which helps the languages' agglutinative property.

aLu (cry), elumbu (bone), adu (that), alli (there), idu (this), illai (no, absent)

adu-idil-illai (that-this-in-absent = that is absent in this)

===Numbers===

=== Sanskrit influence ===
[[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] have been relatively more influenced by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language [[Sanskrit]] and have borrowed the aspirated consonants. Sanskrit words and derivatives are common in Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu. [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is the least influenced and retains the closest form of the Proto-Dravidian language.

[[Image:Dracula Stamp.jpg|thumb|[[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula; U.S. postage stamp first issued in 1997 as part of a series celebrating &quot;Famous Movie Monsters&quot;]]
'''''Dracula''''' (1897) is a novel by [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Bram Stoker]], and the name of the world's most famous [[vampire]] character.

''Dracula'' has been attributed to many [[literary genre]]s including [[horror fiction]], the [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]]. Structurally it is an [[epistolary novel]], that is, told as a series of [[diary]] entries and letters. [[Literary criticism|Literary critics]] have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, sexuality, immigration and folklore. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for scores of theatrical and movie interpretations throughout the 20th century.

==Novel background==
Between 1878 and 1898 Stoker managed the world-famous London [[Lyceum Theatre]], where he supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most famous being the vampire tale ''[[Dracula]]'' published in [[1897]]. Parts of it are set around the town of [[Whitby]], where he was living at the time. While ''Dracula'' is famous today (due in large part to its 20th century life on film), it was not an important or famous work for Victorian readers, being just another pot-boiler adventure among many. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s authors such as [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[H.G. Wells]] wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threaten the British Empire. [[Invasion literature]] was at a peak, and Stoker's formula of an invasion of England by continental European influences was by 1897 very familiar to readers of fantastic adventure stories.

[[Image:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shakespearian actor and friend of Stoker's, [[Henry Irving]] was a real-life inspiration for the character of Dracula, tailor-made to his dramatic presence, gentlemanly mannerisms and specialty playing villain roles. Irving however never agreed to play the part on stage.]]

Before writing ''Dracula'', Stoker spent seven years researching European folklore and stories of vampires, being most influenced by [[Emily Gerard]]'s 1885 essay &quot;Transylvania Superstitions&quot;. Though it is the most famous vampire novel ever, ''Dracula'' was not the first.  It was preceded and partially inspired by [[J. Sheridan Le Fanu|Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s 1871 ''[[Carmilla]]'', about a [[lesbian vampire]] who preys upon a lonely young woman. The image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man, like the character of Dracula, was created by [[John Polidori]] in [[The Vampyre]] (1819), during the summer spent with [[Frankenstein]] creator [[Mary Shelley]] and other friends in [[1816]]. Polidori is many times credited as the creator of the vampire genre in fiction, but his vampire story was inspired by elements of [[Lord Byron]]'s vampire poem, [[The Giaour]] (1813).

The Lyceum Theatre where Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898 was headed by the tyrannical actor-manager [[Henry Irving]], who was Stoker's real-life inspiration for the mannerisms of Dracula, and who Stoker hoped would play Dracula in a stage version. Although Irving never did agree to do a stage version, Dracula's dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from Irving.

''The Dead Un-Dead'' was one of Stoker's original titles for ''Dracula'', and up until a few weeks before publication, the manuscript was titled simply ''The Un-Dead''. The name of Stoker's count was originally going to be Count Vampyre, but while doing research Stoker ran across an intriguing word in the Romanian language: &quot;Dracul&quot;, meaning &quot;Devil&quot;.  There was also a historic figure known as Prince Vlad Dracula ([[Vlad the Impaler]]), but whether or not Stoker based his character on him remains debatable (see &quot;Historical connections&quot; below).

''Dracula'' is an [[epistolary novel]], written as collection of diary entries, telegrams, and letters from the characters, as well as fictional clippings from the Whitby and London newspapers.  This literary style, made most famous by one of the most popular novels of the 19th century, ''[[The Woman in White]]'' (1860), was considered rather old-fashioned by the time of the publication of ''Dracula'', but it adds a sense of realism and provides the reader with the perspective of most of the major characters.

''Dracula'' has been the basis for countless [[film]]s and plays. Three of the most famous are ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), ''Dracula'' (1931), and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). ''Nosferatu'' was produced while Stoker's widow was still alive, and the filmmakers were forced to change the setting and the names of the characters for copyright reasons.  The vampire in ''Nosferatu'' is called Count Orlok rather than Count Dracula. ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'', while closer to the novel's plot than most movies produced earlier (or since), reimagines the Count as a tragic figure instead of a monster. It adds an opening sequence that focuses on the Count's Romanian background, and inserts a new romantic subplot into the story.

Stoker wrote several other novels dealing with horror and supernatural themes, but none achieved the lasting fame or success of ''Dracula''.  His other novels include ''[[The Snake's Pass]]'' ([[1890]]), ''[[The Jewel of Seven Stars]]'' ([[1903]]), and ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]'' (1911).

==Historical connections==
Although ''Dracula'' is a work of fiction, it does contain some historical references. The historical connections with the novel and how much Stoker really knew about the history is a matter of conjecture and debate.

Following the publication of ''In Search of Dracula'' by [[Radu Florescu]] and [[Raymond McNally]] in [[1972]], the supposed connections between the historical [[Vlad III Dracula]] and Bram Stoker's fictional Dracula attracted popular attention. During the six-year reign of Vlad III ([[1456]]&amp;ndash;[[1462]]), &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; is said to have killed from 20,000 to 40,000 European civilians (political rivals, criminals, and anyone else he considered &quot;useless to humanity&quot;), mainly by using his favourite method of impaling them on a sharp pole. (It should be noted, however, that the main source of Romanian history from this time is records by [[Germany|German]] settlers in neighboring [[Hungary]], who had frequent clashes with Vlad for political and economical reasons, and may be somewhat biased.) Vlad is revered as a folk hero by [[Romania|Romanians]] for driving off invading Turks with his brutal tactics; his impaled victims are said to have included as many as 100,000 [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Islam|Muslims]].

Historically, the name &quot;Dracula&quot; is derived from a secret fraternal order of knights called the [[Order of the Dragon]], founded by [[Sigismund of Luxembourg|King Sigismund of Hungary]] (who became the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[1410]]) to uphold [[Christianity]] and defend the Empire against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. [[Vlad II Dracul]], father of Vlad III, was admitted to the Order around [[1431]] because of his bravery in fighting the Turks. From 1431 onward Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later, as ruler of Wallachia, his [[coinage]] bore the dragon symbol. The word &quot;Dracula&quot; translates as both &quot;dragon&quot; and &quot;devil&quot; in the Romanian language. In Romanian the ending ''ulea'' meant &quot;the son of&quot;. Vlad III thus became Vlad ''Draculea'', &quot;The Son of the Dragon&quot;. 

Certainly Stoker did find the name Dracula in his reading on [[Romanian history]]. This became a replacement for the name ''Count Wampyr'', which he had intended to use for his villain. Recently, however, many Dracula scholars led by Elizabeth Miller have questioned the connection's depth. It now seems likely that Stoker knew little of Vlad himself, other than the name Dracula by which he called himself. Certainly the sections of the novel in which Dracula recounts his history are garbled rephrasings of the one work Stoker's notes show he did consult on Romanian history (which gives few details on Vlad's reign, and does not mention his use of impalement). Most importantly, given Stoker's meticulous use of historical background to make it more horrific, it seems unlikely he would have failed to mention that his villain Dracula had impaled thousands of people if he had actually known much of Vlad's background. Nor is Dracula ever called &quot;Vlad&quot; in the novel. Furthermore in the novel Dracula claims to be a [[Székely|Szekler]] (''Székely'' in Hungarian) - &quot;We Szekelys have a right to be proud...&quot; - whereas Vlad is clearly an ethnic [[Vlachs|Vlach]].  Finally, no one compared Vlad to a vampire in his lifetime (Being a descendant of the [[Dacian]] &quot;Wolf People&quot; who was sometimes called a &quot;Great [[Berserker]]&quot; by the Germans, it is possible that some associated him with [[lycanthropy]]).

In writing ''Dracula'', Stoker may also have drawn upon stories about the [[sídhe]] &amp;mdash; some of which feature blood-drinking women &amp;mdash; and the Dracula legend as he created it and as it has been portrayed in films and television shows ever since may be a compound of various influences; many of Stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to an earlier Irish writer, [[Sheridan le Fanu]]'s, classic of the vampire genre, ''[[Carmilla]]''.

Some have claimed the castle of Count Dracula was inspired by [[Slains Castle]], at which Bram Stoker was a guest of the 19th [[Earl of Erroll]]. However, as Stoker visited the castle in [[1895]], five years after work on Dracula had started there is unlikely to be much connection. Many of the scenes in [[Whitby]] and [[London]] are based on real places which Stoker frequently visited himself, although in some cases he misrepresents the geography for the sake of the plot.

It has been suggested that Stoker received much historical information from [[Arminus Vambery]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] professor he met at least twice. Miller argues that &quot;there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included Vlad, [[vampire]]s, or even [[Transylvania]]&quot; and that &quot;Furthermore, there is no record of any other correspondence between Stoker and Vambery, nor is Vambery mentioned in Stoker's notes for Dracula.&quot; [http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~emiller/kalo.htm]

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}

The story begins when Jonathan Harker, an English [[solicitor]], is invited to the [[Count]]'s crumbling, remote [[castle]] (situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], on the border of [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldavia]]), to provide legal support for a [[real estate]] transaction on behalf of Harker's employer in London; at first seduced by the Counts gracious manner, he soon discovers he has become a ''de facto'' prisoner and begins to see disquieting facets of the Count's daily life. Searching for a way out of the castle one night, he falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires, but is saved at the last minute by the Count who wants to retain Harker as a friend to teach him about London, where the Count plans to travel among the &quot;teeming millions&quot;. Harker eventually barely escapes with his life from the castle.

[[Image:Dracula1st.jpeg|thumb|'''Dracula''' by [[Bram Stoker]], 1st edition cover, [[Archibald Constable and Company]], ''1897'']]

Not long afterward, a [[Russia]]n ship runs aground during a fierce [[tempest]], on the shores of [[Whitby]], a coastal town in [[England]].  All passengers and crew are dead. A huge [[dog]] or [[wolf]] is seen running from the ship, which contains nothing but boxes of dirt from Transylvania: Count Dracula, in his animal form, has arrived in England.

Soon the Count is menacing Harker's devoted fiancée, [[Mina Harker|Wilhelmina &quot;Mina&quot; Murray]], and her vivacious friend, [[Lucy Westenra]]. Lucy receives three [[marriage]] proposals in one day, from Arthur Holmwood (Lord Godalming); an [[United States|American]] cowboy named Quincey Morris who always carries a [[bowie knife]]; and an [[lunatic asylum|asylum]] [[psychiatrist]], Dr. John Seward. There is a notable encounter between Dracula and Seward's patient [[Renfield]], an insane man who means to consume [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[bird]]s, and other creatures &amp;mdash; in ascending order of size &amp;mdash; in order to absorb their &quot;life force&quot;. Renfield acts as a kind of motion sensor, detecting the proximity of Dracula and releasing clues accordingly.

Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously. All of her suitors fret; Seward calls in his old teacher, Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy's condition, but refuses to disclose it, knowing that Seward's faith in him will be shaken if he starts spouting off about vampires. Van Helsing tries multiple [[blood transfusion]]s, but they are clearly losing ground. On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is accidentally sent to the wrong address), Lucy and her mother are attacked in the night by a [[wolf]]. Mrs Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright, and Lucy herself apparently dies soon after.
&lt;!-- The wolf is a real wolf, which Dracula breaks out of London Zoo for backup; the narrative includes a press clipping about the wolf's mysterious escape and subsequent return. Is this worth mentioning in the plot summary? - See Talk: page --&gt;

Lucy is buried, but soon afterward the newspapers report a &quot;bloofer lady&quot; (sometimes explained as &quot;beautiful lady&quot;) stalking children in the night. Van Helsing, knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Arthur, and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down, and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur, they stake her heart and [[decapitation|behead]] her. 

Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives home from Transylvania (Mina joined him there after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition, who now turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula himself.

After Dracula learns of Van Helsing and the others' plot against him, he takes revenge by visiting -- and biting -- Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood, creating a mind bond between them, and aiming to control her. The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first and the rest of the novel deals with the main characters trying to achieve this. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins, switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi-trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. Mina uses this connection to track Dracula's movements. 

Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania, followed by Van Helsing's gang, who manage to track him down just before sundown and kill him by &quot;shearing through the kneck&quot; and stabbing him in the heart with a bowie knife. Dracula crumbles to dust, his spell is lifted and Mina freed from the marks. Quincey Morris is killed in the final battle, and the survivors return to England.

The book closes with a note about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son, whom they name Quincey in remembrance of their American friend.

==Analysis==
The novel is narrated by multiple voices &amp;mdash; Jonathan's journal of his trip to Transylvania, Mina's diary, and Seward's recorded journal, as well as letters and newspaper items. Although somewhat crude and certainly sensational, the novel also does have psychological power, and the sexual longings underlying the vampire attacks are manifest. 

Despite its important contributions to vampire fiction, several popular traits of fictional vampires are absent. Count Dracula is killed by knives, not a wooden stake. The destruction of the vampire Lucy is a three-part process (staking, [[decapitation]], and [[garlic]] in the mouth), not the simple stake-only procedure often found in later vampire stories. Dracula has the ability to travel as a mist and to scale the external walls of his castle. One very famous trait Stoker added is the inability to be seen in mirrors, which is not something found in traditional Eastern European [[folklore]]. 

It is also notable in the novel that Dracula can walk about in the daylight, in bright sunshine, though apparently without the ability to use most of his powers, like turning into mist or a bat. He is still strong and fast enough to struggle with and escape from most of his male pursuers, in a scene in the book. Traditional vampire folklore does not usually hold that sunlight is fatal to vampires though they are [[nocturnal]]. It is only with the film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' that the daylight is first depicted as deadly to vampires.

Modern analysts have detected in ''Dracula'' a strong sexual component. As one critic wrote:

::''What has become clearer and clearer, particularly in the ''fin de siècle'' years of the twentieth century, is that the novel's power has its source in the sexual implications of the blood exchange between the vampire and his victims...''Dracula'' has embedded in it a very disturbing psychosexual allegory whose meaning I am not sure Stoker entirely understood: that there is a demonic force at work in the world whose intent is to eroticize women. In ''Dracula'' we see how that force transforms Lucy Westenra, a beautiful nineteen-year-old virgin, into a shameless slut.'' (Leonard Wolf, &quot;Introduction&quot; to the Signet Classic Edition, 1992).

''Dracula'' may also be viewed as a novel about the struggle between tradition and modernity at the [[fin de siècle]]. Throughout, there are various references to changing [[gender]] roles; Mina Harker is a thoroughly modern woman, as she uses (then) modern technologies such as the [[typewriter]], but she still embodies a traditional gender role as an assistant school mistress. 

Stoker's novel also deals in general with the conflict between the world of the past &amp;mdash; full of folklore, myth, legend, and religious piety &amp;mdash; and the emerging modern world of technology, logical positivism, and secularism. 

Van Helsing epitomizes this struggle because he uses, at the time, extremely modern technologies like blood transfusions; but he is not so modern as to eschew the idea that a demonic being could be causing Lucy's illness, thus he spreads garlic around the sashes and doors of her room and makes her wear a garlic necklace. After Lucy's death, he receives an indulgence from a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] cleric to use the [[Eucharist]] (held by the Church to be transubstantiated into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]) in his fight against Dracula. In trying to bridge the rational/superstitious conflict within the story, he cites then-new sciences, such as [[hypnotism]], that were only recently considered magical. He also quotes (without attribution) the [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] [[William James]], whose writings on the power of belief become the only way to deal with this conflict. 

Jonathan Harker's character displays the problems of dwelling in a strictly rational modern world. Visiting Count Dracula in Eastern Europe, Jonathan scoffs at the peasants who tell him to delay his visit until after [[Saint George]]'s feast day. As a rational solicitor, Jonathan is concerned “with facts &amp;mdash; bare meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt” (''Dracula''). All of Jonathan’s rationality weakens him to what he witnesses at Castle Dracula. For example, the first time Jonathan witnesses the Count crawling down the castle face down, he is in complete disbelief. Not believing what he sees, he attempts to explain what he saw as a trick of the moon light.

Despite the aforementioned problems of rationality in dealing with vampires, the characters of ''Dracula'' use (then) modern [[technology]] and rationalism to defeat the count. For example, during their pursuit of the vampire, they use [[railroads]] and [[steamships]], not to mention the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], to keep a step ahead of him (in contrast, the count escapes in a sailboat). Van Helsing uses the aforementioned method of hypnotism to pinpoint Dracula's location. Mina even employs the then-primitive field of [[criminology]] to anticipate the count's actions, and cites both [[Cesare Lombroso]] and [[Max Nordau]], who at the time of the novel were considered experts in this field.

==Dracula in Romania==
After the death of [[Nicolae Ceau&amp;#351;escu]], a tourist industry sprung up in [[Transylvania]] (and, to a lesser extent, in [[Wallachia]]). However, Romanians have mixed feelings about linking one of their national heroes and the vampire monster.

Historical places connected to Vlad &amp;#354;epe&amp;#351; are publicised under a Dracula theme catering largely, but not entirely, to foreign markets. [[Bran Castle]], which has only a very tangential connection with the historical Vlad &amp;#354;epe&amp;#351;, now exaggerates that connection and promotes itself as &quot;Dracula's Castle&quot;. [http://www.draculascastle.com/] A dungeon-themed disco, catering to a mostly Romanian crowd and located in the basement of a former inn immediately adjacent to the [[Curtea Veche]] (&quot;Old Court&quot;) -- onetime site of Vlad &amp;#354;epe&amp;#351;' castle in [[Bucharest]] -- calls itself by the English-language name &quot;Impaler&quot;. The well-preserved medieval town of [[Sighi&amp;#351;oara]], Vlad &amp;#354;epe&amp;#351;'s birthplace, seriously considered building a Dracula [[theme park]] on the edge of town, but in the end it was decided that such a site would cheapen the beauty and history of the medieval city and the plan was blocked.  The park was then to have been built close to Bucharest (which is nowhere near Transylvania) but plans have subsequently been scrapped.

==Dracula in the arts==

[[Image:DraculaLugosi1931Poster.jpg|thumb|[[1931]] film poster, promoting [[Bela Lugosi]]'s genre-defining turn as Dracula.]]

The character of Count Dracula has remained popular over the years, and many [[film]]s have used the character as a villain, while others have referenced him in movie titles such as ''[[Daughters of Dracula]],'' ''[[Lady Dracula]]'', and ''[[Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (film)|Zoltan, Hound of Dracula]]''.  An estimated 160 films ([[as of 2004]]) feature Dracula in a major role, a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]].  The total number of films that include a reference to Dracula may reach as high as 649 movies, according to the [[Internet Movie Database]].

Most tellings of the Dracula story include not only the Count, but the rest of the &quot;cast&quot;:  Jonathan and Mina Harker, Van Helsing, and Renfield. (Notably, the novel roles of characters Jonathan Harker and Renfield are more than occasionally reversed or combined, as are the roles of Mina and Lucy. Quincey Morris is usually omitted entirely.)

One of the first film adaptations of Stoker's story actually caused Stoker's estate to sue for [[copyright infringement]].  In [[1922]], [[silent film]] director [[F.W. Murnau]] made a [[horror film]] called ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu: eine Symphonie des Grauens]]'' ('Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror'), which took the story of Dracula and set it in [[Germany]]&lt;!--it's a German film, but was it set in Germany?--&gt;.  In the story, Dracula's role was changed to that of [[Count Orlok]], one of the most hideous versions of the vampire ever to be created for a movie, played by [[Max Schreck]] (whose name literally means 'fright'). 

The Stoker estate won its lawsuit and all existing prints of ''Nosferatu'' were ordered to be destroyed.  However, a number of [[copyright infringement|pirated]] copies of the movie survived to the present era, where they entered the public domain.  ''Nosferatu'' was also remade [[1979 in film|in 1979]] by [[Werner Herzog]].

In [[1927]] the story was adapted for the Broadway stage by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] and starred [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as the Count and Van Helsing respectively. Lugosi initially learned his lines phonetically.

The [[1931 in film|1931]] film version of ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' starred [[Bela Lugosi]] and was directed by [[Tod Browning]]. It is one of the more famous versions of the story and is commonly considered a horror classic.  In [[2000]] the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It is an adaptation of the [[1927]] play and Van Sloan also transferred his role to the big screen.  The films only had music during the opening and closing credits. In [[1999]] [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score to accompany the film. The current DVD release allows access to this music.

[[Image:dracula1931-spanish.jpg|thumb|200px|Carlos Villarías as Dracula in the George Medford-directed Spanish language version of the 1931 Tod Browning/Bela Lugosi classic.]]
At the same time as the Lugosi film a [[Spanish language]] version was filmed for release in Mexico. It was filmed at night using the same sets as the Tod Browning production with a different cast and crew (a common practice in the early days of sound films). [[George Melford|George Melford's]] was the director and it starred [[Carlos Villarías]] as the Count, [[Eduardo Arozamena]] as Van Helsing and [[Lupita Tovar]] as Eva.

Due to America's censorship laws, Medford's ''Dracula'' contains scenes that could not be put in the final cut of the more familiar English version.  There is considerable debate among fans over which film is better. Fans of Medford's version say the acting of the Spanish version is crisper and the pace is much quicker -- and there's no hammy close-ups of Lugosi.  It is also included on the available DVD.

During the era of the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]], the [[Universal Studios]] horror films made Dracula a household name by starring him as a villain in a number of movies, including several where he met other monsters (the most famous of which is the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' in which Lugosi played Dracula on film for only the second and final time.)  In these films he somehow gained control over the [[Frankenstein]] monster, and in a number of movies the monster acted as Dracula's servant, usually referring to the vampire Count as &quot;Master.&quot;

=== Universal Studios productions of Dracula ===
The Universal Studios films in which Dracula (or a relative) appeared (and the actor portraying the character) were:

# ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' ([[1931]] - [[Bela Lugosi]]. A second version was filmed simultaneously in Spanish, with [[Carlos Villarías|Carlos Villar]] as Dracula)
# ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' ([[1936]] - [[Gloria Holden]])
# ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' ([[1943]] - [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]])
# ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' ([[1944]] - [[John Carradine]])
# ''[[House of Dracula]]'' ([[1945]] - Carradine)
# ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein|Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' ([[1948]] - Lugosi. This film is usually known as ''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'', however the title given here is the official on-screen title according to the Internet Movie Database.)

In [[1938]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[John Houseman]] chose ''Dracula'' to be the inaugural episode of the new radio show featuring their Broadway production company, ''[[Mercury Theatre|The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. The adaption was faithful to the book, although condensed to fit in the show's hour-long format. Welles was the voice of Dracula.

=== Hammer Films productions of Dracula ===
[[1958 in film|In 1958]], [[Hammer Films]] produced [[Dracula (1958 film)| Dracula (1958)]], a newer, more Gothic version of the story, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as Dracula and [[Peter Cushing]] as Van Helsing. It is widely considered to be one of the best versions of the story to be adapted to film, and in [[2004]] was named by the [[magazine]] ''[[Total Film]]'' as the 30th greatest British film of all time. Although it takes many liberties with the novel's plot, the creepy atmosphere and charismatic performance of Lee make it memorable and favored. It was released in the United States as ''Horror of Dracula'' to avoid confusion with the earlier Lugosi version. This was followed by a long series of Dracula films, usually featuring Lee as Dracula.

The Hammer films in which Dracula (or a relative) appeared (and the actor portraying the character) were:

# ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' ([[1958]]) - [[Christopher Lee]]. Released in the US as ''Horror of Dracula''
# ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]'' ([[1960]] - [[David Peel (actor)|David Peel]] as Dracula disciple Baron Meinster)
# ''[[Dracula: Prince of Darkness]]'' ([[1966]] - Lee)
# ''[[Dracula Has Risen from the Grave]]'' ([[1968]] - Lee)
# ''[[Taste the Blood of Dracula]]'' ([[1969]] - Lee)
# ''[[Scars of Dracula]]'' ([[1970]] - Lee)
# ''[[Dracula A.D. 1972]]'' ([[1972]] - Lee)
# ''[[The Satanic Rites of Dracula]]'' ([[1973]] - Lee).  Released in the US as ''Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride''
# ''[[The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires|The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires]]'' ([[1974]] - [[John Forbes-Robertson]]).  Variously released as ''The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula'' and ''Dracula and the Seven Golden Vampires''
Christopher Lee, the British actor who played in the Hammer Dracula films, reminisced in a 1999 inteview for NPR: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1065958

=== Other productions 1969 - 1979 ===
[[Count Dracula (1969 film)]], directed by [[Jesus Franco]] starring Christopher Lee as Dracula. While not a part of the Hammer series some fans feel that it is close to the spirit of the book.

[[1972 in film|In 1972]], [[Paul Naschy]] starred in [[Dracula's Great Love]], directed by [[Javier Aguirre]] for the Spanish production company Janus Films. This movie predated the vision of Dracula as a romantic character to [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s by 20 years.

[[1973 in film|In 1973]], a major television movie version starring [[Jack Palance]] was produced by [[Dan Curtis]], best known for producing the gothic [[soap opera]] ''Dark Shadows''. Filmed in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and England, it was a fairly faithful and moody piece.

[[1974 in film|In 1974]], [[Andy Warhol]] presented an outrageously campy [[Dracula]] (a.k.a. &quot;[[Blood for Dracula]]&quot;), directed by [[Paul Morrissey]] and starring cult icon [[Udo Kier]].

[[Dracula Père et Fils 1976]], [[Christopher Lee]] French movie starring Christopher Lee as Dracula

[[1977]] saw a BBC version made for television starring [[Louis Jourdan]]. This version is one of the more faithful adaptations of the book. It includes all of the main characters from the book (only blending together Arthur and Quincey) and has scenes of Jonathon recording events in his diary and Dr. Seward speaking into his dictaphone.

[[1977]] also saw a revival of the 1927 broadway version. The atmospheric sets and costumes were designed by [[Edward Gorey]]. The Count was portrayed by [[Frank Langella]]  and, like Lugosi before him, he would go on to perform the role on the big screen. The same Gorey sets and costumes were used for a U.S. touring version of the play starring [[Jeremy Brett]]. The Deane-Balderston lines were altered somewhat and played for a more comedic effect.

In [[1978]], an independent film company produced the horror thriller ''[[Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (film)|Zoltan, Hound of Dracula]]'' starring [[Michael Pataki]] as the mild-mannered family psychiatrist destined to encounter the resurrected hound of Dracula.

In [[1979]], [[Frank Langella]] starred opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] as a sexually charged version of the Count in a new film version. It is considered of uneven quality, though the [[John Williams]] score is superb.  That year also saw the release of ''[[Love at First Bite]]'', a [[romantic comedy film|romantic comedy]] spoof set in contemporary [[New York City]] starring [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as the count.

=== Dracula movies 1980 - 1999 ===
In [[1992]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] produced and directed a new version of the film, called ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' starring [[Gary Oldman]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Keanu Reeves]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Coppola's story includes a subplot in which Mina Harker was revealed to be the [[reincarnation]] of Dracula's greatest love.  This story is not part of Stoker's original.  The soundtrack includes 'Lovesong for a Vampire' by [[Annie Lennox]].

In [[1995]], [[Mel Brooks]] did a comedic parody, ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'', which parodied all of the standard Dracula themes, but especially noteworthy was the scene where Dracula's reflection was noticeably absent in a mirror as he danced at a ball, to the horror of those watching.  [[Mel Brooks]] played Van Helsing as an aged Professor. Dracula was played by [[Leslie Nielsen]].

=== Dracula movies 2000 to present ===
[[Patrick Lussier]] took a stab at the legend with his modern day ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', promoted as ''Wes Craven Presents Dracula 2000''. [[Wes Craven]] was an executive producer. It was released in the UK as ''Dracula 2001''. To discover how to destroy Dracula, Van Helsing (portrayed by [[Christopher Plummer]]) keeps himself alive with injections of Dracula's blood. When thieves steal the vampire and crash near [[New Orleans]], Van Helsing and his ward must track down the vampire and save Van Helsing's daughter Mary.

In 2002, Canadian cult film director [[Guy Maddin]] released his screen adaptation of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's version of the count's tale, a [[ballet]] set to the music of [[Gustav Mahler]] and titled ''[[Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary]]''. 

The character of Mina Harker appeared in the 2003 film adaptation of the [[graphic novel]] ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' as a vampiric heroine played by [[Peta Wilson]].

''[[Van Helsing]]'' is a film based on the vampire-hunter Van Helsing from the book, only reinvented as an immortal action hero assigned by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to kill monsters. [[Richard Roxburgh]] portrays Dracula in this reinvigoration of the 1930s and 1940s Universal Horror monsters which also featured new versions of the [[Frankenstein Monster]] and [[The Wolf Man]]. In this movie, Dracula is somewhat of a super vampire and cannot be killed by the normal methods that can kill a vampire. 

A character named Drake serves as the primary antagonist in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', in which a group of vampires summon him in order to finally defeat Blade. While he is not confirmed directly to be Dracula, Drake is implied to have lived under several different aliases and personalities, one of which may have been the infamous vampire.

[[2005]] saw the premiere of Dracula's most recent play incarnation, an adaptation by playwright [[P. Shane Mitchell]]. A French Canadian musical production (&quot;Dracula: Entre l'amour et la mort&quot;[http://www.zone3.ca/dracula/index.htm]) opened in Montreal in January 2006, starring Bruno Pelletier.

==Popular culture==
Like ''Frankenstein'', ''Dracula'' has inspired many literary tributes or parodies, including [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Salem's Lot]]'', [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Anno Dracula]]'', [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', [[Elizabeth Kostova]]'s ''[[The Historian]]'', [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s ''The Dracula Tape'', [[Wendy Swanscombe]]'s [[pornography|erotic]] parody ''[[Vamp (movie)|Vamp]]'', and [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''Children of the Night''.  [[Loren D. Estleman]]'s novel ''The Case of the Sanguinary Count'' pits Dracula against that equally venerable Victorian-era character, [[Sherlock Holmes]]. [[Freda Warrington]]'s ''Dracula the Undead'' is a sequel to ''Dracula''.

Dracula has been a recurring character in many [[comic book]]s, most notably, the [[Marvel comic]] ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' written primarily by [[Marv Wolfman]] (following two issues each by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Archie Goodwin]] and [[Gardner Fox]]) and drawn by [[Gene Colan]] for [[Marvel Comics]] in the [[1970s]]. Mina Harker is a member of the ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', a [[pastiche]] [[comic book]], and film featuring numerous [[Victorian era|Victorian]] characters. One popular [[Elseworlds]] book by [[DC Comics]] is ''[[Batman and Dracula]]: Red Rain'', which features the caped crusader fighting Dracula, who has come to [[Gotham City]]. An animated movie called ''The Batman vs. Dracula'' pitting the two characters against one another aired on Cartoon Network and has been released on DVD.

In most [[videogame]]s of the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series (known as &quot;Akumajo Dracula&quot; in [[Japan]]), Count Vlad Tepes Dracula, as he is known in the series, is the ultimate source of evil that the protagonists must confront, after adventuring through Dracula's [[castle]].  The other aspect in relations to the Count is his son, Adrian Farenheights Tepes, commonly known as &quot;[[Alucard]]&quot;, who has dedicated his life to insure the survival of the human race and the preventing of his father's tyranny.  Now-defunct software company [[CRL Group PLC|CRL]] produced a series of games in the 1980s featuring classic horror classics including Dracula. These were the first game titles in the UK to receive [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] certification (they were rated &quot;15&quot;), normally reserved for films and videos. There were two adventure games, Dracula: Resurrection and The Last Sanctuary. Both took place after the novels end and continued Jon and Mina's fight against the Count. 

In the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'', the vampire [[Alucard]] (note: Dracula spelled backwards) is Dracula himself, having been magically bound into servitude to the [[Integra Hellsing|Hellsing family]] rather than being destroyed outright. Dracula has also appeared as a villain on the series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' 

In the manga and anime series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'' which takes place ten thousand years in the future, D's adversary Count Magnus discovers that D is the son of Dracula, the Ancient Ancestor.

Dracula has even been adapted for children's literature and entertainment, serving as the basis for several vampire cartoon characters over the years.  Dracula (or at least his portrayal by Bela Lugosi) is the basis for the [[Muppet]] character named [[Count von Count]] on ''[[Sesame Street]].'' Cartoon vampires based upon Dracula also include [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Count Duckula]]'', [[Filmation]]'s ''[[Quackula]]'', and [[Count Chocula]], the animated mascot of the [[breakfast cereal]] of the same name.

In addition, Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon all appeared in a 1980s movie called ''The Monster Squad'' in which a magical amulet, and it's survival or destruction every hundred years, will turn the tide one way or the other in the neverending struggle between the forces of good and evil. Dracula is at his deadly best in this film, surviving all the way to the end of the film, where he is shown battling Abraham Van Helsing in his final scene in the film.

The association of the book with the [[Yorkshire]] fishing village of [[Whitby]] has led to the staging of the twice-yearly [[Whitby Gothic Weekend]], an event that sees the town visited by [[Goth|Goths]] from all over Britain and occasionally from other parts of the world.

'''David Hume''' ([[April 26]], [[1711]] &amp;ndash; [[August 25]], [[1776]]*)  was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] and [[historian]]. Hume was one of the most important figures in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], along with friends [[Adam Smith]] and [[Thomas Reid]].  Many regard Hume as the third and most radical of the so-called [[British Empiricists]], after the [[England|English]] [[John Locke]] and the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[George Berkeley]]. 

Historians most famously see Humean philosophy as a thoroughgoing form of [[skepticism]], but many commentators have argued that the element of [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] has no less importance in Hume's philosophy. Hume scholarship has tended to oscillate over time between those who emphasize the sceptical side of Hume (such as Reid, [[Greene]], and the [[logical positivists]]), and those who emphasize the naturalist side (such as [[Don Garrett]], [[Norman Kemp Smith]], [[Kerri Skinner]], [[Barry Stroud]], and [[Galen Strawson]]).

Hume was heavily influenced by [[empiricist]]s [[John Locke]] and [[George Berkeley]], along with various [[French language|Francophone]] writers such as [[Pierre Bayle]], and various figures on the [[English language|Anglophone]] intellectual landscape such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], and [[Joseph Butler]].

The attempts to categorise Hume have reflected many of the current philosophical interests of their periods. They included &quot;''perhaps … only a very clever man&quot;'' ([[Taylor]], 1927*) , &quot;''positivist&quot;'' ([[Russell]], 1946*; [[Kolakowski]], 1968*), &quot;''cynical conservative&quot;'' ([[Stephen]], 1962*), &quot;''materialist&quot;'' ([[Anderson]], 1966*), &quot;''realist&quot;'' ([[Popper]], 1970*), &quot;''phenomenologist&quot;'' ([[Husserl]], 1970*), &quot;''naturalist&quot;'' ([[Stroud]], 1977*), &quot;''idealist&quot;'' ([[Ayer]], 1980*), &quot;''empiricist&quot;'' ([[Gregory]], 1981*; [[Livingston]], 1989*), &quot;''Pyrrhonian sceptic&quot;'' ([[Flew]], 1986*), &quot;''the prophet of the Wittgensteinian revolution&quot;'' ([[Phillipson]], 1989*), &quot;''neo-Hellenist&quot;'', ([[Penelhum]], 1993*), &quot;''the first post-sceptical philosopher of the early modern period&quot;'' ([[Norton]], 1993*), &quot;''radical perspectivalist&quot;'' ([[Fogelin]], 1993*). Hume’s own description of his position is one of &quot;''mitigated scepticism&quot;'' (Hume, 1777, 162*).

*''(N.B. The birthdate is [[May 7]] by the [[Gregorian calendar]] of his time; this date being used by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] when celebrating his birthday)''

==Career==
By his own account, Hume ''&quot;was born the 26th&amp;nbsp;April 1711, old style, at [[Edinburgh]]&quot;''.  From time to time throughout his life, he repaired to the family home at Ninewells by [[Chirnside]], [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]]. He was sent to the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of twelve, fourteen would have been more normal.  At first he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, ''&quot;an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while (my family) fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Vergil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring.&quot;'' He had little respect for professors telling a friend in [[1735]] &quot;''there is nothing to be learned from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books.&quot;''

At the age of eighteen, in [[1729]], Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him &quot;''a new scene of thought&quot;''. He did not recount what this was, but it seems likely to have been his theory of [[causality]] - that our beliefs about cause and effect depend on sentiment, custom and habit, and not upon [[reason]] or abstract, timeless, general [[Laws of Nature]]. 

In [[1734]], after a few months in commerce in Bristol, he retreated to do [[self-study]] and conduct [[thought experiments]] on himself at [[La Fleche]] in [[Anjou]], [[France]]. During his four years there, he laid out his life plan, as he wrote in ''[[My Own Life]]'', resolving &quot;''to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature.&quot;''  While there, he completed ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' at the age of twenty-six.  Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in the history of philosophy, the public in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] did not at first agree. Hume himself described the (lack of) public reaction to the publication of the ''Treatise'' in 1739&amp;ndash;40 by writing that it ''&quot;fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country&quot;''.There he wrote ''An Abstract Of A book lately published; Entituled, A Treatise Of human nature, &amp;c. Wherein The chief argument of that Book is farther illustrated and Explained''. Without revealing his authorship, he aimed to make his larger work more intelligible by shortening it. Even this advertisement failed to enliven interest in the ''Treatise''. 

After the publication of ''[[Essays Moral and Political]]'', in [[1744]] he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatics (psychology) at [[Edinburgh University]] but was rejected.  During the [[Jacobite Rebellion]] of [[1745]] he tutored the Marquise of Annandale. It was then that he started his great historical work ''[[The History of Great Britain]]'' which would take fifteen years and run to over a million words, to be published in six volumes in the period [[1754]] to [[1762]]. In [[1748]] he served, in uniform,  for three years as Secretary to [[General St Clair]] writing his ''Philosophical Essays concerning Human Understanding'' later published as ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]''.This did not prove much more successful than the ''Treatise''.

Hume was charged with [[heresy]] but he was defended by his young clerical friends who argued that as an [[atheist]] he lay outside the jurisdiction of the [[Church of Scotland|Church]]. Despite his acquittal, and, possibly, due to the opposition of [[Thomas Reid]] of [[Aberdeen]] who, that year, launched a telling Christian critique of his metaphysics, Hume failed to gain the Chair of Philosophy at [[University of Glasgow | Glasgow]]. It was in [[1752]], as he wrote in ''My Own Life'', that ''&quot;the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library.&quot;'' It was this resource that enabled him to continue his historical research for his ''History''. 

Hume achieved great literary fame as an essayist and historian. His enormous ''[[History of Great Britain]]'' from the [[Saxon]] kingdoms to the [[Glorious Revolution]]  was a best-seller in its day. In it, Hume presented political man as a creature of habit, with a disposition to submit quietly to established government unless confronted by uncertain circumstances. In his view, only religious difference could deflect men from their everyday lives to think about political matters. 

Hume's early essay ''[[Of Superstition and Religion]]'' laid the foundations for nearly all secular thinking about the history of religion. Critics of religion during Hume's time needed to express themselves cautiously. Less than 15 years before Hume was born, 18-year-old college student [[Thomas Aikenhead]] was put on trial for saying openly that he thought Christianity was nonsense, was convicted and hanged for [[blasphemy]].  Hume followed the common practice of expressing his views obliquely, through characters in dialogues. Hume did not acknowledge authorship of ''Treatise'' until the year of his death, in 1776.  His essays ''[[Of Suicide]]'', and ''[[Of the Immortality of the Soul]]'' and his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' were held from publication until after his death (published 1778 and 1779, respectively), and they still bore neither author's nor publisher's name. So masterful was Hume in disguising his own views that debate continues to this day over whether Hume was actually a [[deism|deist]] or an [[atheism|atheist]]. Regardless, in his own time Hume's alleged atheism caused him to be passed over for many positions.

There is an old (and probably false) story about David Hume and his supposed atheism.  In the story, Hume falls off his horse into a pool of mud and is slipping in it, when an old and pious lady walks past.  When she sees the renowned atheist flapping about for his life, she walks to the edge and looks at him.  Hume urges the lady to pass him a stick to pull him out, but she refuses unless he declare his devotion to [[God]] Almighty.  Hume accedes and the lady helps him out.

From [[1763]] to [[1765]] Hume was Secretary to [[Lord Hertford]] in [[Paris]], where he was admired by Voltaire and lionised by the ladies in society. He made friends with and, later, fell out with Rousseau. He wrote of his Paris life ''&quot;I really wish often for the plain roughness of the [[Poker Club]] of Edinburgh . . . to correct and qualify so much luciousness.&quot;''  For a year from [[1767]], Hume held the appointment of Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In [[1768]] he settled in [[Edinburgh]]. Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] credited Hume with awakening him from ''&quot;dogmatic slumbers&quot;''  (''circa'' 1770) and from then onwards he gained the recognition that he had craved all his life. 

Hume wrote his own epitaph:''&quot;Born 1711, Died [----]. Leaving it to posterity to add the rest.&quot;'' It is engraved with the year of his death [[1776]]  on the ''&quot;simple Roman tomb&quot;'' which he prescribed, and which stands, as he wished it, on the Eastern slope of the [[Calton Hill]] overlooking his home in the New Town of Edinburgh at No. 1 St David’s Street.

==Legacy==
Though Hume wrote in the [[18th century]], his work seems still uncommonly relevant in the philosophical disputes of today compared to that of his contemporaries. A summary of some of Hume's most influential work in philosophy might include the following::

===Ideas and impressions===
Hume believes that all human knowledge comes to us through our senses.  Our perceptions, as he called them, can be divided into two categories:  ideas and impressions.  He defines these terms thus in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'': &quot;By the term impression, then, I mean all our more lively perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire, or will. And impressions are distinguished from ideas, which are the less lively perceptions, of which we are conscious, when we reflect on any of those sensations or movements above mentioned.&quot;  He further specifies ideas, saying, &quot;It seems a proposition, which will not admit of much dispute, that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions, or, in other words, that it is impossible for us to think of anything, which we have not antecedently felt, either by our external or internal senses.&quot;  This forms an important aspect of Hume's [[Philosophical skepticism | skepticism]], for he says that we cannot be certain a thing, such as [[God]], a [[soul]], or a [[self]], exists unless we can point out the impression from which the idea of the thing is derived.

===The problem of causation===
When one event continually follows after another, most people think that a connection between the two events ''makes'' the second event follow from the first (post hoc ergo propter hoc). Hume challenged this belief in the first book of his ''Treatise of Human Nature'' and later in his ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''. He noted that although we do perceive the one event following the other, we do not perceive any [[necessary and sufficient conditions | necessary]] connection between the two. And according to his skeptical epistemology, we can only trust the knowledge that we acquire from our perceptions. Hume asserted that our idea of [[Causality|causation]] consists of little more than expectation for certain events to result after other events that precede them. Such a lean conception robs causation of all its force, and some later Humeans like [[Bertrand Russell]] have dismissed the notion of causation altogether as something akin to [[superstition]]. But this defies common sense, thereby creating the problem of causation &amp;ndash; what justifies our belief in a causal connection and what kind of connection can we have knowledge of?  &amp;ndash; a problem which has no accepted solution. Hume held that we (and other animals) have an [[instinct | instinctive]] belief in causation based on the development of habits in our [[nervous system]], a belief that we cannot eliminate, but which we cannot prove true through any argument, [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] or [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]], just as is the case with regard to our belief in the reality of the external world. 

For relevant contemporary work, see [[Beauchamp]] and [[Rosenberg]]'s ''[[Hume and the Problem of Causation]]'' and [[Wesley Salmon]] ''[[Causality and Explanation]]''.

===The problem of induction===
{{main|Problem of induction}}

Most of us think that the past acts as a reliable guide to the future. For example, [[physics|physicists']] laws of [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s work for describing past planetary behavior, so we presume that they will work for describing future planetary behavior as well.  But how can we justify this presumption &amp;ndash; the principle of [[induction (philosophy)|induction]]? Hume suggested two possible justifications and rejected them both:
# The first justification states that, as a matter of [[logical necessity]], the future must resemble the past. But, Hume pointed out, we can conceive of a chaotic, erratic world where the future has nothing to do with the past &amp;ndash; or, more tamely, a world just like ours right up until the present, at which point things change completely. So nothing makes the principle of induction logically necessary. 
# The second justification, more modestly, appeals only to the past reliability of induction &amp;ndash; it has always worked before, so it will probably continue to work. But, Hume pointed out, this justification uses [[circular reasoning]], justifying induction by an appeal that requires induction to gain any force. 

The problem of justifying induction remains with us. 
For relevant contemporary work, see [[Richard Swinburne]]'s compilation ''[[The Justification of Induction]]''.

===The bundle theory of the self===
We tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we've changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. After all, Hume pointed out, when you start introspecting, you notice a bunch of thoughts and feelings and perceptions and such, but you never perceive any substance you could call &quot;the self&quot;. So as far as we can tell, Hume concludes, there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting [[Bundle theory|bundle]] of perceptions. Note in particular that, on Hume's view, these perceptions do not ''belong to'' anything. Rather, Hume compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience.  (Note that in the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume said mysteriously that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, and yet he never returned to the issue!)

For relevant contemporary work, see [[Derek Parfit]]'s ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''.

===Practical reason: instrumentalism and nihilism===
Most of us find some behaviors more reasonable than others. Eating aluminum foil, for example, seems to have something unreasonable about it. But Hume denied that reason has any important role in motivating or discouraging behavior. After all, reason is just a sort of calculator of concepts and experience. What ultimately matters, Hume said, is how we feel about the behavior. His work is now associated with the doctrine of [[instrumental rationality|instrumentalism]], which states that an action is reasonable if and only if it serves the agent's goals and desires, whatever they be. Reason can enter the picture only as a lackey, informing the agent of useful facts concerning which actions will serve his goals and desires, but never deigning to tell the agent which goals and desires he should have. So, if you want to eat aluminum foil, reason will tell you where to find the stuff, and there's nothing unreasonable about eating it or even wanting to do so (unless, of course, one has a stronger desire for health or the appearance of sensibility). Today, however, many commentators argue that Hume actually went a step further to [[nihilism]] and said there's nothing unreasonable about deliberately frustrating your own goals and desires (&quot;I want to eat aluminum foil, so let me wire my mouth shut&quot;). Such behavior would surely be highly irregular, granting reason no role at all, but it would not be contrary to reason, which is important to make judgments in this domain.

For relevant contemporary work, see [[Jean Hampton]]'s ''[[The Authority of Reason]]'' and [[David Schmidtz]]'s ''[[Rational Choice and Moral Agency]]''.

===Moral anti-realism and motivation===
Drawing on his attack on reason's role in judging behaviour, Hume argues that immoral behaviour is not immoral by being against reason. He first claims that moral beliefs are intrinsically motivating &amp;ndash; if you believe killing is wrong, you will be ''[[ipso facto]]'' motivated not to kill and to criticise killing and so on (moral [[internalism and externalism|internalism]]). He then reminds us that reason alone can motivate nothing &amp;ndash; reason discovers matters of fact and logic, and it depends on our desires and preferences whether apprehension of those truths will motivate us. Consequently, reason alone cannot yield moral beliefs. Hume proposed that morality ultimately rests upon [[sentiment]], with reason only paving the way for our sensitive judgments by analysis of the moral matter in question. This argument against founding morality on reason is now one in the stable of moral [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] arguments; Humean philosopher [[J. L. Mackie | John Mackie]] argued that, for moral facts to be real facts about the world and, at the same time, intrinsically motivating, they would have to be very weird facts. So we have every reason not to believe in them.

For relevant contemporary work, see [[J. L. Mackie]]'s ''[[Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong]]'', Mackie's ''[[Hume's Moral Theory]]'', [[David Brink]]'s ''[[Moral Realism and the Foundation of Ethics]]'', and [[Michael Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith's]] ''[[The Moral Problem]]''.

===Free will versus determinism===
Just about everyone has noticed the apparent conflict between [[free will]] and [[determinism]] &amp;ndash; if your actions were determined to happen billions of years ago, then how can they be up to you? But Hume noted another conflict, one that turned the problem of free will into a full-fledged dilemma: free will is incompatible with indeterminism. Imagine that your actions are not determined by what events came before. Then your actions are, it seems, completely random. Moreover, and most importantly for Hume, they are not determined by your character &amp;ndash; your desires, your preferences, your values, etc. How can we hold someone responsible for an action that did not result from his character? How can we hold someone responsible for an action that randomly occurred? Free will seems to require determinism, because otherwise, the agent and the action wouldn't be connected in the way required of freely chosen actions. So now, nearly everyone believes in free will, free will seems inconsistent with determinism, and free will seems to require determinism. Hume's view is that human behavior, like everything else, is caused, and therefore holding people responsible for their actions should focus on rewarding them or punishing them in such a way that they will try to do what is morally desirable and will try to avoid doing what is morally reprehensible.  (See also [[Compatibilism]].)

For a critical analysis of Hume's arguments and general compatibilist strategy see, ''[[Paul Russell]]'s ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility''. For a relevant contemporary work, see [[Daniel C. Dennett]]'s ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.

===The is-ought problem===
Hume noted that many writers talk about ''what ought to be'' on the basis of statements about ''what is'' ([[is-ought problem]]). But there seems to be a big difference between descriptive statements (what is) and prescriptive statements (what ought to be). Hume calls for writers to be on their guard against changing the subject in this way without giving an explanation of how the ought-statements are supposed to follow from the is-statements. But how exactly can you derive an 'ought' from an 'is'? That question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.  (Others interpret Hume as saying not that one cannot go from a factual statement to an ethical statement, but that one cannot do so without going through human nature, that is, without paying attention to human sentiments.) Hume is probably one of the first writers to make the distinction between normative (what ought to be) and positive (what is) statements, which is so prevalent in social science and moral philosophy. [[G. E. Moore]] defended a similar position with his &quot;open question argument&quot;, intending to refute any identification of moral properties with natural properties&amp;mdash;the so-called &quot;[[naturalistic fallacy]]&quot;.

===Utilitarianism===
It was probably Hume who, along with his fellow members of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], first advanced the idea that the explanation of moral principles is to be sought in the [[utility]] they tend to promote. Hume's role is not to be overstated, of course; it was his countryman [[Francis Hutcheson]] who coined the [[utilitarian]] slogan &quot;greatest happiness for the greatest numbers&quot;. But it was from reading Hume's ''Treatise'' that [[Jeremy Bentham]] first felt the force of a utilitarian system: he &quot;felt as if scales had fallen from [his] eyes&quot;. Nevertheless, Hume's proto-utilitarianism is a peculiar one from our perspective. He doesn't think that the aggregation of cardinal units of utility provides a formula for arriving at moral truth. On the contrary, Hume was a moral sentimentalist and, as such, thought that moral principles could not be intellectually justified. Some principles simply appeal to us and others don't; and the reason why utilitarian moral principles do appeal to us is that they promote our interests and those of our fellows, with whom we sympathize. Humans are hard-wired to approve of things that help society &amp;ndash; public utility. Hume used this insight to explain how we evaluate a wide array of phenomena, ranging from social institutions and government policies to character traits and talents.

===The problem of miracles===
One way to support a religion is by appeal to [[miracle]]s. But Hume argued that, at minimum, [[miracle]]s could never give religion much support. There are several arguments suggested by Hume's essay, all of which turn on his conception of a miracle: namely, a violation of [[physics|the laws of nature]] by [[God]]. One argument claims that it's impossible to violate the laws of nature. Another claims that human testimony could never be reliable enough to countermand the evidence we have for the laws of nature. The weakest and most defensible claims that, due to the strong evidence we have for the laws of nature, any miracle claim is in trouble from the start, and needs strong supporting evidence to defeat our initial presumptions. In a slogan, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This point has been most applied to the question of the [[resurrection of Jesus]], where Hume would no doubt ask, ''&quot;Which is more likely &amp;ndash; that a man rose from the dead or that this testimony is mistaken in some way?&quot;'' Or, more blandly, ''&quot;Which is more likely &amp;ndash; that [[Uri Geller]] can really bend spoons with his mind or that there is some trick going on?&quot;'' This is somewhat similar to [[Occam's Razor]].  This argument is the backbone of the skeptic's movement and a live issue for historians of religion.
For a critical and technical ([[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]]) analysis of Hume, see [[John Earman]]'s ''[[Hume's Abject Failure]]'' &amp;ndash; the title of which gives you an idea of his assessment. For a rebuttal of Earman's interpretation of Hume, see [[Robert Fogelin]]'s ''[[A Defense of Hume on Miracles]]''. 
&lt;!-- not about Hume -- and Lewis abandoned his arguments after Anscombe vanquished them
In addition, [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Norman Geisler]], [[William Lane Craig]], and Christians who engage in jurisprudence [[Christian apologetics]] have argued that miracles are reasonable and plausible.

--&gt;

===The design argument===
One of the oldest and most popular [[existence of God|arguments for the existence of God]] is [[teleological argument|the design argument]] &amp;ndash; that all the order and 'purpose' in the world bespeaks a divine origin. Hume  gave the classic criticism of the design argument in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and though the issue is far from dead, many are convinced that Hume killed the argument for good. Here are some of his points:
#For the design argument to be feasible, it must be true that order and purpose are observed only when they result from design. But order is observed regularly, resulting from presumably mindless processes like snowflake or crystal generation. Design accounts for only a tiny part of our experience with order and 'purpose'.
#Furthermore, the design argument is based on an incomplete analogy: because of our experience with objects, we can recognise human-designed ones, comparing for example a pile of stones and a brick wall. But in order to point to a designed Universe, we would need to have an experience of a range of different universes. As we only experience one, the analogy cannot be applied.
#Even if the design argument is completely successful, it could not (in and of itself) establish a robust theism; one could easily reach the conclusion that the universe's configuration is the result of some morally ambiguous, possibly unintelligent agent or agents whose method bears only a remote similarity to human design.
#If a well-ordered natural world requires a special designer, then God's mind (being so well-ordered) ''also'' requires a special designer. And then this designer would likewise need a designer, and so on ''ad infinitum''. We could respond by resting content with an inexplicably self-ordered divine mind; but then why not rest content with an inexplicably self-ordered natural world? &lt;!-- Is it possible to form a ''reductio ad absurdum'' by assuming that God's mental state is inexplicable? I think that would make this point clearer.  How does Hume proceed? [[User:MrJones|Mr. Jones]] 19:19, [[13 July]] [[2004]] (UTC) --&gt;
#Often, what appears to be purpose, where it looks like object X has feature F in order to secure some outcome O, is better explained by a filtering process: that is, object X wouldn't be around did it not possess feature F, and outcome O is only interesting to us as a human projection of goals onto nature. This mechanical explanation of [[teleology]] anticipated [[natural selection]].  (see also [[Anthropic principle]])

For relevant contemporary work, see [[J. C. A. Gaskin]]'s ''[[Hume's Philosophy of Religion]]'', and Richard Swinburne's ''[[The Existence of God]]''; for a view from a philosopher of [[biology]], see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''[[Philosophy of Biology]]'', ch. 2.

===Conservatism and political theory===
Many regard David Hume as a political [[conservative]], sometimes calling him the first conservative philosopher. He expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled people not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious [[tyranny]]. However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and the [[Tories]], and he believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. He supported [[liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to [[democracy]], when suitably constrained. It has been argued that he was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the [[Federalist No. 10]] in particular. He was also, in general, an optimist about social progress, believing that, thanks to the economic development that comes with the expansion of trade, societies progress from a state of &quot;barbarism&quot; to one of &quot;civilisation&quot;. Civilised societies are open, peaceful and sociable, and their [[citizen]]s are as a result much happier. It is therefore not fair to characterise him, as [[Leslie Stephen]] did, as favouring &quot;that stagnation which is the natural ideal of a [[skeptic]]&quot;. (Leslie Stephen, History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, 2 vols. (London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1876), vol. 2, 185.)

Although strongly pragmatic, Hume produced an essay titled &quot;Towards a Perfect Commonwealth&quot;, where he detailed what any reforms should seek to achieve.  Strong features for the time included a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the [[clergy]].  The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[militia]] system was proposed as the best form of protection.  Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid, which was aimed at keeping the interests of [[constituent]]s in the minds of politicians.  

For more, see [[Douglas Adair]]'s ''[[That Politics May Be Reduced to a Science: David Hume, James Madison and the Tenth Federalist]]'' in ''[[Fame and the Founding Fathers]]''; [[Donald W Livingston]], ''[[Hume's Philosophy of Common Life]]''; [[John B Stewart]], ''[[Opinion and Reform in Hume's Political Philosophy]]''; [[Bradley C. S. Watson]], ''[[Hume, Historical Inheritance, and the Problem of Founding]]'' in ''[[The American Founding and the Social Compact]]''.

==Contributions to economic thought==
Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade.

Hume's idea on private property is special—private property was not a natural right, but is justified since it is a limited good. If all goods were unlimited and available freely, then private property would not be justified, but instead becomes an “idle ceremonial”. Hume also believed in unequal distribution of property, since perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry, which leads to impoverishment.

Hume did not believe that foreign trade produced specie, but considered trade a stimulus for a country’s economic growth. He did not consider the volume of world trade as fixed because countries can feed off their neighbor’s wealth, being part of a “prosperous community”. The fall in foreign demand is not that fatal, because in the long run, a country cannot preserve a leading trading position. 

Hume was among the first to develop automatic price-specie flow, an idea that contrasts the [[mercantile system]]. Simply put, when a country increases its in-flow of gold, this in-flow of gold wil result in price inflation, and then price inflation will force out countries from trading that would have traded before the inflation. This results in a decrease of the in-flow of gold in the long-run.

Hume also proposed a theory of beneficial inflation. He believed that increasing the money supply would raise production in the short run. This phenomenon was caused by a gap between the increase in the money supply and that of the price level. The result is that prices will not rise at first and may not rise at all. This theory was later proven by [[John Maynard Keynes]].

* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects.'' (1739&amp;ndash;40)
**Book 1:  &quot;Of the Understanding&quot;  His treatment of everything from the origin of our ideas to how they are to be divided.  Important statements of Scepticism.
**Book 2:  &quot;Of the Passions&quot;  Treatment of emotions.
**Book 3:  &quot;Of Morals&quot;  Moral ideas, justice, obligations, benevolence.
:Hume intended to see whether the ''Treatise'' met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success (as Hume himself said, &quot;It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots&quot;), and so was not completed.

* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748)
:Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will, miracles, and the argument from design.

* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751)
:Another reworking of material from the ''Treatise'' for more popular appeal.  Hume regarded this as the best of all his philosophical works, both in its philosophical ideas and in its literary style.

* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''  (posthumous)
:Discussion among three fictional characters concerning arguments for the existence of God, most importantly the argument from design.  Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most skeptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.

* ''[[Essays Moral and Political]]'' (first ed. 1741&amp;ndash;2)
:A collection of pieces written over many years and published in a series of volumes before being gathered together into one near the end of Hume's life. The essays are dizzying and even bewildering in the breadth of topics they address. They range freely over questions of aesthetic judgement, the nature of the British government, love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. However, certain important topics and themes recur, especially the question of what constitutes &quot;refinement&quot; in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]], manners, and morals. The Essays are written in clear imitation of [[Joseph Addison | Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.

* ''[[The History of England]]''  (1754&amp;ndash;62)
:This forms more a category of books than a single work, a monumental history spanning &quot;from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688&quot;. This work brought Hume the most fame during his own lifetime, going through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England until the publication of [[Thomas Macaulay]]'s own monumental ''History of England''.

* &quot;[[My Own Life]]&quot; (1776)
:Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of &quot;Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects&quot;.

L A Selby-Bigge provides, by means of an introduction to Hume's ''Enquiries'', a fascinating (and sometimes quite scathing) discussion of the various differences in the content and tone of Hume's ''Treatise'' and ''Enquiries''.

'''Dalton Trumbo''' ([[December 9]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[September 10]], [[1976]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]] and [[novelist]], and a member of the [[Hollywood Ten]], one of  group of film professionals who refused to testify before the [[1947]] [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] about alleged communist involvement. Though only convicted of [[contempt of Congress]], he was [[blacklist]]ed, and in 1950 spent 11 months in prison. 

Born in [[Montrose, Colorado]], Trumbo got his start working for Vogue magazine. He started in movies in [[1937]]; by the [[1940s]] he was one of Hollywood's highest paid writers for work on such films as 1940's ''[[Kitty Foyle]]'', for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]], ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), and ''[[Our Vines Have Tender Grapes]]'' (1945). 

After his blacklisting, he moved to Mexico with [[Hugo Butler]] and his wife [[Jean Rouverol]], who had also been blacklisted. There, Trumbo wrote thirty scripts under [[pseudonym]]s, such as the co-written ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1950) written under the pseudonym '''Millard Kaufman'''. He won an [[Academy_award|Oscar]] for ''[[The Brave One]]'' (1956), written under the name '''Robert Rich'''. 

In 1960 he received full credit (due in part to the efforts of actor [[Kirk Douglas]]) for the motion-picture epics ''[[Exodus (movie)|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Spartacus]]'', much to the chagrin of many conservatives/right wingers in the film industry, and thereafter on all subsequent scripts, and he was reinstated as a member of the [[Writers Guild of America]]. 

Trumbo's vivid [[anti-war]] novel, ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'', won a National Book Award (then known as an American Book Sellers Award) in [[1939]]. Shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Trumbo ordered all copies of ''Johnny Got His Gun'' to be recalled and stopped any further publication of the book. After receiving letters from individuals requesting copies of the book, Trumbo contacted the FBI and turned these letters over to them, questioning the correspondents' loyalty to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.

In [[1971]] Trumbo directed his own film adaptation of the novel, which starred [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Diane Varsi]] and [[Jason Robards]]. The inspiration for the novel came to Trumbo when he read an article about a [[United Kingdom|British]] officer who was horribly disfigured during [[World War I]]. One of his last films, ''[[Executive Action (movie)|Executive Action]]'', was based on various [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about the [[Kennedy assassination]].

His account and analysis of the [[Smith Act]] trials is entitled ''[[The Devil in the Book]]''. 

He is often quoted as having said, '''I never considered the working class anything other than something to get out of.'''

'''Delaware''' is a state in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It was one of the original 13 states and is known as the &quot;First State&quot; as it was the first of them to ratify the [[United States Constitution]]. It is a [[Mid-Atlantic]] state located on the western shore of the [[Delaware River]] and [[Delaware Bay]] and geographically is the second smallest state in the [[United States]]. The state capital is at [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and its major city is [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Delaware}}

===Native Americans===
Before Delaware was settled by [[Europeans]], the area was home to the  Eastern [[Algonquian]] tribes known as the Unami [[Lenape]] or [[Lenape|Delaware]] throughout the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] valley, and the [[Nanticoke]] along the rivers leading into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].  The Unami [[Lenape]] in the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] valley were closely related to Munsee [[Lenape]] tribes along the [[Hudson River]]. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the [[Susquehannock|Minqua]] or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the [[Delaware River]], and the destruction of the [[Susquehannock|Minqua]] by the [[Iroquois]] of the [[Five Nations]] in the [[1670]]'s,    the remnants of the [[Lenape]] left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid 18th century.

===Colonial Delaware===
The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first [[Europeans]] to settle in present day Delaware by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in [[1631]]. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  In [[1638]] a [[Sweden|Swedish]] trading post and colony was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by the Dutchman [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. Thirteen years later the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a new fort in [[1651]] at present day [[New Castle, Delaware]] and in [[1655]] took over the entire Swedish colony, incorporating it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]]s.

Only nine years later, in [[1664]], the Dutch were themselves forcibly removed by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] expedition under the direction of [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]]. Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cæcilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], Proprietor of [[Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in [[1682]]. Penn badly wanted an outlet to the sea for his [[Pennsylvania]] province and leased what were now known as the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot; from the Duke. 

Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in [[1682]]. However, by [[1704]] the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so much, their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle.  Penn and his heirs remained the Proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Deputy Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties.

===American Revolution===
Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially lacked much enthusiasm for a break with [[Great Britain]]. They had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their [[General Assembly|Colonial Assembly]] than other colonies. Nevertheless, there was strong objection to the seemingly arbitrary measures of [[Parliament]], and it was well understood that the territory's very existence as a separate entity depended upon its keeping step with its powerful neighbors, especially [[Pennsylvania]].

So it was that [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] lawyer, [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] native, [[John Dickinson (1732-1808)|John Dickinson]], became the &quot;Penman of the Revolution.&quot; Anticipating the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]], patriot leaders [[Thomas McKean]] and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the [[General Assembly|Colonial Assembly]] to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on [[June 15]], [[1776]], but the person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (1733-1798)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]].  Only the dramatic overnight ride of [[Caesar Rodney]] gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for Independence. Once the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration]] was adopted, however, [[George Read (1733-1798)|Read]] signed the document. 

Initially led by [[John Haslet (1727-1777)|John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the &quot;Delaware Blues&quot; and nicknamed the &quot;[[Blue Hen Chicken]]s.&quot; In August [[1777]] [[William Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was fought on [[September 3]], [[1777]], at Cooch's Bridge in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]]. It is believed to be the first time that the Stars and Stripes was flown in battle. 

Following the [[Battle of Brandywine]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] was occupied by the British and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The Britsh remained in control of the [[Delaware River]] for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]. Only the repeated military activities of [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[Caesar Rodney]] was able to control them.

Following the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central [[United States]] government with equal representation for each state. Once the [[Connecticut Compromise]] was reached creating a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the leaders in Delaware were able to easily secure ratification of the [[U.S. Constitution]] on [[December 7]], [[1787]], making Delaware the first state to do so.

===Slavery===
With two-thirds of the state settled by descendants of slave holding [[Maryland]] [[tobacco]] farmers, large parts of Delaware had a long tradition of acceptance of the institution of [[slavery]]. This was in spite of the fact that farmers increasingly had such little use for slaves that by the [[1860]] census there were only about 1,800 slaves in a state of 90,000 people, including nearly 20,000 free [[African Americans]]. When he freed his slaves in [[1777]], [[John Dickinson (1732-1808)|John Dickinson]] was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves.

The oldest black [[religious denomination|church]] in the country was chartered in Delaware by former-slave [[Peter Spencer]] in 1813 as the &quot;[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]],&quot; which is now the [[A.U.M.P. Church]].  The [[Big August Quarterly]] which began in 1814 is still celebrated and is the oldest such cultural festival in the country. 

During the [[American Civil War]], Delaware was a slave state that remained in the Union (Delaware voters voted not to secede on [[January 3]], [[1861]]). Delaware had been the first state to embrace the Union by ratifying the constitution, and would be the last to leave it, according to Delaware's governor at the time. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the War served in the regiments the State answered Lincoln's call to arms with, some did in fact serve in Delaware companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. 

Two months before the end of the Civil War, however, Delaware voted on [[February 18]], [[1865]] to reject the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the United States Constitution and so voted unsuccessfully to continue slavery beyond the Civil War. Delaware symbolically ratified the amendment on February 12, 1901&amp;mdash;40 years after [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Slavery ended in Delaware only when the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] took effect in December of 1865.  Delaware also rejected the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] during the [[Reconstruction]] Era.

== Law, government, and politics ==
[[Image:wiki_delaware.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Greetings from Delaware]]

Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in [[1897]], provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.

=== Legislative branch===
[[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members.  It sits in [[Dover, Delaware]], the State capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while Senators are elected to four-year terms.  The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the Governor.

===Judicial branch===
The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:
*The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court. 
*The Superior Court of Delaware is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.
*The [[Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.
*The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.
*The Court of Common Pleas has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.

Minor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.

Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]].  The Court of Chancery and the Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers.  In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs.  For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of public and private companies are [[Delaware corporation|incorporated in Delaware]].

===Executive branch===
The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]].  The present governor is [[Ruth Ann Minner]] (Democrat), who was elected as the state's first female governor in 2000.  The lieutenant governor is [[John C. Carney, Jr.]].  Delaware's U.S. Senators are [[Joe Biden|Joseph R. Biden, Jr.]] (Democrat) and [[Thomas R. Carper]] (Democrat).  Delaware's single US Representative is [[Michael N. Castle]] (Republican).

{{see|List of Governors of Delaware}}

===Politics===
Delaware has three counties: [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]. ''See: [[List of counties in Delaware]]''   Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues.  Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states -- such as courts, law enforcement, and the like -- have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government.

The Democratic Party holds a [[plurality]] of registrations in Delaware.  Until the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]] Presidential election, the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate for over 50 years in a row.  Bucking that trend, however, in 2000 and again in 2004 Delaware voted for the Democratic candidate.  [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight percentage points with 53.5% of the vote in 2004.

Historically, the Republican Party had an immense influence on Delaware politics, due in large part to the monied [[Du Pont family|du Pont family]].  This trend was so notable that [[Ralph Nader]] assembled a [[working group]] to investigate Delaware's political-industrial complex, resulting in a book published in [[1968]] entitled ''The Company State''.  As DuPont's might has declined, so has that of the Delaware Republican Party.  The Democrats have won the past four gubernatorial elections and currently hold six of the nine statewide elected offices (Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner, Attorney General, U.S. Representative-at-large, and two U.S. Senators).  However, this belies the fact that the Democratic Party gains most of its votes from heavily-developed New Castle County, whereas the lesser-populated Kent and Sussex Counties vote Republican.

== Geography == 
[[Image:datamil_de_map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Delaware]]

Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania, to the east by the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean and to the west and south by Maryland. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the far, or eastern, side of the Delaware River Estuary, and these small parcels share land boundaries with New Jersey. The largest city is [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and the capital is [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]]. 

The state of Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], a geographical unit stretching far down the Mid-Atlantic and into the South Atlantic Coast. 

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is highly unusual.  Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania is defined as an arc extending twelve miles from the [[cupola]] of the courthouse in [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and is referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]], being the only true-arc political boundary in the United States.  This border extends all of the way to the low-tide mark on the [[New Jersey]] shore, which continues down the shoreline until it again reaches the twelve-mile arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[thalweg]]) of the [[Delaware River]] [[Estuary]].  A portion of this arc extends into Maryland to the west, and the remaining western border is a tangent to this arc that runs a bit to the east.  The wedge of land between the arc and the Pennsylvania-Maryland border remained in dispute until [[1921]], when the land was given to Maryland.  The border between New Jersey and Delaware is still disputed.

===Topography===
Delaware lies on a level plain, the highest elevation being less than 450 feet above sea level.  The northern part is associated with the [[Piedmont (United States)|Appalachian Piedmont]] and is hilly, with a rolling surface.  South of Newark and Wilmington, the state follows the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground.  A [[ridge]] about 75 to 80 feet in altitude extends along the western boundary of the state and is the drainage divide between the two major watersheds of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] in the east and of several streams falling into [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the west.  The principal streams draining into the Delaware are the [[Christina River|Christina]] and the [[Brandywine Creek|Brandywine]] rivers.  The Christina is navigable for large ships as far as [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and for small ships as far as [[Newport, Delaware|Newport]].  The coast of [[Delaware Bay]] is marshy; the Atlantic coast has many sand beaches, enclosing shallow lagoons.  The largest of these are [[Rehoboth Bay]], [[Indian River Bay]], and a portion of [[St. Martin's Bay]].  The only harbors of consequence are Wilmington, [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], and New Castle.

===Climate===
Since the great majority of Delaware is a part of the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], the climate is moderated by the effects of the ocean.  The southern third of the state has a mild subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and mild winters.  The middle portion is the transition to the upper portion of the state, which has a warm continental climate and receives occasional winter snowfall.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Delaware_population_map.png|thumb|right|300px|Delaware Population Density Map]]

== Important cities ==
Wilmington is the state's largest city and its economic hub.  It is located within commuting distance of both Philadelphia and Baltimore.   Despite Wilmington's size, all regions of Delaware are enjoying phenomenal growth, with Dover and the beach resorts expanding immensely.

==Economy==
{{cleanup-date|October 2005}}
The gross state product of Delaware in 2003 was $49 billion.  The per capita personal income was $34,199, ranking 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation.

Delaware's agricultural output consists of [[poultry]], nursery stock, [[soybeans]], [[dairy]] products and [[maize|corn]]. Its industrial outputs include [[chemical]] products, [[processed food]]s, [[paper]] products, and [[rubber]] and [[plastic]] products.  Delaware's economy generally outperforms the national economy of the United States. 

The state's largest employers are concentrated in government (State of Delaware, New Castle County, University of Delaware), chemical and pharmaceutical companies ([[DuPont|E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.]], [[Syngenta]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Hercules, Incorporated]]), banking ([[MBNA]] America, [[Wilmington Trust Company]], [[First USA]] / [[Bank One]] / [[JPMorgan Chase]], AIG, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank), automotive manufacturing ([[General Motors]], [[DaimlerChrysler]]), and farming, specifically chicken farming in Sussex County (Perdue, Mountaire Farms).

The United States headquarters of [[ING Group]], and the U.S. operations of its online bank, ING Direct, are located in Wilmington, as are the world headquarters of [[MBNA]]. 

[[Dover Air Force Base]], just outside Dover, is one of the largest in the country and is a major employer in Central Delaware. In addition to its other responsibilities, the base serves as the entry point and [[mortuary]] for American military persons (and some U.S. government civilians) who die overseas.

==Transportation==
The transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation, also known as &quot;DelDOT&quot;.([http://www.deldot.gov/index.shtml])  DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware [[Adopt-a-Highway]] program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware [[Division of Motor Vehicles]], the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as &quot;DART First State&quot;, the state government public transportation organization), among others.  Almost ninety percent of the state's public roadway miles are under the direct maintenance of DelDOT which far exceeds the United States national average of twenty percent for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility; the remaining public road miles are under the supervision of individual municipalities.

One major branch of the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 95]], crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]].  In addition to I-95, there are seven [[principal highways]]: [[U.S. Highway 9]], [[U.S. Highway 13]], [[U.S. Highway 40]], [[U.S. Highway 113]], [[U.S. Highway 202]], [[U.S. Highway 301]], and [[Delaware Route 1]].  U.S. 13 and DE Rt. 1 are primary north-south highways connecting Wilmington and [[Pennsylvania]] with [[Maryland]], while U.S. 40, the primary east-west route, connects Maryland with New Jersey.  The state also operates two toll highways, the [[Delaware Turnpike]], which is Interstate 95 between Maryland and [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] and the [[Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway]], which is DE Rt. 1 between Dover and Interstate 95 between Wilmington and [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]].     

Delaware has around 1,450 bridges, of which ninety-five percent are under the supervision of DelDOT.  About thirty percent of all Delaware bridges were built prior to 1950 and about sixty percent of the number are included in the [[National Bridge Inventory]].  Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which is under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], which is under the bi-state [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]].  

The public transportation system, DART First State, was named &quot;Most Outstanding Public Transportation System&quot; in 2003 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]].  Coverage of the system is broad within New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex Counties.  The system includes bus, passenger rail, subsidized taxi and paratransit modes, the latter consisting of a state-wide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled.  Passenger rail service, like interstate highway service, is limited to a single southwest-to-northeast corridor in New Castle County.  Ferry service exists between [[Lewes, Delaware]] and [[Cape May, New Jersey]], across the mouth of the [[Delaware Bay]].

== Culture ==
=== Media ===
There are no network broadcast-television stations operating solely in Delaware. A public-television station from Philadelphia, WHYY, maintains a studio and broadcasting facility in Wilmington.  Philadelphia's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WPVI]], maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington.  The northern part of the state is served by network stations in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and the southern part by network stations in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Salisbury, Maryland]].  Salisbury's [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WBOC]], maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton.

=== Religion ===
Delaware is home to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Delaware]]. The [[A.U.M.P. Church]], the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington and still has a very substantial presence in the state.  Delaware also hosts an [[Islamic]] [[mosque]] in the [[Ogletown, Delaware|Ogletown]] area, as well as a [[Hindu]] temple in [[Hockessin, Delaware|Hockessin]]. 

[[Synagogues]] include Congregation Beth Emeth (Reform) in Wilmington, Congregation Beth El (Reform) in Newark, and Congregation Beth Shalom (Conservative) in Wilmington, Congregation Beth Sholom (Conservative) in Dover, and Adas Kodesh Shel Emeth (Traditional) in Wilmington.

=== Sports ===
Delaware's  professional sports teams are the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]] [[minor league baseball]] team, a Class A affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]] who play at [[Daniel S. Frawley Stadium]], and the [[Delaware Griffins]], part of the [[Women's Professional Football League]]. Delaware is also home to the Delaware Smash who play [[World Team Tennis]]. The Smash were led in 2005 by [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion [[Venus Williams]].

In place of in-state professional sports teams, many Delawareans follow either [[Philadelphia]], [[New Jersey]], or [[Baltimore]] teams, depending on their location within the state, with Philadelphia teams receiving the largest fan following.  In addition, the [[University of Delaware]]'s football team has a loyal following, with [[Delaware State University]]'s team enjoying popularity on a much lesser scale.

Delaware is home to [[Dover International Speedway]] and [[Dover Downs]].  DIS, also known as the ''Monster Mile'', hosts two [[NASCAR]] races each year.  Dover Downs is a popular [[harness racing]] facility.  In what may be the only co-located horse and car-racing facility in the nation, the Dover Downs track is located inside the DIS track.

Delaware has been home to professional wrestling outfit [[CZW]], particularly the annual Tournament of Death.

=== Festivals ===
The [[Big August Quarterly]] is an annual religious festival held in Wilmington, Delaware, and is sometimes called &quot;Big Quarterly&quot; or &quot;August Quarterly&quot;.  The festival began in [[1814]] by [[Peter Spencer]]  in connection with the &quot;quarterly&quot; meeting (or &quot;conference&quot;) of the [[Spencer Churches|African Union Church]].  Out of the four meetings during the year, the one in August became the &quot;annual conference&quot; of the Church when ministers' assignments for the next year were announced, among other business -- it was a time for free blacks and slaves alike to come together (from the multi-state area) and celebrate their faith with singing, dancing, testifying, and feasting. It is the oldest such celebration in the country. Senator Biden's remarks on the significance of the &quot;Big Quarterly&quot; were published in the ''Congressional Record for'' [[30 July]] [[1981]] (Vol. 127, No. 117) and for [[9 August]] [[1984]] (Vol 130, No. 106).

Every year, the [[Delaware Sängerbund]] ([[German language|German]] for ''Singers Alliance'') holds a three day long [[Oktoberfest]].  Although the cultural significance of the Sängerbund has diminished over the years, the festival is extremely popular and attracts visitors from all over the East Coast.

The city of Wilmington is home to several ethnic festivals, including the Puerto Rican Festival, which includes a parade, the Polish Festival, the Greek Festival held at the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Italian Festival. Wilmington's substantial [[Polish-American]] population supports a yearly [[Casimir Pulaski Day|Pulaski Day]] Parade in March as well as a summer Polish Festival, hosted by [[Hedwig of Poland|Saint Hedwig]]'s Roman Catholic Church.  The Italian Festival is held in an area of Wilmington known as Little Italy by Saint Anthony's Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, and covers several blocks. It runs from sunup to sundown for a week, and features Italian food, merchandise, live music, bars, amusement park rides, and the All Saints parade on the closing night of the festival.

In [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]], the end of the summer season is honored each year with a traditional [[jazz funeral]] down the town's [[boardwalk]].  And at the end of October, [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]] holds its annual &quot;Sea Witch Halloween and Fiddlers' Festival&quot;.

One of Delaware's most bizarre -- and enjoyable -- traditions is Sussex County's [[Punkin Chunkin]], where unused pumpkins from the Halloween season are ejected almost one mile high in the air by [[hydraulic]] or air-powered cannons.  Putatively a competition to see which team can create the most powerful cannon, it is also a popular occasion for drinking and [[tailgate]] parties.

== Education ==
Delaware was the origin of ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'', one of the four cases which was combined into [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision that led to the end of [[racial segregation|segregated]] public schools.  Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found '''for''' the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation was unconstitutional.  Even more ironically, Delaware's segregated school system was substantially supported by donations from the wealthy [[Du Pont family|du Pont family]] beginning with the Civil War, when the [[DuPont|Du Pont Company]]'s profits grew thanks to a high demand for its gunpowder products.

Unlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions.  A statewide [[standardized test]], the Delaware Student Testing Program (DSTP), was implemented to comply with the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].

A &quot;three-tiered diploma&quot; system fostered by Governor Ruth Ann Minner, which awarded &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;, and &quot;distinguished&quot; high-school diplomas based on a student's performance in the Delaware State Testing Program, was recently discontinued by the General Assembly after many Delawarians questioned its fairness.

===Other places named Delaware===
{{see|Delaware (disambiguation)}}

There are cities, towns, boroughs, townships, and counties named &quot;Delaware&quot; in the states of [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], and several &quot;Delawares&quot; in each of the states of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]].  There's even a &quot;Delaware&quot; in the province of [[Ontario|Ontario, Canada]].

The [[Delaware River]] is a major river in the eastern United States, rising in [[New York]] State, forming the boundary between [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]], and emptying into [[Delaware Bay]], which separates New Jersey from the state of Delaware.

===Delaware Native Americans===
'''Delaware''' is also the name of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] group (called in their own name [[Lenni Lenape]]) that was very influential in the dawning days of the United States.  A band of the Nanticoke tribe of Indians still remains in Sussex County.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses}} ''For the sister project [[Wiktionary]], see [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page http://wiktionary.org/].''

A '''dictionary''' is a list of words with their definitions, a list of characters with their [[glyph]]s, or a list of words with corresponding words in other languages. In some languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]] form appears as the main word or headword in most dictionaries. Many dictionaries also provide [[pronunciation]] information; [[grammar|grammatical]] information; word derivations, histories, or [[etymology|etymologies]]; illustrations; usage guidance; and examples in phrases or sentences. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book.
[[Image:Latin_dictionary.jpg|thumb|250px|multi-volume Latin dictionary in the [[University Library of Graz]]]]

==Word order==

Today, dictionaries of languages with [[alphabet]]ic and syllabic [[writing system]]s list words in alphabetical or some analogous phonetic order. Words and characters in [[ideographic]] writing systems such as [[Chinese character|Chinese]] are sorted according to one of numerous schemes based on the components, number of [[Stroke order|strokes]], overall shape, or pronunciation of each character. Due to the nature of Chinese characters, linear sorts are particularly unsuitable for Chinese dictionaries. ''(See [[collation]] for more information on linguistic sorting).''

The first English alphabetical dictionary came out in [[1604]] and alphabetical ordering was a rarity until the [[18th century]].  Before alphabetical listings, dictionaries were organized by topic, i.e. a list of animals all together in one topic.

==Pronunciation==

Dictionaries have had a variety of means of expressing the means of pronouncing words in those languages that are not entirely phonetic. Three different methods are common. 

The earliest was simply to indicate the syllables that have greater stress using accent marks, such as in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s eighteenth century dictionary. Here the accent mark followed the stressed syllable. This is analogous to the tonal marks for Chinese or the [[accent nucleus]] for Japanese. Regular languages such as Spanish do not need any special marking for this purpose. 

For languages that have no official standard pronunciation, like English or German, a system of [[respelling]] was introduced with the letters given [[diacritic]]s, also known as accent marks, (e.g., [[macron]]s, [[tilde]]s, [[breve]]s, [[circumflex]]es) that do not occur in ordinary writing, to assist the reader in pronouncing the words. These had the additional capacity for accepting regional differences, especially in a federal society. For example, most Americans pronounce the first vowel in one group of words such as &quot;ask&quot; and &quot;dance&quot; in one manner, while it is standard for the English to pronounce them in a consistently different manner. Some dictionaries before 1970 added an accent mark of one dot atop the letter &quot;a,&quot; which specifies this choice, rather than either one definitively. 

Finally, totally new [[phonetic alphabet]]s such as [[IPA]] were devised, especially for those languages like French which have an official pronunciation. These use an accent mark that precedes a stressed syllable. It is also used to indicate only one preferred pronunciation, such as [[Received pronunciation|RP]] or [[General American]], for foreigners to learn the language or for domestic people to alter their dialect. Currently this system has prestige, but it cannot easily interrelate dialectic variations.

==Coverage==

Dictionaries vary wildly in size and scope. A dictionary that attempts to cover as many words from a particular speech community as possible is called a [[maximizing dictionary]] (e.g. the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), whereas a dictionary that attempts to cover only a limited selection of words from a speech community is called a [[minimizing dictionary]] (e.g. a dictionary containing the 2000 most frequently used words in the English language).

==Special-purpose dictionaries==

There are many different types of dictionaries, including bilingual, multilingual, historical, biographical, and geographical dictionaries.

===Bilingual dictionaries===

In [[Bilingual dictionary|bilingual dictionaries]], each entry has translations of words in another language. For example, in a Japanese-English dictionary, the entry ''tsuki'' has the corresponding English word, ''moon.''  In dictionaries between English and a language using a non-[[Roman alphabet|Roman]] script, entry words in the non-English language may be either printed and sorted in the native order, or [[Romanization|romanized]] and sorted in Roman alphabetical order.

===Specialized dictionaries===

Specialized dictionaries (also referred to as technical dictionaries) focus on linguistic and factual matters relating to specific subject fields. A [[specialized dictionary]] may have a relatively broad coverage, e.g. a [[picture dictionary]], in that it covers several subject fields such as science and technology (a [[multi-field dictionary]]), or their coverage may be more narrow, in that they cover one particular subject field such as law (a [[single-field dictionary]]) or even a specific sub-field such as contract law (a [[sub-field dictionary]]). Specialized dictionaries may be [[Maximizing dictionary|maximizing dictionaries]], i.e. they attempt to achieve comprehensive coverage of the terms in the subject field concerned, or they may be [[Minimizing dictionary|minimizing dictionaries]], i.e. they attempt to cover only a limited number of the specialized vocabulary concerned. Generally, multi-field dictionaries tend to be minimizing, whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to be maximizing. See also [[LSP dictionary]].

===Character dictionaries===

In East Asian languages, a dictionary form for [[Chinese character|Han (Chinese) characters]] has developed, called ''Kan-wa jiten'' (literally 'Han-Japanese dictionary') in Japanese and ''Okpyeon'' ('Jewel Book') in Korean.  Each entry has one Chinese character with information about [[stroke (Chinese character)|stroke]] count and order, readings (pronunciations), and a list of words using that character.

===Data dictionaries===

Data sets and databases collected and utilized for statistical analysis are typically accompanied by, or able to be used to generate, a list of all [[variable]] names used within the data set, as well as matters such as their meaning, values, [[level of measurement]], length, decimal allowances, and stype (numeric, string, etc.)

===Glossaries===

Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine or science. The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language.  In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words.  With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

==Variations between dictionaries==

===Prescription and description===

Dictionary makers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) is ''descriptive'', and attempts to describe the actual use of words.  [[Noah Webster]], on the other hand, intent on forging a distinct identity for the [[American language]], altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of numerous words.  This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling &quot;color&quot; while the rest of the world uses &quot;colour&quot;.  (See [[American and British English differences]].)  While disapproved of in the UK, the US spellings are universally understood; likewise the British spellings are not acceptable in America.

While descriptivists would charge that prescriptivism is an unnatural attempt to dictate usage or curtail change,  prescriptivists would argue that to document, without judgment, usages which they consider improper or inferior sanctions those usages by default, causing the language to deteriorate in practice.  Although much is made of these differing views, they usually apply to a very small number of controversial words, while not affecting the vast majority for which there is common agreement.  But the softening of usage notations, from the previous edition, for two words, ''ain't'' and ''irregardless,'' out of over 450,000 in [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]] in [[1961]], was enough to provoke outrage among many with prescriptivist leanings, who branded the dictionary as &quot;permissive.&quot;  

The prescriptive/descriptive issue has been given so much consideration in modern times that most dictionaries of English apply the descriptive method to definitions, while additionally informing readers of attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.  ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''nonstand'' (nonstandard.)  [[American Heritage Dictionary|''American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous &quot;usage notes.&quot;   [[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|''Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, &quot;an offensive term for...&quot; or &quot;a taboo term meaning...&quot;

Because of the broad use of dictionaries, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity.  In the long run, however, usage primarily determines the meanings of words in English, and the language is being changed and created every day.  As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to &quot;El otro, el mismo&quot;: &quot;''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define.  The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''&quot;

===Other variations===

Since words and their meanings develop over time, dictionary entries are organized to reflect these changes.  Dictionaries may either list meanings in the historical order in which they appeared, or may list meanings in order of popularity and most common use.  

Dictionaries also differ in the degree to which they are ''encyclopedic'', providing considerable background information, illustrations, and the like, or ''linguistic'', concentrating on etymology, nuances of meaning, and quotations demonstrating usage.

Any dictionary has been designed to fulfil one or more functions. The dictionary functions chosen by the maker(s) of the dictionary provide the basis for all lexicographic decisions, from the selection of entry words, over the choice of information types, to the choice of place for the information (e.g. in an article or in an appendix). There are two main types of function. The communication-oriented functions comprise text reception (understanding), text production, text revision, and translation. The knowledge-oriented functions deal with situations where the dictionary is used for acquiring specific knowledge about a particular matter, and for acquiring general knowledge about something. The optimal dictionary is one that contains information directly relevant for the needs of the users relating to one or more of these functions. It is important that the information is presented in a way that keeps the [[lexicographic information cost]]s at a minimum.

==History==

The art and craft of writing dictionaries is called [[lexicography]].  

One of the earliest dictionaries known, and which is still extant today in an abridged form, was written in [[Latin]] during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]].  It is known by the title &quot;De Significatu Verborum&quot; (&quot;On the meaning of words&quot;) and was originally compiled by [[Verrius Flaccus]].  It was twice abridged in succeeding centuries, first by [[Festus]], and then by [[Paul the Deacon]].  Verrius Flaccus' dictionary was an abridged list of difficult or antiquated words, whose usage was illustrated by quotations from early Roman authors.

''[[Shuo Wen Jie Zi]]'' (说文解字), written in the early [[2nd century]], was the first [[Chinese language]] dictionary. The author [[Xu Shen]] first organized [[Chinese characters]] by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]].

The first true English dictionary was the ''[[Table Alphabeticall]]'' of [[1604]], although it only included 3,000 words and the definitions it contained were little more than synonyms. The first one to be at all comprehensive was [[Thomas Blount (Lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s dictionary ''Glossographia'' of [[1656]].  This was followed by [[Samuel Johnson]]'s famous and more complete dictionary of [[1755]].

In [[1806]], Noah [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's dictionary]] was published by the G&amp;C Merriam Company of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] which still publishes ''Merriam-Webster'' dictionaries, but the term ''Webster's'' is considered generic and can be used by any dictionary.

The most complete dictionary of the English language is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. The first edition was properly begun in 1860 and was completed in 1928, by which time a supplement that took an additional five years to complete was already necessary.

==Miscellaneous==

The Irish mathematical physicist, [[John Lighton Synge|J. L. Synge]], created a game, [[Game of Circ]], to emphasize the circular reasoning implicit in the defining process of any standard dictionary.

'''Daffodils''' form a group of large-[[flower]]ed members of the genus ''[[Narcissus (flower)|Narcissus]]''. Most daffodils look yellow, but yellow-and-white, yellow-and-orange, white-and-orange, pink, and lime-green [[cultivar]]s also exist. Daffodils grow [[perennial plant | perennially]] from [[bulb]]s. In temperate climates they flower among the earliest blooms in [[spring (season) | spring]]: to this extent daffodils both represent and herald spring. They often grow in large clusters, covering lawns and even entire hillsides with yellow.

All daffodils have a central trumpet-shaped [[corona (disambiguation) | corona]] surrounded by a ring of [[petal]]s. The traditional daffodil has a golden yellow color all over, but the corona may often feature a contrasting color. Breeders have developed some daffodils with a double or triple row of petals, making them resemble a small golden ball. Other cultivars have frilled petals, or an elongated or compressed central corona.

All daffodils belong to the genus ''Narcissus''. Daffodil is the common English name for them all, and Narcissus is the Latin, botanical name for them all.  Some people refer to daffodils as &quot;[[jonquil]]s&quot;, from the Spanish name for the flower, although properly this name belongs only to hybrids of ''[[Narcissus jonquilla]]''.

The daffodil serves the national flower of [[Wales]]. One species, ''[[Narcissus obvallaris]]'', grows only in a small area around [[Tenby]]. In [[Wales]] it is traditional to wear a daffodil on [[Saint David's Day]] ([[1 March]]).

In the [[language of flowers]], daffodils signify [[chivalry]] and/or [[respect]].  

The name of the flower is derived from an earlier &quot;affodell&quot;, a variant of [[asphodel]]. The reason for the introduction of the initial &quot;d&quot; is not known, though from at least the sixteenth century  &quot;Daffadown Dilly&quot; or &quot;daffadowndilly&quot; has appeared as a playful synonym of the name.

[[William Wordsworth]]'s short poem &quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud&quot; has often become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils which form its main image.

      <comment>/* Traits of dystopian fiction */ fix link to &quot;We&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the philosophical concept and literary form.  For the Half-Life 2 mod, see [[Dystopia (computer game)]]''.

A '''dystopia''' (alternatively, '''cacotopia''', '''kakotopia''' or '''anti-utopia''') is usually seen as the [[antithesis]] of a [[utopia]]n [[society]]. 

A dystopian society is usually characterized by an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[form of government]], or some other kind of [[oppression|oppressive]] [[social control]].

The first use of the word has been credited to [[John Stuart Mill]], whose knowledge of Greek would suggest that he meant it as a place where things are bad, rather than simply the opposite of Utopia. The Greek prefix 'dys'/'dis' signifies 'ill','bad' or 'abnormal', whereas 'ou' means 'not' ([[Utopia]] means 'nowhere', and is a pun on 'Eutopia' meaning 'happy place' - the prefix 'eu' means 'well'). So 'dystopia' and 'utopia' are not exact opposites in the sense that [[dysphoria]] and [[euphoria]] are opposites.

== Common traits of a dystopian society==

A dystopian society usually exhibits at least one of the following traits from the following non-exhaustive list:

* An apparent Utopian society, free of poverty, disease, conflict, and even unhappiness.  Scratching the surface of the society, however, reveals exactly the opposite.  The exact problem, the way the problem is suppressed, and the chronology of the problem forms the central conflict of the story.
* [[Social stratification]], where [[social class]] is strictly defined and enforced, and [[social mobility]] is non-existent (see [[caste system]]).
* A [[nation-state]] ruled by an [[upper class]] with few democratic ideals
* State [[propaganda]] programs and educational systems that coerce most [[citizen]]s into worshipping the state and its [[government]], in an attempt to convince them into thinking that life under the [[regime]] is good and just, e.g. [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''
* Strict conformity among citizens and the general assumption that dissent and individuality are bad
* A state figurehead that people worship fanatically through a vast [[personality cult]], such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]],  ''[[We (novel)|We]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s The Benefactor, or ''[[Equilibrium (2002 film)|Equilibrium]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Father]]
* A fear or disgust of the world outside the state.
* A common view of traditional life, particularly organized religion, as primitive and nonsensical
* Alternatively, complete domination by a state religion, e.g [[Ingsoc]] in the [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]] of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the [[Sisterhood of Metacontrol]] in ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', the [[Technopriests]] in ''[[The Incal]]'' or [[fundamentalist Christianity]] (with elements of [[Christian reconstructionism|reconstructionism]]) in ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''
* The &quot;memory&quot; of institutions overriding or taking precedence over human memory
* A penal system that lacks due process laws and often employs psychological or physical torture, e.g. [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''
* A lack of the key essentials of life for many citizens, like food shortages
* Constant surveillance by government or other agencies, e.g. [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''
* Absence or else total co-option of an educated middle class (i.e. teachers, journalists, scientists) who might criticize the regime's leadership
* Militarized police forces and private security forces
* The banishment of the natural world from daily life
* Construction of fictional views of reality that the populace are coerced into believing
* Corruption, impotence or other usurpation of democratic institutions
* Fictional rivalries between groups that actually operate as a cartel
* Insistence by the forces of the establishment that:
** It provides the best of all possible worlds 
** All problems are due to the action of its enemies and their dupes
* An overall slow decay of all systems (political, economic, religion, infrastructure. . .) resulting from people being alienated from nature, the State, society, family, and themselves. Yesterday was better, tomorrow will be worse.
* Everything tends towards [[zero sum]] gain relationships rather than non-zero-sum relationships in a slowly decreasing system.
In dystopian societies, the economic system is one that centers around stability and is structured so that the government or the economic system is immune to change or disruption.  Usually, the industries operate at maximum efficiency and capacity, and then the excess products or currency is absorbed in some way by the state.  In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' people are put on rations and the excess that is produced is absorbed in the &quot;war&quot; that is always occurring with either [[Eurasia]] or [[Eastasia]].  In ''[[Brave New World]]'' the excess produced is sucked up in the extreme consumerism of the population, encouraged by the government.  In ''[[We]]'' the [[One State]] there is no currency or exchange whatsoever, either inside or outside the walls of the society, but everything is provided to the people.

== Traits of dystopian fiction ==

Many films and literature featuring dystopian societies exhibit at least a few of the following traits:

* A selectively-told [[back story]] of a war, revolution, uprising, spike in [[overpopulation]], natural disaster or some other climactic event which resulted in dramatic changes to society
* A standard of living among the lower and middle class that is generally poorer than in contemporary society. This is not always the case, however &amp;mdash; in ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Equilibrium (2002 film)|Equilibrium]]'', people enjoy much higher material living standards in exchange for the loss of other qualities in their lives, such as independent thought and emotional depth.
* A protagonist who questions the society, often feeling intuitively that something is terribly wrong, such as [[V]] from [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.
* Necessarily, if it is based on our world, a shift in emphasis of control, e.g. to corporations, autocratic cliques or bureaucracies.
* Because dystopian literature takes place in the future, it often features technology more advanced than that of contemporary society.  Usually, the advanced technology is controlled exclusively by the group in power, while the oppressed population is limited to technology comparable to or more primitive than what we have today.

For the reader to engage with it, dystopian fiction typically has one other trait: familiarity. It is not enough to show people living in a society that seems unpleasant. The society must have echoes of today, of the reader's own experience. If the reader can identify the patterns or trends that would lead to the dystopia, it becomes a more involving and effective experience. Authors can use a dystopia effectively to highlight their own concerns about societal trends. For example, [[George Orwell]] originally based the title of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' on the year it was written (1948), because he saw the world he describes emerging in austere postwar [[Europe]].  In similar fashion, [[Ayn Rand]] wrote ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' as a warning against what she saw as the subordination of individual human beings to the state or &quot;the We.&quot; [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' as a warning against the rise of religious fundamentalist totalitarianism in the United States and the hypocrisy of 1970s feminism actually aiding the cause of their worst enemies.

Dystopian fiction is often (but not always) ''unresolved''. That is, the narrative may deal with individuals in a dystopian society who are unsatisfied, and may rebel, but ultimately fail to change anything. Sometimes they themselves end up changed to conform to the society's norms. This narrative arc to a sense of hopelessness in such classic dystopian works as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. It contrasts with much fiction of the future, in which a [[hero]] succeeds in resolving conflicts or otherwise changing things for the better.

There is usually a group of people somewhere in the society who are not under the complete control of the state, and in whom the hero of the novel usually puts his or her hope, although he or she still fails to change anything.  In ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] they are the &quot;proles&quot; (short for &quot;[[proletariat]]&quot;), in ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] they are the people on the reservation, and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Zamyatin]] they are the people outside the walls of the [[One State]].

==Criticism of the concept of dystopias==

Just as most modern philosophers, political theorists, and writers have dismissed the idea of the perfect society or &quot;utopia&quot;, many have also expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of a real-life dystopia of the kind described by Orwell and others. Although there have been many absolutist states in human history, writers such as [[Gregg Easterbrook]] and others have pointed out that such societies tend to rapidly self-destruct or be destroyed by neighbors. [[Dictatorship]]s and similar regimes tend to be short-lived as their policies and actions are almost continually leading to the creation of new potential opponents. For example, the killing or &quot;[[forced disappearance|disappearance]]&quot; of critics or activists only serves to anger their family or friends, who in turn continue the struggle against the regime and so on. 

Absolutist states with [[socialist]] leanings often fail, it is argued, as a result of the unworkable nature of an [[economic system]] which fails to meet the need of the populations for food, work or income, rather than as a result of direct [[persecution]] of their own citizens.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diatomic molecules''' are molecules formed of exactly two [[atom]]s, of the same or different [[chemical element]]s. '''Diatomic elements''' are those that almost exclusively exist as diatomic molecules, known as '''homonuclear''' diatomic molecules in their natural elemental state when they are not [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] with other elements. Examples include H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Earth's atmosphere]] is comprised almost completely (99%) of diatomic [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (21%) and [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (78%).  The remaining 1% is predominantly argon (0.9340%)

Oxygen also exists as the ''triatomic'' molecule [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The diatomic elements are [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and the [[halogen]]s: [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]]. Astatine is so rare in nature (its most stable [[isotope]] has a [[half-life]] of only 8.1 hours) that it is usually not considered.

The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non polar and fully [[Covalent bond|covalent]].

Examples of '''heteronuclear''' diatomic molecules include [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[nitric oxide]] (NO).

      <comment>/* Duopoly Models in Economics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A true '''duopoly''' is a form of [[oligopoly]] where only two producers exist in a [[market]].  In reality, this definition is generally eased whereby two firms must only have dominant control over a [[market]].  In the field of [[industrial organization]], it is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity.  

== Duopoly Models in Economics ==

There are two principal duopoly models, [[Cournot duopoly]] and [[Bertrand duopoly]]:

*The '''[[Cournot]]''' model, which shows that two firms react to one another's production (quantity) changes until they reach a [[Nash equilibrium]].
*The '''[[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]]''' model, in which, in a game of two firms, each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a [[Nash Equilibrium]].

== Politics ==

Modern [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] has been described as a duopoly since the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties have dominated and framed [[policy]] debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half. [[Third Parties]] have encountered various obstacles to getting onto ballots at different levels of government, more so in recent decades.

''See [[List of political parties in the United States]] for a more comprehensive look at the politics of the [[Two-party system]],  [[Duverger's law]].''

==Broadcasting==

'''Duopoly''' is also used in the broadcast television and radio industry, referring to a single company owning two outlets in the same city. In the United States, this has been frowned upon when using public airwaves, as it gives too much influence to one company. In [[Canada]], this definition is more commonly called a &quot;[[twinstick]]&quot;.

'''''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&amp;D''''' or '''''DnD''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[tabletop role-playing game |tabletop]]  [[role-playing game]] (RPG) published by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], was first published in January 1974 by Gygax's company, [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR). Originally derived from [[tabletop wargame]]s, this publication is generally regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games, and by extension, the role-playing game industry. 
Players of ''D&amp;D'' invent fictitious characters who embark upon imaginary adventures in which they battle many kinds of fictional monsters, gather treasure, and earn [[experience points]] as the game progresses. The game departed from traditional wargaming by assigning each player a specific character to play, as opposed to legions and armies. It also developed the concept of a [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) or [[Gamemaster]] (GM), the storyteller and referee responsible for creating the fictional setting of the game, moderating the actions of the players' characters, and playing the supporting cast of [[non-player character]]s.

The early success of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' quickly led to a proliferation of similar game systems, such as [[RuneQuest]], [[Tunnels and Trolls]], [[Traveller]], and [[Arduin]]. Despite this competition, ''D&amp;D'' has continued to dominate the role-playing game industry throughout its existence, enjoying a nearly impenetrable market position. In [[1977]] the game was split into two slightly different versions: the simpler ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and the more complex '''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''AD&amp;D''''' or '''''ADnD''''').  In [[2000]], the simplified version of the game was discontinued and the 3rd Edition of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was released as a major revision of the ''AD&amp;D'' game. The current version of the game, released in July [[2003]] is ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5'' (also known as the Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&amp;D3.5'').

[[As of 2006]], ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' remains the best-known and best-selling role-playing game, with an estimated 20 million players worldwide and over [[United States dollar|US$]]1 [[billion]] in book and equipment sales (according to a BBC news report). Products branded ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' made up over fifty percent of the RPG products sold in 2002{{citeneeded}}. Outside of the gaming community, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; has become a [[metonym]] used to refer to role-playing games in general. The game also achieved minor notoriety, particularly in the 1980s, due to allegations by some [[Christian fundamentalists]] that it promoted [[devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]].

==Play overview==
[[Image:Charsheet.jpg|thumb|175px|A 3.5 Edition character sheet]]

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' is a structured, yet open-ended, &quot;make-believe&quot; game. Each player in the game typically takes on the role of a single character. The game is presented to the players by the [[Dungeon Master]] (or DM). The DM does not have a single character, like the other players, but acts as a narrator, choosing and describing the other characters, settings, and situations the players' characters encounter. During the course of play, each player will choose the actions of their characters and the results of those actions will be determined by the DM using the rules of the game, which govern everything from combat to social interaction.

The rules of the most recent version of the game are detailed in three [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons manuals|core rulebooks]]: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', and the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. Additional rulebooks, such as the ''[[Complete Warrior]]'', contain optional rules which can also be used. Abbreviated versions of the rules are available to help beginners learn the game.

The only items required to play the game are the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons manuals|rulebooks]], a character sheet for each player, and a number of [[dice#non-cubical dice|polyhedral dice]], although there are many optional items which can be used to supplement or enhance the gaming experience, such as pre-designed adventures and [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings]]. Special gameboards or cloth mats are sometimes used to visually depict the situations in the game, and miniature figures can be used to provide a three-dimensional representation of the characters. Computer programs are also available for supporting the game.

[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A set of standard D&amp;D dice: (from left) d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, and two d10s for percentile: ones and tens.]]
Before the game begins, each player creates their own character, recording the details on a character sheet. First, a player will typically roll dice to determine their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#ability scores|ability scores]] (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma).  The player then chooses a [[Race (fantasy)|race]] (such as an [[human]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elf]], or [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarf]]) and a [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character class]] (such as a [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighter]], [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizard]], or [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|rogue]]). The player will then choose skills and feats for their character, describing specific abilities and talents that the character possesses. The player will also select an [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] to describe their character's moral and ethical outlook. These choices determine what the character can do and how well they can perform different actions. As the game is played, the character will grow and change as they gain experience and wealth.

When a player chooses to have his character attempt an action (such as punching an opponent or picking a lock), the outcome will be determined by a character's abilities, the difficulty of the task, a random die roll, or by some combination of the three. Different characters will be skilled at accomplishing different things, and the system encourages a well-balanced team of specialised characters.

When characters defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task they are awarded an appropriate number of [[experience point]]s (or XP) by the DM. Attaining a certain number of experience points causes a character to advance a &quot;level&quot;, gaining more abilities and improving existing ones.

===Adventures and Campaigns===
[[Image:S3ModuleCover.jpg|thumb|175px|''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'' was one of the few adventures released by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] to include [[science-fiction]] elements, such as [[ray gun]]s and [[robot]]s.]]

{{main|Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}
A typical ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game consists of an &quot;adventure&quot;, which is roughly equivalent to a single story. After completing one adventure, players will usually start a new adventure while continuing to play the same characters.

Adventures are usually designed by the Dungeon Master, but throughout the history of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', numerous pre-made &quot;adventures&quot; or &quot;modules&quot; have been published. These modules allow DMs to run a game without needing to create their own adventures, and typically include a backstory, maps, and one or more objectives for players' characters to achieve. Some modules include illustrations or hand-outs to supplement the basic gaming experience. Still, despite the convenience of ready-made adventures, many Dungeon Masters take great pride in creating their own, with extensive backstories and highly original dungeon designs often laid out by hand on graph paper.

A series of adventures played through by a common group of characters is commonly referred to as a &quot;campaign&quot;. As a result, the fantasy settings in which D&amp;D games take place are often known as &quot;campaign settings&quot;. Like the individual adventures themselves, many Dungeon Masters create their own fantasy settings, but there are also many official campaign settings which can be purchased. These worlds range from magic-rich to magic-poor, from traditional western settings to exotic oriental fantasies, from sword and sorcery to swashbuckling adventure.

===Miniature figures===
The wargames from which ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' evolved used [[miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&amp;D'' continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursor, ''Chainmail'', with each figure representing a specific character or monster. While the original rules of ''D&amp;D'' required the use of miniatures to resolve combat situations, the rules quickly evolved to a point where combat could be resolved verbally and miniatures were no longer required for gameplay.

Although no longer essential, miniatures remained popular with players and continued to serve as a useful visual reference, and many gamers took pride in skillful [[figure painting (hobby)|figure painting]]. In the early days of ''D&amp;D'', the miniatures were often placed on [[acetate]]-covered graph paper with walls and other references drawn with grease pencils. As the adventurers moved from one area to another, the grease pencil markings could be wiped off and a new area drawn.

In the 1980s numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and similar games. [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] partnered with [[Grenadier Miniatures]], who released their figures under the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' brand, while other [[Miniature figure#Manufacturers|miniature manufacturers]] (such as [[Ral Partha]] and [[Citadel Miniatures]]) simply release generic, fantasy-themed figures.

Professional products were also released to serve as grid-references for miniature play, from simple rollable mats printed with square or hexagonal grids, suitable for use with [[non-permanent marker]]s, to elaborate systems of interlocking tiles.  Some players would build entire floor-and-wall sets from wood or cardboard and would invest in large inventories of trees and other model objects to create more realistic environments for their miniatures. Professionally-built sets were later released, as well.

Periodically, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming.  Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 &amp; 1989) and a new edition of ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies. The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures Game]]'' (2003) is sold as sets of plastic, randomly assorted, pre-painted miniatures that can be used as either part of a standard ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game or as a stand-alone [[collectible miniatures game]].

==Game History==
[[Image:Chainmail 3rd edition.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The cover to the game ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' predecessor.]]
===Influences===
The fantasy game ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons,'' designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, evolved in the early 1970s from the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' system of [[wargaming]] rules by Gary Gygax and Jeff Perren. The game was influenced by [[mythology]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s.

The presence of [[halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], [[half-elf|half-elves]], [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]] and the like often draw comparisons to the work of [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]], although Gygax maintains that he was influenced very little by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the then-popularity of the work. Other influences, according to the 1977 edition of the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H.P. Lovecraft]], [[Jack Vance]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Roger Zelazny]],  and [[Poul Anderson]].

===Edition history===
{{main|Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons}}
''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.

The original '''''Dungeons and Dragons''''' was published in [[1974]] and was supplemented over the next two years with ''Greyhawk'', ''Blackmoor'', ''Eldritch Wizardry'', and ''Gods, Demi-Gods and Heroes''. Official and popular unofficial rule supplements were also published in the magazines [[The Strategic Review]] and its successor, [[Dragon Magazine]].

[[Image:D&amp;d_Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set]]

In 1977, TSR released two new versions of the game: ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

'''''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' was a simpler, sometimes &quot;introductory&quot;, version of the game. In 1977 the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set'', also referred to as the Second Edition, was published as a boxed set. This edition was revised in 1981, which also coincided with the release of an Expert Set to accompany the Basic Set. Between 1983 and 1985 the Third Edition was released in a series of five boxed sets, including the ''Basic Rules'', ''Expert Rules'', ''Companion Rules'', ''Master Rules'', and ''Immortal Rules''. 

The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game was revised again in 1991. This edition included the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'' (an introductory boxed set) and the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (a hardback manual which included the material from the Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master sets). In 1994 the introductory boxed set was renamed the ''Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game''. In 1999 the introductory box set was revised and released as the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Game''.

'''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (or ''AD&amp;D'') was a more complicated version of the game, designed to collect, revise, and expand on the rules from the original version and its supplements. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the &quot;core rulebooks&quot;, were released: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM).

In 1989, ''AD&amp;D'' was revised for a 2nd Edition (sometimes referred to as ''AD&amp;D2'' or ''2nd Ed''). The game was once again published as three core rulebooks, incorporating the expansions and revisions which had been published in various supplements over the previous decade. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose leaf-binder which was later replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993.

The release of ''AD&amp;D2'' also corresponded with a policy change at TSR. An effort was made to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity. Character classes such as the assassin and monk were eliminated, heroic roleplaying and player teamwork were stressed, demons and devils were renamed tanar'ri and baatezu (respectively), and the product artwork became less racy. The target age of the game was also lowered, with most 2nd edition products being aimed primarily at teenagers.  The Second Edition art and marketing were also modified to appeal more to female players.

In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as &quot;optional core rulebooks&quot;. Although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition, this revision is seen by some fans as a distinct edition of the game and is sometimes referred to as ''AD&amp;D 2.5''.

In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The new company almost immediately began designing a new version of the game, which would be released in 2000 as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition'' (also referred to as ''D&amp;D3'' or ''3E'' and not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&amp;D'' game). The 3rd Edition was the largest revision of the ''D&amp;D'' rules to date. 3rd edition also served as the basis for a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]].

The 3rd Edition rules were more internally consistent and significantly less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players much more flexibility in creating the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage players to further customize their characters. The new rules also standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. 3rd Edition also introduced the concepts of &quot;Prestige Classes&quot; (high-level classes which characters can only enter upon meeting certain character-design prerequisites or fulfilling certain in-game goals) and expanded the idea of high-level campaigns with the ''Epic Level Handbook'' (a supplementary core rulebook).

In 2003, the 3rd Edition rules were revised as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5'' (also known as Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&amp;D3.5''). This release incorporated numerous minor rule changes and expanded the core rulebooks.

A wide variety of optional supplements have been published for every edition of ''D&amp;D''. These supplements commonly include new rules, items, spells, and creatures. Other supplements include new adventures or detail entire fantasy worlds.

The various editions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' have won many Origins Awards, including ''All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977'', ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989'' and ''Best Roleplaying Game of 2000'' for the three flagship editions of the game.

===Influence===
''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was the first modern role-playing game, establishing many of the conventions which have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a resolution mechanic, character record sheets, progressive character development, and game-master-centered group dynamics.

The elements which made up ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' can be seen in many hobbies of the time, though they had existed previously. Character-based roleplaying, for example, can be seen in [[historical reenactment]] and [[improvisational theatre]]. Game world simulations had been well-developed in [[wargaming]]. Fantasy milieus specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games and M.A.R. Barker's [[Tekumel]], among others. Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' represented a unique blending of these elements, creating its own niche and leading to the development of a multitude of role-playing games. [[Science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero]]es, [[cartoon]]s, [[western movie|westerns]], [[espionage|spies and espionage]], and many other fictional settings were adapted to role-playing games.

Over the years, many gamers have criticized various aspects of the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules. In previous editions, clunky and inconsistent mechanics were often seen as inefficient and confusing. Trying to find solutions to these problems led to other game developers to expand on and modify aspects of the game. Within only months of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'''s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games. The first arrivals to achieve lasting influence were [[RuneQuest]], released by [[Chaosium]] in 1976, and the science fiction role-playing game [[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]], released by [[Game Designers Workshop]] in 1978. Some of the later systems include [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' by [[Hero Games]], ''[[GURPS]]'' by [[Steve Jackson Games]] and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]]. These games also fed back into the genre's origin, miniatures wargames, with combat strategy games like ''[[Battletech]]'', ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battles]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''. [[Collectable card games]], like [[Magic: The Gathering]], were also heavily influenced by ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and its legacy.

With the launch of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'''s [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|3rd Edition]], Wizards of the Coast made the [[d20 System]] available under the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL) and [[d20 Trademark License]].  Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing their own games and game supplements. The OGL and d20 Trademark License are also responsible for making possible new versions of older games, such as ''Call of Cthulhu'', using the new system.

===Magazines===
In 1975, TSR began publishing ''The Strategic Review''. At the time, roleplaying games were still seen as a sub-genre of the wargaming industry, and the magazine was designed not only to support ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and TSR's other games, but also to cover wargaming in general. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. The following year, after only seven issues, TSR cancelled ''The Strategic Review'' and replaced it in 1976 with ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' (later ''Dragon Magazine''). Although Dragon Magazine was originally designed to support the roleplaying industry in general, it has always been primarily a house organ for TSR's games with a particular focus on D&amp;D. Most of the magazine's articles provide supplementary material for the game, including new races, classes, spells, traps, monsters, skills, and rules. Other articles will provide tips and suggestions for players and DMs. The magazine has also published a number of well-known, gamer-oriented comic strips over the years, including ''[[Wormy]]'', ''[[SnarfQuest]]'', ''[[Yamara]]'', ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'', ''[[Nodwick]]'', and ''[[Dork Tower]]''.

In 1986, TSR launched a new magazine to complement ''Dragon''. ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon Adventures]]'', published bimonthly, published nothing but [[Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|adventure modules]] for Dungeons Masters. While ''Dungeon'' now publishes other kinds of material as well, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' adventures remain its main focus.

Although many other magazines have partially or fully devoted themselves to supporting ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', ''Dragon'' and ''Dungeon'' remain the only two official publications for the game. In 2002, Wizards of the Coast licensed the two magazines to [[Paizo Publishing]].

===Films and TV===
A popular ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (TV series)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[animated television series]] was produced in [[1983]].  The cartoon was based upon the concept of a small group of young adults and children who get transported to a D&amp;D-based fantasy realm by riding a magical roller coaster.  When they arrive, they are given potent magical weapons and must survive against the chromatic dragon [[Tiamat (fiction)|Tiamat]] and a power-hungry nemesis called [[Venger]].  They are assisted, episode by episode, by a gnome-like ally Dungeon Master and a baby unicorn named &quot;Uni&quot;.

A ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie]]'' was released in 2000. ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2: Wrath of the Dragon God]]'', a made-for-TV sequel, was first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel on October 8th, 2005, and is scheduled for release in February 2006 on DVD. (This sequel is also known by the alternate title ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2: The Elemental Might''.)

In 2003, a computer animated motion picture entitled ''[[Scourge of Worlds: A Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure]]'' was produced for [[DVD]], featuring the iconic characters (Regdar, Mialee, and Lidda) created for the 3rd Edition. This is an interactive movie that asks viewers to decide what actions the heroes should take at crucial points in the story, allowing hundreds of different story-telling combinations. A special edition was released later that included even more choices, two additional endings, the making of the Scourge of Worlds, and the original (linear) version of film.

===Computer and video games===
Fifty-three computer games and sixteen video games (ten for consoles, four for handheld devices, and two arcade games) had been released and sold under the ''D&amp;D'' license [[as of 2004|as of October 2004]]. Almost half of these games were developed by [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI). Most, but not all, are [[computer role-playing games]] that use rules derived from some version of the ''D&amp;D'' rules. Notable titles include

* ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Cartridge'', designed for the [[Intellivision]], was the first computer console game based on the ''D&amp;D'' license.
* ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' ([[1988]]) was the first ''D&amp;D'' computer game. Designed by SSI, the same game engine would be used to develop ten more ''D&amp;D'' games. It was followed by a sequel ''[[Pool of Radiance#Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor|Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor]]'', released in [[2001]] from [[Ubisoft]]
* ''[[Eye of the Beholder (computer game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' ([[1990]]) was the first in a trilogy of popular games designed by [[Westwood Studios]] and published by SSI in the early [[1990s]].
* ''[[Neverwinter Nights#History|Neverwinter Nights]]'', ([[1991]]-[[1997]]) was developed by [[Stormfront Studios]] and was the first graphical [[MMORPG]], paving the way for derivative games including ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Everquest]]''.  The game was a major hit, and the name and settings formed the basis for the ''Neverwinter Nights'' PC game (see below).
* ''[[Baldur's Gate series|Baldur's Gate]]'' ([[1998]]) was the first ''D&amp;D'' computer game developed using [[Bioware]]'s Infinity Engine to be published by [[Interplay]]. It met with critical success and was followed by several more ''D&amp;D'' games, including a sequel (''[[Baldur's Gate series#Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn |Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn]]''), similarly developed by Bioware with ''[[Icewind Dale series|Icewind Dale]]'', ''[[Icewind Dale II]]'' and ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' developed by Interplay's [[Black Isle Studios]].
* ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' ([[2002]]), also developed by BioWare, was the first faithful implementation of the 3rd Edition rules in a [[CRPG]]. The game included sophisticated design tools which allowed Dungeon Masters to design unique scenarios, or modules, much as they would for the tabletop game itself.  Over 3000 of these user-created modules have been released onto the internet.
* ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil (computer game)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'' ([[2003]]), developed by [[Troika Games]], was based on the 1985 [[Temple of Elemental Evil|module]] of the same name. The game used the ''v 3.5'' rules and implemented a true turn-based combat system that reproduced the core book rules more precisely than any other previous ''D&amp;D'' [[CRPG]]. However, the game was plagued by incomplete/broken content and numerous bugs, making it an unpopular title.
* ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online]]'' is an [[MMORPG]] based on the [[Eberron]] campaign setting. It is currently being developed by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]]. The game is currently on the 'Head Start Event', and is scheduled for a February 28th 2006 release.

For a full list of licensed ''D&amp;D'' computer and video games, see [[List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons computer and video games]]. Many other CRPGs, including the numerous [[Roguelike]] games, [[MUD]]'s (Multi-User Dungeons) and [[MMORPG]]'s (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) are based on the D&amp;D game. One popular example was the [[Wizardry]] series that was first released on the [[Apple II]] in the [[1980s]] and eventually became available on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[IBM PC]] under [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]

===Novels===
Several hundred [[novel]]s have been published based upon ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

* Fantasy Grand Master [[Andre Norton]]'s novel ''Quag Keep'', published in 1978, was set in [[Greyhawk]], making it the first novel to use a ''D&amp;D'' campaign setting.
* Throughout the early 1980s, TSR printed several series of &quot;[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]&quot;-style novels under the [[Endless Quest]], [[Super Endless Quest]], [[Heart Quest Books]], and [[1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks]] trademarks. Most of these books were based on ''D&amp;D'', although some were based on other TSR role-playing games.
* The [[Dragonlance|Dragonlance Chronicles]] trilogy by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]], published in 1984, were the first major novels published by TSR.
* ''D&amp;D'' creator Gary Gygax's series of [[Gord the Rogue]] novels, published from 1985 to 1988, was set in his Greyhawk campaign setting.
* Author [[R. A. Salvatore]] wrote a number of books based in the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting, including 17 that feature his famed character [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].
* From 2002 to 2004, a series of interlinking novels focusing upon the iconic characters of the 3rd Edition were published. These books were written by a variety of WotC authors under the pseudonym [[T.H. Lain]].

===Comics===
During the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], [[DC Comics]] published several licensed ''D&amp;D'' comics, including ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (comic)|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[Forgotten Realms (comic)|Forgotten Realms]]'', and ''[[Spelljammer (comic)|Spelljammer]]''.

After the release of the 3rd Edition, [[Kenzer &amp; Company|KenzerCo]], better known for the popular gaming comic ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'', secured the licensing rights to produce official ''D&amp;D'' comics. Using the license, they produced a number of different mini-series.  One notable mini-series for this comic line entitled ''Tempest's Gate'' was authored by Sean Smith. It featured memorable iconic characters of D&amp;D such as ''Zed Kraken'', a powerful and influential magus.[http://www.kenzerco.com/periodicals/dnd/tg.php]

In 2002, Iron Hammer Graphics published the single-issue comic ''Vecna:  Hand of the Revenent''.  In 2005, the license passed to [[Devil's Due Productions]]. Starting in June of that year, Devil's Due began releasing official adaptations of ''D&amp;D'' tie-in novels, starting with Salvatore's ''Dark Elf Trilogy''.

===Board games===
Several [[board games]] have been sold either under the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' trademark or in association with it:

* [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Computer Labyrinth Game]]  (1980) This was the first computer/board game hybrid and the first ''D&amp;D'' licensed game that contained digital electronics.  
* [[DragonStrike (board game)|DragonStrike]] (1993) used a simplified form of ''D&amp;D'' and included an instructional [[video tape]] in which costumed actors, combined with [[computer-generated imagery]], played the characters and monsters from the board game.
* [[Dungeon]] (1975), a board game published by TSR, featured similar gameplay and genre tropes to ''D&amp;D'' and was frequently advertised in ''D&amp;D'' products.
* [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fantasy Adventure Boardgame]] (2002) Cooperative dungeon crawl game in which a party of four heroes strives to complete adventures that the Dungeon Master puts before them (In the Style of [[HeroQuest]]). Two expansions have been released for this game:
** Eternal Winter (2004)
** Forbidden Forest (2005)
* Dungeons and Dragons Clue (2001) Standard [[Cluedo|Clue]] with a D&amp;D fantasy theme and optional wandering monsters.
* [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game]] (2004) A simplified version of the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game, designed as an introduction to roleplaying, but is in essence a boardgame in the style of presentation.
* Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Game (2000) Based upon the roleplaying system D&amp;D here we have an typical dungeon crawl game.
* Introduction to Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1995) An introductory board version of the AD&amp;D system via basic scenarios played with miniatures (plastic, included), and a campy/nifty CD for both ambiance and automated DM instructions.
* The New Easy to Master Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1991) This game is in a way an introduction to RPG but is played as a board game. Three expansions were released for it: Dragon's Den, Haunted Tower, Goblin's Lair.

As the popularity of ''D&amp;D'' grew throughout the late-'70s and '80s, references to the game often began to appear in popular culture. For example, in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'', several of the young characters are shown playing the game. 

More typically, ''D&amp;D'' players are seen as the epitome of [[geek]]dom, and references to the game are used as a shorthand to establish characterization (as in the movie ''[[Airheads]]'') or provide the punchline of a joke (for example, on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''). Many players, miffed with this stereotype, embrace the fact that film stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Stephen Colbert]] have confessed to playing ''D&amp;D''. 

The TV Series [[Futurama]] also contained numerous references to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, including an animated appearance by Gary Gygax himself.

It should also be noted that ''D&amp;D'' is frequently parodied, with parodies of the game existing in nearly all media, including [http://www.deadgentlemen.com/ film], [http://snltranscripts.jt.org/89/89jlothar.phtml television], and [[Order of the Stick|cartoons]], among others.  Much of the potential for parody in ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' may exist because, with its heroic millieu and imagination-based gameplay, it exaggerates the gap between the actuality of the players' self-image and the grandiose personas they adopt in gameplay [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/si.2004.27.3.333] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]).

==Controversy and notoriety==
[[Image:Jack_chick_dark_dungeons.JPG|thumb|380px|right|In ''[[Chick Publications|Dark Dungeons]]'' by [[Jack Chick]], a girl gets involved in [[witchcraft]] through playing D&amp;D. Later she converts to [[Christianity]] and rejects the game. In these frames D&amp;D materials are [[book burning|burnt]] at a Christian gathering.  The man is shown attempting to banish the evil game by invoking the power of a deity through a ritual of words and hand gestures.  Ironically, this is not much different than a D&amp;D player character casting a clerical spell.]]

The game's commercial success led to lawsuits between Arneson and Gygax starting in 1979, over issues of royalties, particularly for ''AD&amp;D'' for which Arneson was not given credit by TSR.  Those suits were settled out of court by 1981.

The game also achieved notoriety, particularly in the 1980s, due to its alleged promotion of [[devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]]. Some [[Evangelical Christians]] have criticized Dungeons &amp; Dragons for encouraging interest in sorcery and demonic creatures. Many of these criticisms, though mentioning &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; by name, were actually aimed at [[Role-playing game|RPG's]] or the [[fantasy]] genre in general and are covered in the [[History of role-playing games#Controversy|History of role-playing games article.]]

The controversy involving occult influences led TSR to remove lengthy references to [[demon]]s, [[devil]]s, and other supernatural monsters commonly associated with &quot;sorcery&quot; in the 2nd Edition of ''AD&amp;D''. Many of these aspects were returned to the game with the release of the 3rd Edition. A few products have gone into even further detail on the activities of demons and demon worshippers than those of previous editions; the more extreme, like the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]],'' bear a &quot;For Mature Audiences Only&quot; label.

Though religious groups have alleged promotion of satanic and evil ideas, the original '''AD&amp;D''' rules actually provided for an equal balance of power between the capabilities of good and evil forces.  This equipotential view of good and evil, itself controversial to some groups, continues to be found in newer editions of the game; for example, the ''[[Book of Exalted Deeds]]'' also bears a &quot;For Mature Audiences Only&quot; label.

[[Judges Guild]] actually had a license to create '''AD&amp;D'''-compatible items. When said license was then pulled by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], [[Judges Guild]] was ruined. [[Grimoire Games]], which published [[David A. Hargrave]]'s multi-volume [[Arduin]] series, had no such license, and when legally challenged by TSR to [[cease and desist]], relied on white-out and typing correction tape to mask its use of '''AD&amp;D''' references in subsequent printings of the [[Arduin]] series.

The game ran afoul of copyright issues with respect to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and [[Elric of Melniboné|Melnibonéan Mythos]] in early versions of the ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' manual.  These problems were ultimately resolved by excising the material from later editions of the manual.

{{CrimPro}}
'''Double jeopardy''' (also called &quot;[[autrefois acquit]]&quot; meaning &quot;already acquitted&quot;) is a [[procedural defense]] (and, in many countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[India]], a [[constitution]]al right) that forbids a [[defendant]] from being [[trial (law)|tried]] a second time for a crime, after having already been tried for the same crime. At common law a defendant can plead ''autrefois acquit'' or ''autrefois convict''; meaning the defendant has been acquitted or convicted of the same offence previously.

==Double jeopardy by country==
===Australia===
Australian double jeopardy jurisprudence is very similar to other common law countries. While there is no constitutional protection against re-trials following acquittal, there have been few examples of statutory exceptions. 

In all state jurisdictions prosecutors can appeal against the sentence handed down by the trial judge and in South Australia and Tasmania the prosecution can appeal against an error of law made by the trial judge in certain situations. However the aquittal will still stand valid and the purpose of the appeal is merely to clarify the relevant law for future cases.

In contrast to other common law jurisdictions, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to extend to prevent prosecution for perjury following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the previous acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of ''[[The Queen v Carroll]]'', where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Caroll's sworn alibi two decades after he had been acquitted of the murder of a young girl and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturning of his conviction by the High Court has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the UK legislation.

===Canada===
{{sectstub}}
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] includes provisions such as [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(h)]] prohibiting double jeopardy.  But often this prohibition only applies after the trial is finally concluded - in contrast to the laws of the United States, [[Canada|Canadian]] law allows the prosecution to appeal from an acquittal.  If the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy because the first trial and its judgement would have been annulled.  In rare circumstances, a court of appeal might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal.  This is not considered to be double jeopardy either - in this case the appeal and subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.

===Europe===
All members of the [[Council of Europe]] (which includes nearly all European countries, and all members of the [[European Union]]) have signed the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], which protects against double jeopardy. The Seventh Protocol, Article Four, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an [[offence]] for which he has already been finally [[acquittal|acquitted]] or [[conviction (law)|convicted]] in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This specific optional protocol has been ratified by all EU states except six (namely [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]]). Those members states may still have the provision in their respective constitutions (if any) providing a prohibition against double jeopardy.

In many European countries the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court (similar to the provisions of Canadian law) - this is not counted as double jeopardy but as a continuation of the same trial.  This is allowed by the European Convention of Human Rights - note the word ''finally'' in the above quote.

====France====
Once all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgment is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was [[forgery|forged]]. Prosecution for an already judged crime is impossible even though new incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on grounds of new exculpating evidence.

====United Kingdom====
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed legislation in the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] introduced by then [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] to abolish the previously strict form of prohibition of double jeopardy.  Retrials are now allowed if there is 'new and compelling evidence'. All cases must be approved by the [[Director Of Public Prosecutions]] and the [[Court Of Appeal]] must agree to quash the original acquittal.[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section19/chapter_j.html]

===India===
{{sectstub}}
In India, protection against double jeopardy is a [[Fundamental Rights of India|Fundamental Right]] under [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India#Right to Freedom|Right to Freedom]].It is a fundamental right guaranteed under .The provision enshrines the principle that a person cannot be tried twice for same offence by the equally competent court.Thus aperson cannot be tried for the offence of which he had been tried and acquitted or convicted.

===United States===
The phrase &quot;double jeopardy&quot; stems from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]: &quot;nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.&quot;  This clause is intended to limit prosecutorial abuse by the [[government]] in repeated [[prosecution]] for the same offense, as a means of harassment or oppression.  It is also in harmony with the [[common law]] concept of ''[[res judicata]],'' which prevents courts from relitigating issues and claims that have already been the subject of a final judgment.

There are three essential protections included in double jeopardy:  protection from being retried for the same crime after an acquittal; protection from retrial after a conviction; and protection from being punished multiple times for the same offense.

This law is occasionally referred to as a [[legal technicality]], because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed.  For example, were police to uncover new evidence conclusively proving the guilt of someone previously acquitted, there is little they can do because the defendant may not be tried again (at least, not on the same or substantially similar charge) ''[[Fong Foo v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|369 U.S. 141 ]] (1962).

Though the Fifth Amendment applies only to the federal government, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has ruled that the double jeopardy clause applies to the [[U.S. state|states]] as well, through [[due process#Incorporation|incorporation]] by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

Jeopardy attaches in a [[jury trial]] once the jury and alternates are impanelled and sworn in. In a [[non-jury trial]], jeopardy attaches once the first evidence is put on, which occurs when the first [[witness]] is sworn.

Some solace can be found in the fact that in many cases, Civil Trials, where the burden of proof is substantially lower, have resulted in some criminally not-guilty defendants have been found liable for wrongful death.  

====Exceptions to double jeopardy====
As double jeopardy only applies to charges that were the subject of an earlier ''final'' judgment, there are many situations in which it does not apply despite the appearance of a retrial.  For example, a second trial held after a [[mistrial]] does not violate the double jeopardy clause, because a mistrial ends a trial prematurely without a judgment of guilty or not guilty.  [[Legal case|Cases]] which have been [[case dismissal|dismissed]] because of insufficient evidence may constitute a final judgment for these purposes, though many state and federal laws allow for limited prosecutorial appeals from these orders.  A re-trial after a conviction has been reversed on appeal also does not violate double jeopardy, because the judgment in the first trial has been invalidated.  In both of these cases, however, the previous trials do not entirely vanish.  Testimony from them may be used in later retrials, such as to impeach contradictory testimony given at any subsequent proceeding.

There are two exceptions to the general rule that the prosecution cannot appeal from an acquittal.  If the earlier trial is proven to be a fraud or sham, double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial. In ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=7th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=972479 Harry Aleman v. Judges of the Criminal Division, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, et al.]'', [[Case citation|183 F.3d 302]] ([[1998]]), an appeals court ruled that a man who bribed his trial [[judge]] and was acquitted of murder was allowed to be tried again, because his bribe prevented his first trial from actually putting him in jeopardy.  The other exception is that prosecutors may appeal when a trial judge sets aside a jury verdict for conviction with a ''judgment notwithstanding the verdict'' for the defendant.  A successful appeal by the prosecution would simply reinstate the jury verdict, and so would not place the defendant at risk of another trial.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has also upheld laws allowing the government to appeal criminal sentences in limited circumstances (such as 18 U.S.C. 3742(b)).  The Court ruled that sentences were not accorded the same constitutional finality as jury verdicts under the double jeopardy clause, and giving this right of appeal also did not put the defendant at risk of a succession of prosecutions.

Double jeopardy is also not implicated for separate offenses or in separate jurisdictions arising from the same act.  For example, in ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=503&amp;invol=378 United States v. Felix]'' ([[1992]]), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled: &quot;a[n]...[[crime|offense]] and a [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit that offense are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.&quot;  

As another example, a state might try a defendant for [[murder]], after which the federal government might try the same defendant for a federal crime (perhaps a [[civil rights]] violation or [[kidnapping]]) related to the same act. For example, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers who beat up black motorist [[Rodney King]] in [[1991]] were acquitted by a [[county]] court of the accusation of [[assault]]; some were later convicted and sentenced in federal court for violating his civil rights.  Similar techniques were used for prosecuting racially-motivated crimes in the [[U.S._Southern_States|Southern United States]] in the [[1960s]] during the time of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], when those crimes had not been actively prosecuted, or had resulted in acquittals by juries thought to be racist or sympathetic to the accused, in local courts. 

The &quot;separate sovereigns&quot; exception to double jeopardy arises from the unique nature of the American federal system, in which states are considered to be sovereigns with plenary power that have relinquished a number of enumerated powers to the federal government.  Double jeopardy attaches only to prosecutions for the same criminal act by the same sovereign, but as separate sovereigns, both the federal and state governments can bring separate prosecutions for the same act.  For example, [[Timothy McVeigh]] was executed by the federal government for murdering eight federal [[employee]]s with a [[bomb]], but could also have been tried in state court for murdering numerous other persons in the same explosion.

Double jeopardy also does not attach if the later charge is civil rather than criminal in nature, which involves a different legal standard.  Acquittal in a criminal case does not prevent the defendant from being the defendant in a civil suit relating to the same incident (though ''[[res judicata]]'' operates within the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system.)  For example, [[O.J. Simpson]] was acquitted of double homicide in a [[California]] criminal prosecution, but lost a wrongful death civil claim brought over the same victims.  If the defendant happened to be on [[parole]] from an earlier offense at the time, the act for which he was acquitted may also be the subject of a parole violation hearing, which is not considered a criminal trial and is also subject to a lower standard of proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Disbarment''' is a penalty for [[lawyer]]s.  It consists of no longer being allowed to practice [[law]] or argue [[case]]s. For most lawyers, this can essentially mean no longer having a livelihood.  

Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, such as being convicted of a [[felony]], willfully disregarding the interests of a client, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice.  

In the [[United States]] legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the bar in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare.  Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, fines, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dance music''' is [[music]] composed, played, or both, specifically to accompany social [[dance|dancing]]. It can be either the whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement.

Dance music includes a huge variety of music, including traditional dance music such as [[Irish traditional music]], [[waltz]]es, [[rock and roll]], [[country music]] and [[Tango music|tango]]s. An example of traditional dance music in the United States is the [[old-time music]] played at [[square dance]]s and [[contra dance]]s.

In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances, which were often derived from folk dances.  Examples include the [[allemande]], [[courante]], [[sarabande]], and [[gigue]].

In the [[Classical music era]], the [[minuet]] gained dominance, usually as a third [[movement (music)|movement]] in four-movement non-vocal works such as [[sonata (music)|sonatas]], [[string quartet]]s, and [[symphony|symphonies]].  The [[waltz]] also arose later in the Classical era, as the minuet evolved into the [[scherzo]] (literally, &quot;joke&quot;; a faster-paced minuet).  Both remained part of the [[Romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]], and [[polonaise]].

The [[20th century]] saw the rise of more dance forms, often [[jazz]]-based or -related, such as the [[ragtime]].  As 20th century classical music headed toward more dissonant and non-traditional directions with [[tonality]], popular genres began to take up the need for dance music, and produced numerous duple and quadruple dance forms.

From the late [[1970s]], the term ''dance music'' has come to also refer (in the context of [[nightclub]]s) more specifically to [[electronic music]] offshoots of [[rock and roll]], such as [[disco]], [[house music|house]], [[techno music|techno]] and [[trance music|trance]].  Generally, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or general popular song is that in dance music the bass hits &quot;[[four to the floor]]&quot; at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), while in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four (Michaels, 1990).

==Genres==

Dance music works usually bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. [[waltz|waltzes]], the [[Tango music|tango]], the [[bolero]], the [[can-can]], [[minuet|minuets]], [[salsa (music)|salsa]], various kinds of [[jig|jigs]] and the [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Other dance forms include [[contradance]], the [[merengue (music)|merengue]], the [[cha-cha-cha]]. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance. See [[:category:Musical genres]] for more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dog tags.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog tags of a U.S. Army soldier during World War II]]
:''For the tag worn by dogs, see [[dog tag]].''

A '''dog tag''' is the colloquial name for the identification tags worn by military personnel,  because of their resemblance to actual [[dog tag]]s.  In the US the name, military ID number, blood type, and religion are stamped on a small piece of [[metal]] that is worn on a metal chain around the neck. During World War II, certain medical information such as the date of the soldier's last tetanus shot was also included on the tag.  The tag is primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded.  In the event the member has a medical condition that requires special attention, an additional red tag with the pertinent information is issued and worn with the dog tags.

Wearing of the tag is required at all times by soldiers in the field. It may contain two copies of the information and be designed to break easily into two pieces. This allows half the tag to be collected for notification while the other half remains with the body when battle conditions do not allow the casualty to be immediately recovered. Alternately, a two identical tags are issued. One is worn on a long chain around the neck; the second on a much smaller chain attached to the first chain. In the event the wearer is killed the second tag is collected and the first remains with the body.

==Dog tags in history==
Dog tags were worn at least as far back as ancient [[Sparta]].

During the [[American Civil War]] of [[1861]]-[[1865]], some soldiers pinned paper notes with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stencilled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of the Army belt buckle. 

Manufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of [[brass]] or [[lead]] with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield and such phrases as &quot;War for the Union&quot; or &quot;Liberty, Union, and Equality.&quot;  The other side had the soldier's name and unit and sometimes a list of [[battle]]s in which he had participated.

A [[New York]]er named John Kennedy wrote to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in [[1862]], offering to furnish discs for all officers and men in the Federal Army, enclosing a design for the disc. The National Archives now has the letter along with the reply, a summary refusal without explanation.

In the [[Spanish-American War]], [[soldier]]s purchased crude stamped identification tags; sometimes with misleading information.

The [[Prussia|Prussian]] Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870.

The U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated [[December 20]], [[1906]], which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:

:&quot;An aluminum identification tag, the size of a silver half dollar and of suitable thickness, stamped with the name, [[military rank|rank]], [[company (military unit)|company]], [[regiment]], or [[corps]] of the wearer, will be worn by each officer and enlisted man of the Army whenever the field kit is worn, the tag to be suspended from the neck, underneath the clothing, by a cord or thong passed through a small hole in the tab. It is prescribed as a part of the uniform and when not worn as directed herein will be habitually kept in the possession of the owner. The tag will be issued by the Quartermaster's Department gratuitously to enlisted men and at cost price to officers...&quot;

The Army changed regulations on [[July 6]], [[1916]], so that all men were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In [[1918]], the Army adopted and allotted the serial number system, and name and serial numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags of all enlisted men. (Serial number 1 was assigned to enlisted man Arthur B. Crean of Chicago in the course of his fifth enlistment period.) In [[1969]] the Army converted to the [[Social Security number]] for personnel identification.

There is a recurring myth about WWII dog tags. There was a notch cut into the side of the tag which held the tab in place on the embossing machine. It has been rumored that the notch's purpose was so that if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take on tag to the commanding officer and kick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identifed.  According to Snopes, the notch is there simply to hold the tag in place on the embossing machine.

In the [[1950s]], at the height of fears about possible [[nuclear war]], all [[New York City]] public school pupils were issued dog tags.

In more modern battles, like the [[Vietnam War]], American soldiers were required to place rubber silencers on their dog tags so the enemy would not hear the metallic clanking. 

Dog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers and marines create to their fallen comrades. The casualty's rifle with [[bayonet]] affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the stock of the rifle. The dog tags are then hung from the handle or trigger guard of the rifle.

Recently, the army stopped calling the tags &quot;Dog tags&quot; and adopted the more civilized &quot;I.D tags&quot;.  It was rumored that, in the 1990s, some enlisted trainees complained that the term &quot;dog tag&quot; was offensive, but this has not been confirmed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''definition of philosophy''' is famously a difficult matter, and indeed many definitions of [[philosophy]] begin by stating that it is famously difficult.  Nonetheless, a review of [[Definition_of_philosophy#References|standard reference works]] suggests that there is a broad agreement among the philosophers who write these reference works, as to what the definition actually is.  
This article lists the main points of agreement.

#Philosophy is difficult to define.  The ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' ({{fn|OCP}}) says that most interesting definitions of philosophy are controversial. ''Philosophy: The Basics'' ({{fn|PTB}}) says it is &quot;notoriously difficult&quot;.  ''Mastering Philosophy'' {{fn|MP}} says there is &quot;no straightforward definition&quot;.
#''Method'': The ''Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'' ({{fn|PDP}}) says the method of philosophy is rational enquiry, or enquiry guided by the canons of rationality. OCP says it is explicitly rationally critical thinking 'of a more or less systematic kind'. The ''Collins English Dictionary'' ({{fn|CED}}) mentions the use of 'rational argument'. ''Modern Thomistic Philosophy'' ({{fn|MTP}}) says 'natural light of reason'. PTB says that the most distinctive feature of philosophy is its use of logical argument.  There is some agreement, therefore, that the philosophical method is rational, systematic and critical, or characterised by logical argument.
#''Intrinsic Character'':
#*Philosophy is distinct from [[Empiricism|empirical science]] and [[Religion|religion]]. The ''Penguin Encyclopedia'' ({{fn|PE}}) says that philosophy differs from science in that its questions cannot be answered empirically, ''i.e.'' by observation or experiment, and from religion, in that its purpose is entirely intellectual, and allows no place for faith or [[Revelation|revelation]].  MTP says philosophy does not try to answer questions by appeal to revelation, myth or religious knowledge of any kind, but uses reason, &quot;without reference to sensible observation and experiments&quot;.
#*'Second-order' nature: PDP says it is a &quot;common view&quot; that philosophy enquiry is second order, having concepts, theories and presupposition as its subject matter.  OCP says it is &quot;thinking about thinking&quot;, and that philosophy has a &quot;generally second-order character&quot;, being reflective thought about particular kinds of thinking.  ODP says that in philosophy we study rather than use the concepts that structure our thinking, and that this is second-order reflection.  TYP also uses the expression 'second-order'.
#*Misleading etymology:  Only PE gives &quot;Love of wisdom&quot; as a possible meaning.  PTB says the etymology is &quot;not much help&quot;.  Other works mention the ''etymology'' without saying that it is the ''meaning''.
#*Critical nature:  OCP says philosophy is critical thinking.  PTB says that philosophy examines the beliefs we take for granted.  ERHP says &quot;in English-speaking philosophy (and much European philosophy too) you are taught not to take anything on trust, particularly if it seems obvious and undeniable&quot;.
#*What it is not: PTB says philosophy is NOT mysticism or about outlook on life.
#''Subject matter'':  PDP says the subject matter of philosophy is &quot;the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action and reality&quot;.  PE says &quot;the most general questions about our universe and our place in it&quot;.  MTP: The &quot;absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates&quot; or &quot;the fundamental reasons or causes of all things&quot;.  CED lists the branches of p (see below).  ODP says it is the investigation of the most general and abstract features of the world and the categories with which we think, in order to &quot;lay bare their foundations and presuppositions&quot;.  MP says it is the study of ultimate reality.  TYP says that philosophy is about 'the big questions'.
#''Branches'':  These are metaphysics (PE, OCP, MTP, CED, IP) epistemology (CED, MTP, OCP, IP), ethics (OCP, MTP, IP, CED), logic or semantics (PE, CED), cosmology (MTP), theory of mind (MTP), political philosophy (IP), aesthetics (IP). Hence there is a broad agreement that metaphysics, epistemology and ethics and possibly logic are the main branches of philosophy.
#''Goals'':  PDP says the goals of philosophy are &quot;the disinterested pursuit of knowledge for its own sake&quot;.  MTP says &quot;to discover the absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates&quot;.  CED says &quot;making explicit the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs&quot;.  MP says the purpose of philosophy is to unify and transcend the insights given by science and religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|For other senses of this word, see [[data (disambiguation)]].}}
'''Data''' is the [[plural]] of ''datum''. 
A '''datum''' is a ''[[statement]] accepted at [[face value]]'' (a &quot;given&quot;).
A large class of practically important statements are [[measurement]]s or [[observation]]s of a [[variable]].
Such statements may comprise numbers, words, or images.

==Etymology==
The word ''data'' is the plural of [[Latin]] ''datum'', neuter past participle of ''dare'', &quot;to give&quot;, hence &quot;something given&quot;. The [[past participle]] of &quot;to give&quot; has been used for millennia, in the sense of a statement accepted at face value; one of the works of [[Euclid]], circa 300 BC, was the ''Dedomena'' (in Latin, ''Data''). In discussions of problems in [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and so on, the terms ''givens'' and ''data'' are used interchangeably. Such usage is the origin of ''data'' as a concept in [[computer science]]: ''data'' are numbers, words, images, etc., accepted as they stand.

==Usage in English==
In [[English language| English]], the word ''datum'' is still used in the general sense of &quot;something given&quot;, and more specifically in [[cartography]], [[geography]], [[geology]], and [[technical drawing|drafting]] to mean a reference point, reference line, or reference surface. The Latin plural ''data'' is also used as a plural in English, but it is also commonly treated as a [[mass noun]] and used in the [[singular]]. For example, &quot;This is all the data from the experiment&quot;.  This usage is inconsistent with the rules of Latin grammar, which would suggest, &quot;These are the data ...&quot;; each measurement or result is a single ''datum''. However, given the variety and irregularity of [[English plural]] constructions, there seem to be no grounds for arguing that ''data'' is incorrect as a singular mass noun in English.

==Uses of ''data'' in computing==
{{main|Data (computing)}}

''Raw data'' are [[number]]s, [[character (computing)|characters]], [[image]]s or other outputs from devices to convert physical quantities into symbols, in a very broad sense. Such data are typically further [[process|processed]] by a human or [[input]] into a [[computer]], [[Computer storage|stored]] and processed there, or transmitted ([[output]]) to another human or computer. ''Raw data'' is a relative term; data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the &quot;processed data&quot; from one stage may be considered the &quot;raw data&quot; of the next.

Mechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data. An [[analog computer]] represents a datum as a voltage, distance, position, or other physical quantity. A [[digital computer]] represents a datum as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed [[alphabet]]. The most common digital computers use a binary alphabet, that is, an alphabet of two characters, typically denoted &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. More familiar representations, such as numbers or letters, are then constructed from the binary alphabet.

Some special forms of data are distinguished. A [[computer program]] is a collection of data, which can be interpreted as instructions. Most computer languages make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs operate, but in some languages, notably [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] and similar languages, programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data. It is also useful to distinguish [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]], that is, a description of other data. A similar, earlier term for metadata is &quot;ancillary data.&quot;  The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog, which is a description of the contents of books.

==Meaning of data, information and knowledge==
The terms [[information]] and [[knowledge]] are frequently used for overlapping concepts. These three concepts are ill or ambiguously defined in the subject matter literature &lt;!--Anyone know what subject matter this is referring to?  It may need clarifying. User:Joeblakesley--&gt;. However, In recent interdisciplinary research a few independent specializations of these terms have been proposed.

See [[Information#Information is not data | Information: Information is not data]] for the commonly made distinction between ''information'' and ''data''.

A '''drum''' is a [[musical instrument]] in the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] family , technically classified as a [[membranophone]]. Drums consist of at least one [[membrane]], called a ''[[drumhead]]'' or ''drumskin'',  that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with parts of a player's body, or with some sort of implement such as a [[drumstick]], to produce [[sound]]. Drums are among the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has been virtually unchanged for hundreds of years.

The shell almost invariably has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a [[cylinder]], although [[timpani]] for example use [[bowl]]-shaped shells. Other shapes include truncated cones ([[bongo drums]]) and joined truncated cones ([[talking drum]]).

Drums with cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as in the [[timbales]]) or, more commonly in the Western tradition, they can have another drum head. Sometimes they have a solid shell with no holes in at all though this is rare. It is usual for a drum to have some sort of hole in to let air move through the drum when it is struck. This gives a louder and longer ring to the notes of the drum, so drums with two heads covering both ends of a tubular shell often have a small hole halfway between the 2 drumheads. The membrane is struck, either with the hand or with a [[drumstick]], and the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound.  The [[sound of a drum]] depends on several variables including shell shape, size, thickness of shell, materials of the shell, type of drumhead, tension of the drumhead, position of the drum, location, and how it is struck.

In lots of [[popular music]] and [[jazz]], ''drums''  usually refers to a [[drum kit]] or set of drums, and ''[[drummer]]'' to the band member or person who plays them. Drums are also played by percussionists whose skills can be called for in all areas of music from Classical to Heavy Rock &amp; all areas in between.

In the past, drums were used as a means of [[communic
