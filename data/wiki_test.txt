[[Image:Delphi amphitheater from above dsc06297.jpg|250px|thumb|The theatre, seen from above]]

'''Delphi''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Δελφοί — ''Delphoi''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]) is an archaeological site and a modern town in [[Greece]]. In ancient times it was the site of the [[Delphic Sibyl]], dedicated to the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. Delphi was revered throughout the Greek world as the site of the ''ομφαλός ([[omphalos]])'' stone, the centre of the universe. In the inner ''εστία  ([[hestia]])'', or hearth, of the Temple of [[Apollo|Delphic Apollo]] (''Απόλλων Δελφίνιος — Apollon Delphinios''), an άσβεστος φλόγα ([[eternal flame]]) burned. After the [[battle of Plataea]], the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the foundation stories of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi (Burkert, 1985, pp. 61, 84).

==Location==

Delphi is located in a plateau on the side of [[Parnassus|Mt. Parnassus]]. This semicircular spur is known as [[Phaedriades]]; it overlooks the [[Pleistos Valley]].  Southwest of Delphi, about 15 km away, is the harbor-city of [[Kirrha]] on the [[Corinthian Gulf]].

==[[Apollo]]==

[[Image:Temple of Apollo at Delphi from below with ivy.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Temple of Apollo, seen from below]]

[[Image:Ancient athletics stadium at Delphi.JPG|250px|thumb|View of the stadium of the Delphi sanctuary, used for the [[Pythian Games]]. The stone steps on the right were added under the Romans.]]

The name ''Delphoi'' is connected with δελφός ''delphus'' &quot;womb&quot; and may indicate archaic veneration of an [[Earth Goddess]] at the site. Apollo is connected with the site by his [[epithet]] Δελφίνιος ''Delphinios'', &quot;the Delphinian&quot;, i.e. either &quot;the one of Delphi&quot;, or &quot;the one of the womb&quot;. The epithet is connected with [[dolphins]] (the &quot;womb-fish&quot;) in the [[Homeric hymns|Homeric ''Hymn to Apollo'']] Εις Απόλλωνα Πύθιον, 400), telling how Apollo first came to Delphi in the shape of a dolphin, carrying [[Crete|Cretan]] priests on his back.

Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at [[Tempe]], a city in [[Thessaly]] to pick laurel, a plant sacred to him. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the [[Pythian Games]] received a laurel wreath picked in Tempe.

Delphi was the site of a major temple to [[Phoebus Apollo]], as well as the [[Pythian Games]] and a famous [[oracle]]. Even in Roman times hundreds of votive statues remained, described by [[Pliny the Younger]] and seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

When young, [[Apollo]] killed the chthonic [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived beside the [[Castalian Spring]], according to some because Python had attempted to rape [[Leto]] while she was pregnant with Apollo and [[Artemis]]. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the [[Oracle]] at Delphi to give her prophesies. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. The shrine dedicated to Apollo was probably originally dedicated to Gaia and then [[Poseidon]].

[[Erwin Rohde]] wrote that the Python was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo, and buried under the Omphalos, and that it is a case of one god setting up his temple on the grave of another. {{rf|1|Rohde1}}

The oracle at that time predicted the future based on the lapping water and leaves rustling in the trees.

==Oracle==

{{Main|Delphic Sibyl}}

The biggest religious phenomenon during this era, which made the biggest impact on traditions, was undoubtedly the oracle at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi on the southern slopes of Mount Parnassos in Central Greece. In the last quarter of the [[8th Century BC]] we see a steady increase of artifacts found at the settlement site in Delphi. Pottery and bronze work and tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in comparison to Olympia. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for worshippers of a wide range, but the strong representation of high value goods are found in no other mainland sanctuary, certainly encourages that view. 

The first [[oracle]] at Delphi was commonly known as [[Delphic Sibyl|Sibyl]] or Pythia, though her name was [[Herophile]]. She sang her predictions, which she received from Gaia. Later, &quot;[[Sibyl]]&quot; became a title given to whichever priestess manned the oracle at the time. The Sibyl sat on the [[Sibylline Rock]], breathing in vapors from the ground {{rf|2|note2}} and gaining her often puzzling predictions from that. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] claimed that the Sibyl was &quot;born between man and goddess, daughter of sea monsters and an immortal nymph&quot;. Others said she was sister or daughter to Apollo. Still others claimed the Sibyl received her powers from Gaia originally, who passed the oracle to [[Themis]], who passed it to [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]].

This oracle exerted considerable influence across the country, and was consulted before all major undertakings: wars, the founding of colonies, and so forth. She also was respected by the semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]], and even [[Egypt]]. [[Croesus]] of Lydia consulted Delphi before attacking Persia, and according to [[Herodotus]] received the answer &quot;if you do, you will destroy a great empire.&quot; Croesus found the response favorable and attacked, and was utterly overthrown (resulting, of course, in the destruction of his own empire).

The oracle is also said to have proclaimed [[Socrates]] the wisest man in Greece, to which Socrates said that if so, this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. This claim is related to one of the most famous mottos of Delphi, which Socrates said he learned there, ''[[Know thyself|Gnothi Seauton]]'' (Γνώθι Σεαυτόν): &quot;know thyself&quot;. Another famous motto of Delphi is ''Meden Agan'' (Μηδέν Άγαν): &quot;nothing in excess&quot;.

In the [[3rd century]] A.D., the oracle (perhaps bribed) declared that the god would no longer speak there.

The temple to Apollo at Delphi was built by [[Trophonius]] and [[Agamedes]].

[[Image:Treasury of Athens at Delphi.JPG|thumb|The Treasury of [[Athens]], built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]]]]

Other archaeologists believe that the oracle also inhaled fumes of burning bay leaves.

==Treasuries==

From the entrance of the site, continuing up the slope almost to the temple itself, is a large number of [[votive deposit|votive]] statues, and numerous treasuries.  These were built by the various states &amp;ndash; those overseas as well as those on the mainland &amp;ndash; to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for advice important to those victories.  The most impressive is the now-restored Treasury of [[Athens]], built to commemorate the Athenians' victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].  The Athenians had previously been given the advice by the oracle to put their faith in their &quot;wooden walls&quot; &amp;ndash; taking this advice to mean their navy, they won a famous battle at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]].  Another impressive treasury that exists on the site was dedicated by the city of [[Siphnos]], who had ammassed great wealth from their silver and gold mines and so they dedicated the [[Siphnian Treasury]].

==Tholos==

[[Image:Delphi_145.jpg|thumb|The Tholos at the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia]]

The Tholos at the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia is a circular building that was constructed between 380 and 360 B.C.  It consisted of 20 Doric columns arranged with an exterior diamater of 14.76 meters, with 10 Corinthian columns in the interior.  The Tholos is located approximately a half-mile (800 m) from the main ruins at Delphi.  Three of the Doric colums have been restored, making it the most popular site at Delphi for tourists to take photographs.

==Modern Delphi==

The modern Delphi or Delfi or Delfoi is situated west of the archaeological site.  It is passed by a major highway linking Amfissa along with Itea and Arachova.  The two main streets are each one-way and narrow.  Delphi also has a school, a lyceum and a square (''[[plateia]]'').  The communities include [[Chrysso (Phokida), Greece|Chrysso]] which in ancient times was Crissa.

However, recent [[geology|geological]] research indicates that the site of the oracle shows young [[geological fault]]s, and it seems plausible that these emitted in ancient times light [[hydrocarbon]] [[gas]]es, possibly [[ethylene]], from [[bitumen|bituminous]] [[limestone]] which do have an [[intoxicating]] effect.

'''Digital Equipment Corporation''' was a pioneering company in the American [[computer]] industry. It is often referred to within the computing industry as '''DEC'''. (This acronym was once officially used by Digital itself&lt;sup&gt;[[Digital Equipment Corporation#References|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;, but later discarded.)  Its PDP and VAX products were arguably the most popular mini-computers for the scientific and engineering communities during the 70s and 80s.  DEC was acquired by [[Compaq]], which subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]].  As of [[2005]] its product lines were still produced under the HP name. For many years its headquarters was in an old woolen mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]].

Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with [[Digital Research]]; the two were unrelated, separate entities (despite some similarities between the operating systems they produced); nor with [[Western Digital]]. 

== History ==
[[Image:KA10 mod end.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A &quot;B&quot; (blue) series Flip Chip module containing 9 transistors, 1971]]
The company was founded in [[1957]] by [[Ken Olsen]] and [[Harlan Anderson]], two engineers who had been working at [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]] on the [[TX-2]] project. The TX-2 was a [[transistor]]-based computer using the then-huge amount of '''64K''' [[36-bit word length|36-bit words]] of [[core memory]]. When that project ran into difficulties, Olsen left to form DEC with Harlan Anderson, a colleague from his MIT days. [[Venture capital]] was provided by [[Georges Doriot]] and his [[American Research and Development Corporation]]. At the time the market was hostile to computer companies, and investors shied from their plans. Instead they started building small digital &quot;modules&quot; (each effectively a single component from the TX-2 design) that could be combined together to be used in a lab setting. In [[1961]] the company was making a profit, and started construction of their first computer, the [[PDP-1]] (PDP being an initialism for [[Programmable Data Processor]]).

The first modules were the free-standing &quot;laboratory modules&quot;, placing one or two gates inside an extruded aluminum housing. These modules could be stacked up in a pre-configured 19&quot; rack shelf that supplied power to the modules; the logic circuits were then established using [[4 mm plug|banana plug]] [[patch cord]]s installed at the front of the modules. The same circuits were then packaged as &quot;[[system module]]s&quot;, which were used to build the PDP-1. The same circuits were then packaged as the first &quot;R&quot; (red) series &quot;[[flip chip|Flip-Chip®]]&quot; modules. Later, other module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities. Digital published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.

=== 8-bit computers ===
The [[VT180]] (codenamed &quot;Robin&quot;) was a [[VT100]] terminal with a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based microcomputer running [[CP/M]].
This evolved into the [[Rainbow-100]], which had both Z80 and [[8088]] CPUs and was capable of running [[CP/M]], [[CP/M-86]], and [[PC-DOS]].

=== 12-bit Computers ===
[[Image:PDP-8.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A PDP-8 on display at the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. This example is from the first generation of PDP-8s, built with discrete transistors and later known as the ''Straight 8''.]]
To serve laboratories at a lower cost, DEC provided the [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-5]], an early minicomputer in 1963.
True success followed with the introduction of the famous [[PDP-8]] in [[1964]].  It was a smaller, 12-bit word machine that sold for about $16,000.  The PDP-8 was small enough to fit on a cart.  It was simple enough to be used for many roles, and they soon started being sold in huge numbers to new market niches, labs, railways, and all sorts of industrial applications.

The PDP-8 was important historically because it was the first computer that was regularly purchased by a handful of end users as an alternative to using a larger system in a data center. Because of their low cost and portability, these machines could be purchased to fill a specific need, unlike the mainframe systems of the day that were nearly always shared among diverse users. Today the PDP-8 is generally regarded as the first [[minicomputer]].
The PDP-8 spawned a cousin, the [[PDP-12]], which merged data acquisition and display capabilities developed with the NIH-sponsored [[LINC]] computers into the PDP-8 architecture.

=== 16-bit computers ===
Another of the famous machines in the PDP series was the [[PDP-11]], which, following an industry trend for 8-bit bytes, used a 16-bit word. PDP-11 machines started in the market essentially as upscale PDP-8s, but as improvements to [[integrated circuit]]s continued, they eventually were packaged in cases no larger than a modern [[Personal Computer|PC]].

The PDP-11 systems supported several operating systems of the day, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Labs']] new [[Unix|UNIX]] operating system as well as DEC's [[RSX]] and [[RSTS]].  Both [[RSTS]] and [[Unix|UNIX]] were available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the sandbox for a generation of engineers and computer scientists.

The PDP-11's 16-bit, byte-oriented architecture provided a 64KB virtual address space.  Most models had a paged physical memory architecture and memory protection features to allow [[time-sharing|timesharing]], and some could support split Instruction &amp; Data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128KB and a physical address size of up to 4MB.

===18-bit Computers ===
[[Image:Vs-dec-pdp-1.jpg|thumb|PDP-1|220px|right|A typical [[PDP-1]] installation.]]

Through the [[1960s]] DEC produced a series of machines aimed at a price/performance point below [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[mainframe]] machines, typically based on an 18-bit word, using core memory: 
the PDP-1, the PDP-2 (proposed, but never built), the PDP-4 (1963), the PDP-7 and [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]] (1965), and finally the [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-15]] series (starting in 1970 and later sold as the &quot;XVM&quot; series).  The PDP-15 was an early user of [[TTL]] [[integrated circuits]]. These computers were moderately powerful computers for their time, mainly used in industrial, scientific, and medical laboratories.

=== 36-bit computers ===
For larger scientific problems DEC produced first the PDP-6 in 1964, using a 36-bit architecture.  Using the same word length of the IBM 701-7094 series, which was being replaced by the 32-bit [[IBM 360]] series, provided an alternative growth path for scientific customers.
The successor was the [[PDP-10]] series, eventually being sold as the [[DECsystem-10]] and [[DECSYSTEM-20]]

=== VAX Computer series ===
[[Image:Vax780 small.jpeg|thumb|220px|right|A representative VAX-11/780 system configuration]]

In [[1976]] DEC decided to move to an entirely new 32-bit platform, which they referred to as the ''[[supermini|super-mini]]''. They released this as the [[VAX]] (Virtual Address eXtension) 11/780 in [[1978]], and immediately took over the vast majority of the minicomputer market. Desperate attempts by competitors such as [[Data General]] (which had been formed in [[1968]] by a former DEC engineer who had worked on a 16-bit design that DEC had rejected) to win back market share failed, due not only to DEC's successes, but the emergence of the [[microcomputer]] and [[workstation]] into the lower-end of the minicomputer market.  In [[1983]], DEC cancelled their [[Jupiter project|&quot;Jupiter&quot; project]], which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as their flagship model.

The VAX series had an instruction set that is rich even by today's standards (as well as an abundance of [[Addressing mode|addressing modes]]).  In addition to the paging and memory protection features of the PDP series, the VAX supported [[virtual memory]]. The VAX could use both Unix and DEC's own [[OpenVMS|VMS]] operating system.

At its peak in the late [[1980s]], Digital was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that they appeared to gain a feeling of invincibility, and branched out into software, producing products for almost every then &quot;hot&quot; niche. This included their own networking system, [[DECnet]], file and print sharing, relational database, and even [[transaction processing]].  Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third party products instead.  This problem was further magnified by Olsen's aversion to advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves.  Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations based on [[RISC]] architecture were starting to approach the VAX in performance. Blinded by their own success of the [[VAX]]/[[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] products which followed the proprietary model, the company executives would later be blind-sided by commodity hardware in the form of [[Intel]]-based personal computers and standards-based software such as [[Unix]] and [[Internet]] protocols such as [[TCP/IP]].  In the early [[1990s]] DEC found its sales faltering, and its first layoffs followed. 

In 1990 DEC was about to launch a new generation of computer disk drives into the marketplace. Code named the [[RA90]], it was the second largest development project ever undertaken by the company. Several major technological innovations were to be simultaneously integrated into this state of the art (at the time) product. Unfortunately, because of product design glitches, the RA90 was very late in coming to market. By the time enough glitches had been resolved to allow limited shipments, competitors had released enhanced technology drives at much lower prices. What could have been a huge win for this organization became a great failure.

=== Alpha ===
During the [[1980s]] DEC made several attempts at designing a [[RISC]] processor to replace the VAX architecture. Eventually, in [[1992]] DEC launched the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processor (initially named '''Alpha AXP''', the &quot;AXP&quot; was later dropped). This was a [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] architecture (as opposed to the 32-bit [[CISC]] architecture used in the VAX) and one of the first 64-bit [[microprocessor]] designs.  The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch, and subsequent variants continued to do so into the [[2000s]].  Alpha-based computers (the DEC AXP series, later the [[AlphaStation]] and [[AlphaServer]] series) superseded both the VAX architecture and the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-based [[DECstation]] line, and could run VMS, [[Unix]] and Microsoft's new server operating system [[Windows NT]].

DEC tried to compete in the Unix market by marketing the VMS operating system as &quot;[[OpenVMS]]&quot; and by selling their own Unix ([[OSF/1 |OSF/1 AXP]], later renamed Digital UNIX), and it began to advertise more aggressively. DEC was simply not prepared to sell into a crowded Unix market however, and furthermore the low end PC-servers running NT (based on [[Intel]] processors) took marketshare from Alpha-based computers. DEC's workstation and server line never gained much popularity beyond former DEC customers.

===Closing DEC's Business===
Ken Olsen was replaced by [[Robert Palmer (computer businessman)|Robert Palmer]] as the company's CEO, but Palmer was unable to stem the tide of red ink and more rounds of layoffs ensued. DEC's database product, [[Oracle Rdb|Rdb]], was sold to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], and its high-end Storageworks disk unit sold to [[Quantum Corporation]]. In May 1997 DEC sued [[Intel]] for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the [[Intel Pentium|Pentium]] chips.  A settlement reached in DEC's favor included sale of DEC's chip business to Intel. In 1997, the printer business was sold to [[GENICOM]] who produced models with the Digital logo.  About the same time its networking business was sold to [[Cabletron Systems]], and eventually the company itself was sold to [[Compaq]] on [[January 26]], [[1998]].  Compaq itself was taken over by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 2002.

The Digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51% subsidiary of DEC). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed &quot;HP GlobalSoft&quot;, and no longer uses the Digital logo nor follows the erstwhile Digital culture of engineering predominance.

== Accomplishments ==
Digital supported the [[ANSI]] standards, especially the [[ASCII]] character set, which survives in [[Unicode]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] character set. Digital's own [[Multinational Character Set]] also had a large influence on the [[Latin-1]] characters in [[ISO 8859-1]] and [[Unicode]].

The first versions of the [[C programming language]] and the [[Unix|UNIX system]] ran on Digital's [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were the first commercially viable [[minicomputer]]s.

Digital also produced the popular [[VAX]] computer family, the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] (AXP) microprocessor, the first commercially successful workstation (the VT-78), and some commercially unsuccessful personal computers.

Digital produced top-line operating systems, like [[OS/8|OS-8]], [[TOPS-10]], [[TOPS-20]], [[RSTS/E]], [[RSX-11]], [[RT-11]], and [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]].  PDP computers, in particular the [[PDP-11]] model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used ([[as of 2004]]) to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. Digital was an early champion of [[time-sharing]] systems, as anybody who has used other operating systems like [[MVS]] or [[VM/CMS]] from [[IBM]] can attest. 

Digital was to the command-line interface (CLI) what Apple was to the GUI: there was history before and innovation after, but it was Digital's OSes that put it together in a complete and definitive form. The command-line interfaces found in the Digital's OSes, eventually to be codified as [[DIGITAL_Command_Language|DCL]], would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLI's; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to Digital's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the &quot;name-dot-extension&quot; file syntax.

VAX and [[Micro-VAX]] computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] formed one of the most important pre-Internet networks, [[DECnet]], which mixed business and research facilities. The [[DECnet]] protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards. 

Digital was one of the major champions of [[Ethernet]]. For multiple generations of computers, Ethernet controllers from Digital were ''de facto'' standard components on many computer boards; in particular, DEC's PCI Fast Ethernet controller family (the 21040 and 21143 series, widely referred to collectively as &quot;Tulip&quot;) was highly successful.

[[Computer cluster|Clustering]], an operating system technology which treated multiple machines as one logical entity was invented by Digital. This technology was the fore-runner to systems like [[Network of Workstations]] which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research. 

The [[VT100]] [[computer terminal]] became the industry standard, and even today terminal emulators such as [[HyperTerminal]], [[PuTTY]] and [[Xterm]] can emulate a VT100 (though most actually emulate its more capable successor, the [[VT220]]).

The [[X Window System]], the first remote-windowing system, was developed by [[Project Athena]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Digital was the primary sponsor for this project. 

[[Dave Cutler]], the operating system guru who led the development of [[RSX-11]]M, [[RSX-11]]M+, [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] and then [[VAXELN]] left Digital in [[1988]] to lead the development of [[Windows NT]]. A rumor (that more likely started as a joke) has circulated for a long time that WNT=VMS+1 (increment each letter by one).

Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAXnotes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as [[Collaborative software|groupware]]. [[Len Kawell]], one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined [[Lotus Development Corporation]] and contributed to their [[Lotus Notes]] product. 

Digital was one of the first commercial businesses connected to the [[Internet]], [http://www.digital.com digital.com] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous ''.com'' domains, and the first commercial website.

The popular [[AltaVista]], created by Digital, was one of the first comprehensive Internet [[search engine]]s (although [[Lycos]] was earlier, it was much more limited).

Invention of [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT).

The '''Dead Kennedys''' are a [[punk rock]] band from [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Attacking assumptions of the [[left-wing politics|political left]] and [[right-wing politics|right]] with humor, their music mixed the more experimental elements of English punk with the energy of the American punk scene. Lead singer [[Jello Biafra]] was also responsible for releasing many other punk and alternative bands on his [[Alternative Tentacles]] [[record label]].

==History==
The Dead Kennedys formed in [[June]] [[1978]], after guitarist [[East Bay Ray]] advertised for band mates.  The original DK lineup consisted of [[Jello Biafra]] on vocals, East Bay Ray on lead guitar, [[6025]] on rhythm guitar, [[Klaus Flouride]] on bass, and [[Ted (musician)|Ted]] on drums. Their first concert was on July 19, 1978, at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco. They played numerous shows at local venues afterwards. Because of the band's provocative name, they sometimes played under [[pseudonyms]], including &quot;The Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Creamsicles&quot;, and &quot;The Pink Twinkies&quot;. 6025 quit in March of 1979 due to musical differences, and being diagnosed with schizophrenia. In June of [[1979]], the band released their first single, &quot;[[California Uber Alles|California Über Alles]]&quot;, on [[Alternative Tentacles]]. They followed with a well received east-coast tour. 

On March 25, 1980, the DKs were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in front of music industry big-wigs to give the event some &quot;new wave credibility&quot; in the words of the organizers. The day of the show was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit &quot;California Über Alles&quot;. In typically [[Subversion (political)|subversive]], perverse style, the band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra said, &quot;Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a [[New Wave music|new wave]] band.&quot; The band, who all wore white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks, to form a dollar sign, then tore into the previously unheard &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, a barbed, [[Satire|satirical]] attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry. As well as containing the lyrics &quot;Is my [[Penis|cock]] big enough, is my [[brain]] small enough, for you to make me a star&quot;, the song also sent-up [[The Knack]]'s biggest new wave hit, &quot;My Sharona&quot;. The song was never recorded in the studio but this performance, the first and only time the song was ever performed, was released on the posthumous compilation album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''... and the band was never invited to play the awards show again.

During the spring of 1980, they recorded and released &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot;. In the fall they released their debut album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]''. It reached #33 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].

In January of 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February. His replacement was [[D.H. Peligro]]. In May, the band released the single &quot;[[Too Drunk To Fuck]]&quot;. The song caused much controversy in the U.K. as BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30; this would require a performance of the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. However, this never came to be as the single peaked at #31. The EP ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) and album ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'' (1982) showed a development in musical style, and their music became a political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the [[religious right]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, during the 1980s and gained a large underground following.

The release of the album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' in 1985 caused a fervor with the newly formed [[PMRC]] (Parents Music Resource Center), and in 1986, the members of the DKs, along with other parties involved in the distribution of ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', were brought to trial for &quot;distribution of harmful matter to minors&quot; due in part to an [[H.R. Giger]] [[Penis_Landscape|illustration]] included with the album. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The band members were each faced with up to a year in jail and a $2000 fine. In 1987, the charges were dropped after a three-week trial. The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide. 

In January of 1986, the DKs decided to break up to pursue other interests. They played their last concert on February 21. During the summer they recorded ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which was released in November. In December, the band announced their split. Biafra went on to become a highly active political force, appearing on numerous television shows and releasing a number of [[spoken-word]] albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.

==Internal conflicts==
It was discovered in the late 1990s that there were issues with the payments each band member had received from their record label [[Alternative Tentacles]].  Former band members claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay less royalty rates to the band members. Although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake, the DKs took issue with the fact that Biafra failed to inform the band of the mistake after he and his co-workers discovered it (though by all accounts he paid the band). Biafra claims that the DKs' lawyers had told him only to correspond through lawyers and not directly with the band, as the conflict over payment had apparently arisen before the accounting mistake was discovered. Both sides claim they attempted to resolve the matter without legal action, but the ultimately complicated legal dispute (involving royalties, publishing rights, and a number of other issues) soon led to the courts, where Biafra was found liable. Biafra's appeal was denied; he had to pay the outstanding fees, and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the three, who claimed that [[songwriting credits]] were due to the entire band (Jello had received sole songwriting credit for most Dead Kennedys songs on all released albums for the last 20 years or so without complaints from the band, though a minority of songs had given credit to certain group members or the entire band as a whole, indicating a system designed to reflect the primary composers rather than a regimented system like the Jagger/Richards partnership; today, most Kennedys reissues list the songwriters as &quot;Biafra, Dead Kennedys&quot; indicating Biafra's lyrical contributions -- which the band doesn't dispute, or else simply as &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot;). Jello's bandmates found new distribution through another label, [[Manifesto Records]].

This dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause, and the case caused minor waves within punk circles. Many fans felt that DKs' lawsuit against Jello was motivated by greed, as the other three band members had numerous unsuccessful solo records and gigs after the band's break-up (Biafra was by far the most prolific and successful of the four). In addition, Biafra claims that guitarist [[East Bay Ray]] had long expressed displeasure with [[Alternative Tentacles]] and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. Some observers felt that although Biafra did not try to cheat his band in any way (as he does not take a salary from Alternative Tentacles), his sneering, irreverent attitude did not endear him to jurors during the trial. Biafra, using his typical tactics, accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot; for use in a Levi's jeans commercial, which the band denied. Biafra apparently pushed this issue in court, although there was no hard evidence and the jurors were apparently unconcerned with corporate use of independently produced political music. Biafra would later complain that the jury was not sympathetic towards underground music and punk culture. The song never appeared in a Levi's commercial, although in interviews Biafra described the situation surrounding the commercial in detail and was able to give specifics about the advertisement.

Biafra's bandmates, under the apparent, though unspoken leadership of [[East Bay Ray]], maintain that they sued because of Jello Biafra's deliberate witholding of money, though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake and that Biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly, however details about this issue remain scarce. The band also maintains that the entire Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them. Ultimately, these issues have led to a souring of relationships with the erstwhile bandmates, who still have not resolved their personal differences as of 2006.

Matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; at a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly (though he was undoubtedly still distressed by having been dragged through numerous lawsuits and by having the entire Dead Kennedys catalog taken from his label’s care). In addition, Biafra was disdainful of the reunion, having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular (with the 1996, corporate-sponsored Sex Pistols reunion perhaps fresh in his mind), flatly stating that the whole affair was an exercise in greed. The re-formed Dead Kennedys, it must be said, followed their court victory by announcing a number of tour dates, released re-issues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', which they did not have the rights to until 2005) and a number of concert DVDs, as well as licensing several songs for use by major corporations (in [[Tony Hawk Pro Skater]] and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' remake, respectively), actions that were extremely controversial among more politically astute fans, but ultimately (and curiously) paid little attention by the press and the groups overall fanbase. Biafra, predictably angry with his former bandmates, did not mince words in criticizing the reunited group, slagging all of the commercially-oriented re-issues and DVDs they released, as well as criticizing them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 80s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. Biafra also attacked them on song called &quot;[[Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)]]&quot;, which appears on his second collaboratory with punk metal band [[The Melvins]], ''[[Sieg Howdy|Sieg Howdy!]]''.

==Reformation==
In 2001, Ray, Peligro and Flouride reformed the group with [[Brandon Cruz]] taking Biafra's role as vocalist (due to the breakdown in communications detailed above).  There has been much debate as to whether this is a reformed DKs, or some form of tribute band, however they have played under the group name &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; as well as the variant &quot;DK Kennedys&quot; (to make the distinction between the original line up including Biafra and possibly to avoid further lawsuits such as the one filed against the new lineup of [[the Doors]] without [[Jim Morrison]]).  Many promoters simply advertise them as &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; regardless, and promotional material has featured pictures of Biafra. The reformed group has played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. These shows included a show in Turkey sponsored by Coke.

Brandon Cruz left the band, citing creative differences. Cruz was replaced by [[Jeff Penalty]] as lead vocalist. The band has released two live albums on Manifesto Records of old performances - ''[[Mutiny On The Bay]]'', an edited-together compilation of various live performances of varying quality from the San Francisco area, and ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'', a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in San Francisco, which was greeted with more enthusiasm. Incidentally, the latter performance was former bandmember 6025's final show with the band. These releases have caused more conflict among the band and its former frontman, and have been denounced by Jello Biafra as an attempt to cash in on the DKs' legacy, who accused the releases of being of poor sound quality and claims to not be receiving royalties from their sale or the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. The other band members deny Biafra's accusations of greed, despite having licensed DKs music, traditionally an expression of anti-corporatism, for use in major corporate endeavors (see above).

==Lyrical stance==
The DKs are noted for the acerbity of their lyrics, which generally take a harsh critique of contemporary America that is staunchly [[left-wing]]. Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, the Kennedys' lyrics are often [[satirical]] and sarcastic. &quot;[[Holiday In Cambodia]]&quot; is a multi-layered satire targeting both [[yuppie]] culture and [[Cambodia]]'s then-current [[Khmer Rouge]] regime (together with the US government who at the time of recording were tacitly supporting [[Pol Pot]] in his war against [[Vietnam]]). Songs such as &quot;[[Kill The Poor]]&quot;, &quot;[[California Über Alles]]&quot; and &quot;[[Police Truck]]&quot; actually take the lyrical viewpoint of the band's hated right-wing targets. In some cases in their early days the band attracted support from right-wing punks who took the lyrics of &quot;Kill The Poor&quot;, etc. at face value, somehow missing the staggering amount of sarcastic nastiness and irony with which the lyrics were presented. The Kennedys wrote a song in response to this development, tellingly titled &quot;[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]&quot;.

The Kennedys' generally Biafra-penned lyrics sometimes employed the deliberately over-the-top shock tactics traditionally associated with punk; but even these songs were often colored by scathing, sometimes black humor; songs like &quot;Holiday In Cambodia&quot; and &quot;[[Chemical Warfare]],&quot; which employed violent, genocidal imagery, are some of the better examples. However, unlike many other punk and hardcore bands who play with such themes, the Kennedys usually have a clear progressive point to make when they shock.

Jello Biafra continues to be a noted critic of the American political establishment, embarking on lecture tours both before and after his time with the band.

NOTE: Please refrain from editing the lead section without first discussing any changes on the discussion page for this article. Arriving at a generally acceptable basic account for the general reader has engaged the considerable efforts of many people. Transforming this section into another highly-accurate-but-impossible-to-read one is something that needs to be avoided. Those who have worked long and hard to formulate this introduction have assumed from the beginning that it is not put forth as a very accurate description, and that it is only meant as a generic overview. Please trust readers to look further into the article for a more nuanced presentation of the fine points. --&gt;   
[[Image:DNA_Overview.png|thumb|270px|The general structure of a section of DNA]]
'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ('''DNA''') is a [[nucleic acid]] &amp;mdash;usually in the form of a double [[helix]]&amp;mdash; that contains the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions specifying the [[developmental biology|biological development]] of all cellular forms of [[life]], and most [[virus]]es.  DNA is a long polymer of [[nucleotides]] and encodes the sequence of the [[amino acid residue]]s in [[protein]]s using the [[genetic code]], a triplet code of [[nucleotide]]s.

In complex [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] such as those from [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungi]] and [[protist]]s, most of the DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]]. By contrast, in simpler cells called [[prokaryotes]], including the [[bacterium|eubacteria]] and [[archaea]], DNA is not separated from the [[cytoplasm]] by a [[nuclear envelope]]. The cellular [[organelle]]s known as [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]] also carry DNA.

DNA is often referred to as the molecule of [[heredity]] as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most [[biological inheritance|inherited]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s. In humans, these traits can range from hair colour to disease susceptibility. During [[cell division]], DNA is [[DNA replication|replicated]] and can be transmitted to offspring during [[reproduction]]. [[Kinship and descent|Lineage]] studies can be done based on the facts that the [[mitochondrial DNA]] only comes from the mother, and the male [[Y chromosome]] only comes from the father.

Every person's DNA, their [[genome]], is inherited from both parents. The mother's [[mitochondrial DNA]] together with twenty-three [[chromosome]]s from each parent combine to form the genome of a [[zygote]], the [[fertilization|fertilized]] [[ovum|egg]]. As a result, with certain exceptions such as [[red blood cell]]s, most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, together with mitochondrial DNA inherited from the mother.

==Overview==

This section presents an introductory and therefore incomplete overview of DNA.
* Genes can be loosely viewed as the organism's &quot;cookbook&quot; or &quot;blueprint&quot;;
* A strand of DNA contains [[gene]]s, areas that [[gene regulation|regulate genes]], and areas that either have no function, or a function [[junk DNA|which we do not (yet) know]]; also see last bullet point in this section for the difference between DNA and RNA;
* DNA is organized as two complementary strands, head-to-toe, with [[hydrogen bond]]s between them that can be &quot;unzipped&quot; like a zipper, separating the strands &amp;mdash; contrary to a common misconception, DNA is not a single molecule, but rather a pair of molecules joined by these bonds;
* DNA is a chain of chemical &quot;building blocks&quot;, called &quot;[[base pair|bases]]&quot;, of which there are four types: these can be abbreviated [[Adenine|A]], [[Thymine|T]], [[Cytosine|C]], and [[Guanine|G]]. Each base can only &quot;pair up&quot; with one single predetermined other base: A+T, T+A, C+G and G+C are the only possible combinations; that is, an &quot;A&quot; on one strand of double-stranded DNA will &quot;mate&quot; properly only with a &quot;T&quot; on the other, complementary strand;
** &lt;small&gt;[[Uracil|U]] replaces T, notably in PBS1 phage DNA; [[Uracil|U]] replaces T in RNA.&lt;/small&gt;
* The allowable base components of nucleic acids can be [[polymerized]] in any order giving the molecules a high degree of uniqueness;
* DNA is an acid because of the phosphate groups between each deoxyribose.  This the primary reason why DNA has a negative charge.
* The &quot;polarity&quot; of each pair is important: A+T is not the same as T+A, just as C+G is not the same as G+C (note that &quot;polarity&quot; as such is never used in this context -- it's just a suggestive way to get the idea across);
* For each given base, there is just one possible complementary base, so naming the bases on the conventionally chosen side of the strand is enough to describe the entire double-strand sequence;
* The genetic [[information]] contained in a strand of DNA is determined by the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of bases along its length;
* The cell begins [[DNA replication]] by forcibly unzipping the DNA double strand down the middle, and then recreates the &quot;other half&quot; of each new single strand by exposing each half to a mixture of the four bases. An enzyme makes a new strand by finding the correct base in the mixture and pairing it with the original strand. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base will be on the new strand, and the cell ends up with an extra copy of its DNA.
* [[Mutation]]s are simply chemical imperfections in this process: a base is accidentally skipped, inserted, or incorrectly copied, or the chain is trimmed, or added to; many basic mutations can be described as combinations of these accidental &quot;operations&quot;. Mutations can also occur through chemical damage (through [[mutagens]]), light ([[Ultraviolet|UV]] damage), or through other more complicated gene swapping events.
*[[Deoxyribozyme|DNA molecules that act as enzymes]] are known in laboratories, but none have been known to be found in life so far.
* In addition to the traditionally viewed duplex form of DNA, DNA can also acquire triplex and quadraplex forms. Here instead of the Watson Crick base pairing, Hoogsten base pairing comes into picture.
* DNA differs from [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) by having a sugar 2-deoxyribose instead of [[ribose]] in its backbone. This is the basic chemical distinction between RNA and DNA.

===DNA pairing===
[[Image:Dna_pairing_aa.gif|thumb|300px|DNA base pairing]]
The paired bases are joined by [[hydrogen bond]]s. This image shows the normal base pairing. And also how on rare occasions, wrong pairing can happen, when [[thymine]] goes into its [[enol]] form or [[cytosine]] goes into its [[imino]] form.

==DNA in practice==

===DNA in crime===
[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA located in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or hair left at the scene of a crime to identify a possible suspect, a process called [[genetic fingerprinting]] or DNA profiling.  In DNA profiling the relative lengths of sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeats]] and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared.  DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by English geneticist [[Alec Jeffreys]], and was first used to convict Colin Pitchfork in 1988 in the [[Enderby murders]] case in [[Leicestershire]], [[England]].  Many jurisdictions require convicts of certain types of crimes to provide a sample of DNA for inclusion in a computerized database.  This has helped investigators solve old cases where the perpetrator was unknown and only a DNA sample was obtained from the scene (particularly in [[rape]] cases between strangers).  This method is one of the most reliable techniques for identifying a criminal, but is not always perfect, for example if no DNA can be
retrieved, or if the scene is contaminated with the DNA of several possible suspects.

===DNA in computation ===
An extremely important note: Despite its biological origins, DNA plays an important role in [[computer science]], both as a motivating research problem and as a method of computation in itself, called [[DNA computing]], not only for biological origins.

As a simple example, research on [[string searching algorithm]]s, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, was motivated by DNA research, where it is used to find specific sequences of nucleotides in a large sequence. In other applications like [[text editor]]s, even simple algorithms for this problem usually suffice, but DNA sequences cause these algorithms to exhibit near-worst-case behavior due to their small number of distinct characters.

[[Database]]s have also been strongly motivated by DNA research, which requires special tools for storing and manipulating DNA sequences. Databases specialized for this purpose are called [[genomic database]]s, and have a number of unique technical challenges associated with the operations of approximate matching, sequence comparison, finding repeating patterns, and homology searching.

In 1994, Leonard Adleman of the [[University of Southern California]] made headlines when he discovered a way of solving the directed [[Hamiltonian path problem]], an [[NP-complete]] problem, using tools from molecular biology, in particular DNA. The new approach, dubbed [[DNA computing]], has practical advantages over traditional computers in power use, space use, and efficiency, due to its ability to highly parallelize the computation (see [[parallel computing]]), although there is labor worth mentioning involved in retrieving the answers. A number of other problems, including simulation of various [[abstract machine]]s, the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], and the bounded version of the [[Post correspondence problem]], have since been analyzed using DNA computing.

Due to its compactness, DNA also has a theoretical role in [[cryptography]], where in particular it allows unbreakable [[one-time pad]]s to be efficiently constructed and used [http://www.citeseer.ist.psu.edu/gehani99dnabased.html].

=== DNA in historical and anthropological study ===

DNA research is also used to follow the course of human populations over time.

DNA evidence is also being used to try to identify the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2706israel.html] [http://www.aish.com/societywork/sciencenature/the_cohanim_-_dna_connection.asp]

DNA has also been used to look at fairly recent issues of family relationships, such as establishing some manner of familial relationship between the descendents of [[Sally Hemings]] and the family of [[Thomas Jefferson]].

==Molecular structure==
[[Image:NA-comparedto-DNA thymineAndUracilCorrected.png|right|400px|thumb|Comparisons between DNA and single stranded RNA with the diagram of the bases showing.]]
Although sometimes called &quot;the molecule of heredity&quot;, DNA macromolecules as people typically think of them are not single molecules. Rather, they are pairs of molecules, which entwine like vines to form a '''double [[helix]]''' (see the illustration at the right).

Each vine-like molecule is a strand of DNA: '''a chemically linked chain of [[nucleotide]]s, each of which consists of a [[sugar]] ([[deoxyribose]]), a [[phosphate]] and one of five kinds of [[nucleobase]]s (&quot;bases&quot;)'''. Because DNA strands are composed of these nucleotide subunits, they are [[polymer]]s.

The diversity of the bases means that there are five kinds of nucleotides, which are commonly referred to by the identity of their bases. These are [[adenine]] (A), [[thymine]] (T), [[uracil]] (U), [[cytosine]] (C), and [[guanine]] (G). U is rarely found in DNA except as a result of chemical degradation of C, but in some viruses, notably PBS1 phage DNA, U completely replaces the usual T in its DNA. Similarly, RNA usually contains U in place of T, but in certain RNAs such as [[transfer RNA]], T is always found in some positions. Thus, the only true difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, 2-deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.

In a DNA double helix, two polynucleotide strands can associate through the [[hydrophobic effect]] and [[pi stacking]]. Specificity of which strands stay associated is determined by [[base pair|complementary pairing]]. Each base forms [[hydrogen bond]]s readily to only one other -- A to T and C to G -- so that the identity of the base on one strand dictates the strength of the association; the more complementary bases exist, the stronger and longer-lasting the association.

The cell's machinery is capable of ''melting'' or disassociating a DNA double helix, and using each  DNA strand as a template for synthesizing a new strand which is nearly identical to the previous strand.  Errors that occur in the synthesis are known as [[mutations]].  The process known as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] (polymerase chain reaction) mimics this process [[in vitro]] in a nonliving system.

Because pairing causes the nucleotide bases to face the helical axis, the sugar and phosphate groups of the nucleotides run along the outside; the two chains they form are sometimes called the &quot;'''backbones'''&quot; of the helix. In fact, it is chemical bonds between the phosphates and the sugars that link one nucleotide to the next in the DNA strand.

==Sequence role==
Within a gene, the sequence of [[nucleotides]] along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence which then defines a [[protein]], that an [[organism]] is liable to manufacture or &quot;[[gene expression|express]]&quot; at one or several points in its life using the information of the sequence.  The relationship between the nucleotide sequence and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequence of the protein is determined by simple cellular rules of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code is made up of three-letter 'words' (termed a codon) formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).  These codons can then be translated with [[messenger RNA]] and then [[transfer RNA]], with a codon corresponding to a particular amino acid.  There are 64 possible codons (4 bases in 3 places &lt;math&gt;4^3&lt;/math&gt;) that encode 20 amino acids. Most amino acids, therefore, have more than one possible codon.  There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying
the end of the coding region, namely the UAA, UGA and UAG codons.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] appears to encode protein.  For example, only about 1.5% of the [[human genome]] consists of protein-coding [[exons]].  The function of the rest is a matter of speculation. It is known that certain nucleotide sequences specify affinity for [[DNA binding protein]]s, which play a wide variety of vital roles, in particular through control of replication and transcription. These sequences are frequently called [[regulatory sequence]]s, and researchers assume that so far they have identified only a tiny fraction of the total that exist. &quot;[[Junk DNA]]&quot; represents sequences that do not yet appear to contain genes or to have a function.  The reasons for the presence of so much [[non-coding DNA]] in [[eukaryotic]] genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]] (&quot;[[C-value]]&quot;) among species represent a long-standing puzzle in DNA research known as the &quot;[[C-value enigma]]&quot;.

Some DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. [[Telomer]]s and [[centromere]]s typically contain few (if any) protein-coding genes, but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes. Some genes code for &quot;RNA genes&quot; (see [[tRNA]] and [[rRNA]]). Some RNA genes code for transcripts that function as regulatory RNAs (see [[RNA interference|siRNA]]) that influence the function of other RNA molecules. The intron-exon structure of some genes (such as immunoglobin and protocadeherin genes) is important for allowing alternative splicing of pre-mRNA which allows several different proteins to be made from the same gene. Some non-coding DNA represents [[pseudogene]]s that can be used as raw material for the creation of new genes with new functions. Some non-coding DNA provided hot-spots for duplication of short DNA regions; such sequence duplication has been the major form of genetic change in the human lineage (see evidence from the [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]]). Exons interspersed with introns
allows for &quot;exon shuffling&quot; and the creation of modified genes that might have new adaptive functions. Large amounts of non-coding DNA is probably adaptive in that it provides chromosomal regions where [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between homologous portions of chromosomes can take place without disrupting the function of genes. Some biologists such as [[Stuart Kauffman]] have speculated that non-coding DNA may modify the rate of evolution of a species.{{fact}}

Sequence also determines a DNA segment's susceptibility to cleavage by [[restriction enzyme]]s, the quintessential tools of [[genetic engineering]]. The position of cleavage sites throughout an individual's genome determines one kind of an individual's &quot;[[DNA fingerprinting|DNA fingerprint]]&quot;.

==Replication==
''Main article:'' [[DNA replication]]
[[image:dna-split.png|frame|DNA replication]]
&lt;!-- summary has been added, below, also include any extra context relevant for this article as well

..[[origin of replication]]...chromosome...plasmid...DNA polymerase...[[mutation]]...[a paragraph including these ideas would be useful and go well here]
--&gt;
DNA replication or DNA synthesis is the process of copying the double-stranded DNA prior to [[cell division]].  The two resulting double strands are generally almost perfectly identical, but occasionally errors in replication or exposure to chemicals, or radiation can result in a less than perfect copy (see [[mutation]]), and each of them consists of one original and one newly synthesized strand. This is called ''[[semiconservative replication]]''.  The process of replication consists of three steps: ''initiation'', ''elongation'' and ''termination''.

==Mechanical biological properties==
''Main article:'' [[Mechanical properties of DNA]].

===Strands association and dissociation===
The hydrogen bonds between the strands of the double helix are weak enough that they can be easily separated by [[enzyme]]s. Enzymes known as [[helicase]]s unwind the strands to facilitate the advance of sequence-reading enzymes such as [[DNA polymerase]]. The unwinding requires that helicases chemically cleave the phosphate backbone of one of the strands so that it can swivel around the other. The strands can also be separated by gentle heating, as used in [[PCR]], provided they have fewer than about 10,000 '''base pairs''' (10 kilobase pairs, or 10 kbp). The intertwining of the DNA strands makes long segments difficult to separate.

===Circular DNA===
When the ends of a piece of double-helical DNA are joined so that it forms a circle, as in [[plasmid]] DNA, the strands are [[knot theory|topologically]] knotted. This means they cannot be separated by gentle heating or by any process that does not involve breaking a strand. The task of unknotting topologically linked strands of DNA falls to enzymes known as [[topoisomerase]]s. Some of these enzymes unknot circular DNA by cleaving two strands so that another double-stranded segment can pass through. Unknotting is required for the replication of circular DNA as well as for various types of [[recombination]] in linear DNA.

===Great length versus tiny breadth===
The narrow breadth of the double helix makes it impossible to detect by conventional [[transmission electron microscope|electron microscopy]], except by heavy staining. At the same time, the DNA found in many cells can be macroscopic in length -- approximately 2 [[meter]]s long for strands in a human chromosome [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/StevenChen.shtml]. Consequently, cells must compact or &quot;package&quot; DNA to carry it within them. This is one of the functions of the chromosomes, which contain spool-like [[protein]]s known as [[histone]]s, around which DNA winds.

===Entropic stretching behavior===
When DNA is in solution, it undergoes conformational fluctuations due to the energy available in the [[thermal bath]]. For [[Entropy|entropic]] reasons, more floppy states are thermally accessible than stretched out states; for this reason, a single molecule of DNA stretches similarly to a rubber band. Using [[optical tweezers]], the entropic stretching behavior of DNA has been studied and analyzed from a [[polymer physics]] perspective, and it has been found that DNA behaves like the ''Kratky-Porod'' [[worm-like chain]] model with a persistence length of about 53 nm.

Furthermore, DNA undergoes a stretching [[phase transition]] at a force of 65 [[Newtons|pN]]; above this force, DNA is thought to take the form that [[Linus Pauling]] originally hypothesized, with the phosphates in the middle and bases splayed outward. This proposed structure for overstretched DNA has been called &quot;P-form DNA,&quot; in honor of Pauling.

===Different helix geometries===
The DNA helix can assume one of three slightly different geometries, of which the &quot;B&quot; form described by [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] is believed to predominate in cells. It is 2 [[nanometre]]s wide and extends 3.4 nanometres per 10 [[Base pair|bp]] of sequence. This is also the approximate length of sequence in which the double helix makes one complete turn about its axis. This frequency of twist (known as the helical ''pitch'') depends largely on stacking forces that each base exerts on its neighbors in the chain.

====Supercoiled DNA====
{{main|Supercoil}}
The B form of the DNA helix twists 360° per 10 bp in the absence of strain. But many molecular biological processes can induce strain. A DNA segment with excess or insufficient helical twisting is referred to, respectively, as positively or negatively &quot;supercoiled&quot;. DNA ''in vivo'' is typically negatively supercoiled, which facilitates the unwinding of the double-helix required for [[transcription (genetics)|RNA transcription]].

====Sugar pucker====
There are four conformations that the [[ribofuranose]] rings in nucleotides can acquire:
# C-2' endo
# C-2' exo
# C-3' endo
# C-3' exo
Ribose is usually in C-3'endo, while deoxyribose is usually in the C-2' endo sugar pucker conformation.
The A and B forms differ mainly in their ''sugar pucker''.  In the A form, the C3' configuration is above the sugar ring, whilst the C2' configuration is below it.  Thus, the A form is described as &quot;C3'-endo.&quot;  Likewise, in the B form, the C2' configuration is above the sugar ring, whilst C3' is below; this is called &quot;C2'-endo.&quot;  Altered sugar puckering in A-DNA results in shortening the distance between adjacent phosphates by around one angstrom.  This gives 11 to 12 base pairs to each helix in the DNA strand, instead of 10.5 in B-DNA.  Sugar pucker gives uniform ribbon shape to DNA, a cylindrical open core, and also a deep major groove more narrow and pronounced that grooves found in B-DNA.

====A and Z helices formation====
The two other known double-helical forms of DNA, called A and [[Z-DNA|Z]], differ modestly in their geometry and dimensions. The A form appears likely to occur only in dehydrated samples of DNA, such as those used in [[crystallography|crystallographic]] experiments, and possibly in hybrid pairings of DNA and [[RNA]] strands. Segments of DNA that cells have [[methylation|methylated]] for regulatory purposes may adopt the Z geometry, in which the strands turn about the helical axis like a mirror image of the B form.

===Non-helical forms===
Other, including non-helical, forms of DNA have been described, for example a side-by-side (SBS) configuration. Indeed, it is far from certain that the B-form double helix is the dominant form in living cells.

A detailed study of the experimental results remaining to be explained by the double helix model is set out in a whole book freely available as a pdf file from:

http://www.notahelix.com/delmonte/new_struct_mol_biol.pdf

and a recent research paper summarises some key experimental data which are better explained by SBS models than by the double helix:

with subsequent correspondence:

http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may252004/1352.pdf

==Strand direction==
The asymmetric shape and linkage of nucleotides means that a DNA strand always has a discernible orientation or directionality. Because of this directionality, close inspection of a double helix reveals that nucleotides are heading one way along one strand (the &quot;''ascending strand''&quot;), and the other way along the other strand (the &quot;''descending strand''&quot;). This arrangement of the strands is called '''antiparallel'''.

===Chemical nomenclature ([[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']])===
For reasons of chemical nomenclature, people who work with DNA refer to the asymmetric ends of (&quot;five prime&quot; and &quot;three prime&quot;). Within a cell, the enzymes that perform [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[DNA transcription|transcription]] read DNA in the &quot;'''[[3' end|3']] to [[5' end|5']] direction'''&quot;, while the enzymes that perform translation read in the opposite direction (on [[RNA|RNA]]). However, because chemically produced DNA is synthesized and manipulated in the opposite or in non-directional manners, the orientation should not be assumed. In a vertically oriented double helix, the [[3' end|3']] strand is said to be ascending while the [[5' end|5']] strand is said to be descending.

===Sense and antisense===
As a result of their antiparallel arrangement and the sequence-reading preferences of enzymes, even if both strands carried identical instead of complementary sequences, cells could properly translate only one of them. The other strand a cell can only read backwards. [[molecular biology|Molecular biologists]] call a sequence &quot;'''sense'''&quot; if it is translated or translatable, and they call its complement  &quot;'''antisense'''&quot;. It follows then, somewhat paradoxically, that the template for transcription is the ''antisense'' strand. The resulting transcript is an RNA replica of the ''sense'' strand and is itself ''sense.''

===Distinction between sense and antisense strands===
A small proportion of genes in [[prokaryotes]], and more in [[plasmids]] and [[viruses]], blur the distinction made above between sense and antisense strands. Certain sequences of their [[genome|genomes]] do double duty, encoding one protein when read 5' to 3' along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction (still 5' to 3') along the other strand. As a result, the genomes of these viruses are unusually compact for the number of genes they contain, which biologists view as an [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]. This merely confirms that there is no biological distinction between the two strands of the double helix. Indeed, typically each strand of a DNA double helix will act as sense and antisense in different regions.

===As viewed by topologists===
Topologists like to note that the juxtaposition of the [[3′ end]] of one DNA strand beside the [[5′ end]] of the other at both ends of a double-helical segment makes the arrangement a &quot;[[crab canon]]&quot;.

==Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and repair of mutations==
In some [[virus]]es DNA appears in a non-helical, single-stranded form. Because many of the [[DNA repair]] mechanisms of cells work only on paired bases, viruses that carry single-stranded DNA [[genome]]s [[mutation|mutate]] more frequently than they would otherwise. As a result, such species may adapt more rapidly to avoid extinction. The result would not be so favorable in more complicated and more slowly replicating organisms, however, which may explain why only viruses carry single-stranded DNA. These viruses presumably also benefit from the lower cost of replicating one strand versus two.

==History of DNA research==
[[Image:JamesWatson.jpg|thumb|200px|[[James D. Watson|James Watson]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]]]
The discovery that DNA was the carrier of genetic information was a process that required many earlier discoveries. The existence of DNA was discovered in the mid 19th century. However, it was only in the early 20th century that researchers began suggesting that it might store genetic information. This was only accepted after the structure of DNA was elucidated by [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in their 1953 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] publication. Watson and Crick proposed the [[central dogma]] of molecular biology in 1957, describing the process whereby proteins are produced from [[cell nucleus|nucleic]] DNA. In 1962 Watson, Crick, and [[Maurice Wilkins]] jointly received the Nobel Prize for their determination of the structure of DNA.

===First isolation of DNA===
Working in the 19th century, biochemists initially isolated DNA and RNA (mixed together) from cell nuclei. They were relatively quick to appreciate the polymeric nature of their &quot;nucleic acid&quot; isolates, but realized only later that nucleotides were of two types--one containing [[ribose]] and the other [[deoxyribose]]. It was this subsequent discovery that led to the identification and naming of DNA as a substance distinct from RNA.

[[Friedrich Miescher]] (1844-1895) discovered a substance he called &quot;nuclein&quot; in 1869. Somewhat later, he isolated a pure sample of the material now known as DNA from the sperm of salmon, and in 1889 his pupil, [[Richard Altmann]], named it  &quot;nucleic acid&quot;.  This substance was found to exist only in the chromosomes.

In 1929 [[Phoebus Levene]] at the [[Rockefeller Institute]] identified the components (the four bases, the sugar and the phosphate chain) and he showed that the components of DNA were linked in the order phosphate-sugar-base.  He called each of these units a [[nucleotide]] and suggested the DNA molecule consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which are the 'backbone' of the molecule.  However Levene thought the chain was short and that the bases repeated in the same fixed order.  [[Torbjorn Oskar Caspersson|Torbjorn Caspersson]] and [[Einar Hammersten]] showed that DNA was a polymer.

===Chromosomes and inherited traits===
[[Max Delbrück]], [[Nikolai V. Timofeeff-Ressovsky]], and [[Karl G. Zimmer]] published results in 1935 suggesting that chromosomes are very large molecules the structure of which can be changed by treatment with [[X-ray]]s, and that by so changing their structure it was possible to change the heritable characteristics governed by those chromosomes.  In 1937 [[William Astbury]] produced the first [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns from DNA.  He was not able to propose the correct structure but the patterns showed that DNA had a regular structure and therefore it might be possible to deduce what this structure was.

In 1943, [[Oswald Theodore Avery]] and a team of scientists discovered that traits proper to the &quot;smooth&quot; form of the ''Pneumococcus'' could be transferred to the &quot;rough&quot; form of the same bacteria merely by making the killed &quot;smooth&quot; (S) form available to the live &quot;rough&quot; (R) form. Quite unexpectedly, the living R ''Pneumococcus'' bacteria were transformed into a new strain of the S form, and the transferred S characteristics turned out to be heritable. Avery called the medium of transfer of traits the [[transforming principle]]; he identified DNA as the transforming principle, and not [[protein]] as previously thought. He essentially redid [[Fredrick Griffith]]'s experiment. In 1953, [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] did an experiment [[Hershey-Chase experiment| (Hershey-Chase experiment) ]] that showed, in [[T2 phage]], that DNA is the [[genetic material]] (Hershey shared the Nobel prize with Luria).

[[Image:FirstSketchOfDNADoubleHelix.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francis Crick]]'s first sketch of the [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] double-helix pattern]]
In 1944, the renowned physicist, [[Erwin Schrödinger]], published a brief book entitled ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)| What is Life?]]'', where he maintained that chromosomes contained what he called the &quot;hereditary code-script&quot; of life.  He added: &quot;But the term code-script is, of course, too narrow. The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law-code and executive power -- or, to use another simile, they are architect's plan and builder's craft -- in one.&quot;  He conceived of these dual functional elements as being woven into the molecular structure of chromosomes.  By understanding the exact molecular structure of the chromosomes one could hope to understand both the &quot;architect's plan&quot; and also how that plan was carried out through the &quot;builder's craft.&quot;  Three groups took up Schrödinger's challenge to work out the structure of the chromosomes and the question of how the segments of the chromosomes that were conceived to relate to specific traits could
possibly do their jobs.

Just how the presence of specific features in the molecular structure of chromosomes could produce traits and behaviors in living organisms was unimaginable at the time. Because chemical dissection of DNA samples always yielded the same four nucleotides, the chemical composition of DNA appeared simple, perhaps even uniform. Organisms, on the other hand, are fantastically complex individually and widely diverse collectively. Geneticists did not speak of genes as conveyors of &quot;information&quot; in such words, but if they had, they would not have hesitated to quantify the amount of information that genes need to convey as vast. The idea that information might reside in a chemical in the same way that it exists in text--as a finite alphabet of letters arranged in a sequence of unlimited length--had not yet been conceived. It would emerge upon the discovery of DNA's structure, but few researchers imagined that DNA's structure had much to say about genetics.

===Discovery of the structure of DNA===
In the 1950s, three groups made it their goal to determine the structure of DNA. The first group to start was at [[King's College London]] and was led by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and was later joined by [[Rosalind Franklin]].  Another group consisting of [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] was at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  A third group was at [[Caltech]] and was led by [[Linus Pauling]].  Crick and Watson built physical models using metal rods and balls, in which they incorporated the known chemical structures of the nucleotides, as well as the known position of the linkages joining one nucleotide to the next along the polymer. At King's College Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin examined [[crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] patterns of DNA fibers.  Of the three groups, only the London group was able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure.

[[Image:DNA-labels.png|thumb|200px|The chemical structure of DNA]]

====Helix structure====
In 1948 Pauling discovered that many proteins included helical (see [[alpha helix]]) shapes. Pauling had deduced this structure from X-ray patterns. (Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical structure based on Astbury's data.)  Even in the initial diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, it was evident that the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases pointed toward the helical axis or away, and ultimately what were the explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.

====Complementary nucleotides====
In their modeling, Watson and Crick restricted themselves to what they saw as chemically and biologically reasonable. Still, the breadth of possibilities was very wide. A breakthrough occurred in 1952, when [[Erwin Chargaff]] visited Cambridge and inspired Crick with a description of experiments Chargaff had published in 1947. Chargaff had observed that the proportions of the four nucleotides vary between one DNA sample and the next, but that for particular pairs of nucleotides -- adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine -- the two nucleotides are always present in equal proportions.

====Watson and Crick's model====
[[Image:DNA Model Crick-Watson.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Crick and Watson DNA model built in 1953, currently on display at the [[National Science Museum]] in London.]]

[[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] had begun to contemplate double helical arrangements, but they lacked information about the amount of twist (pitch) and the distance between the two strands. [[Rosalind Franklin]] had to disclose some of her findings for the [[Medical Research Council]] and Crick saw this material through [[Max Perutz|Max Perutz's]] links to the MRC.  Franklin's work confirmed a double helix that was on the outside of the molecule and also gave an insight into its symmetry, in particular that the two helical strands ran in opposite directions.

Watson and Crick were again greatly assisted by more of Franklin's data.  This is controversial because Franklin's critical X-ray pattern was shown to Watson and Crick without Franklin's knowledge or permission. Wilkins showed the famous Photo 51 to Watson at his lab immediately after Watson had been unsuccessful in asking Franklin to collaborate to beat Pauling in finding the structure.

From the data in photograph 51 Watson and Crick were able to discern that not only was the distance between the two strands constant, but also to measure its exact value of 2 nanometres. The same photograph also gave them the 3.4 nanometre-per-10 bp &quot;pitch&quot; of the helix.

The final insight came when Crick and Watson saw that a complementary pairing of the bases could provide an explanation for Chargaff's puzzling finding. However the structure of the bases had been incorrectly guessed in the textbooks as the [[enol]] [[tautomer]] when they were more likely to be in the [[keto]] form. When [[Jerry Donohue]] pointed this fallacy out to Watson, Watson quickly realised that the pairs of adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine were almost identical in shape and so would provide equally sized 'rungs' between the two strands.  With the base-pairing, the Watson and Crick quickly converged upon a model, which they announced before Franklin herself had published any of her work.

Franklin was two steps away from the solution.  She had not guessed the base-pairing and had not appreciated the implications of the symmetry that she had described.  However she had been working almost alone and did not have regular contact with a partner like Crick and Watson, and with other experts such as Jerry Donohoe.  Her notebooks show that she was aware both of Jerry Donohue's work concerning tautomeric forms of bases (she had used the keto forms for three of the bases) and of Chargaff's work.

The disclosure of Franklin's data to Watson has angered some people who believe Franklin did not receive due credit at the time and that she might have discovered the structure on her own before Crick and Watson.  In Crick and Watson's famous paper in Nature in 1953, they said that their work had been stimulated by the work of Wilkins and Franklin, whereas it had been the basis of their work.  However they had agreed with Wilkins and Franklin that they all should publish papers in the same issue of Nature in support of the proposed structure.

====&quot;Central Dogma&quot;====
Watson and Crick's model attracted great interest immediately upon its presentation. Arriving at their conclusion on [[February 21]] [[1953]], Watson and Crick made their first announcement on [[February 28]]. Their paper [http://www.nature.com/genomics/human/watson-crick/ 'A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid'] was published on April 25. In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the &quot;[[Central Dogma]]&quot;, which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the &quot;sequence hypothesis.&quot; A critical confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 in the form of the [[Meselson-Stahl experiment]]. Work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of codons, and [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and others deciphered the [[genetic code]] not long afterward. These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].

[[James D. Watson|Watson]], [[Francis Crick|Crick]], and [[Maurice Wilkins|Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for discovering the molecular structure of DNA, by which time [[Rosalind Franklin|Franklin]] had died from cancer, at the age of 37. Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously; had she lived, the difficult decision over whom to jointly award the prize would have been complicated as the prize can only be shared between two or three.

'''Democracy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;delta;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;omicron;&amp;kappa;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;#943;&amp;alpha; (demokratia), &amp;delta;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (demos) ''the common people'' +  &amp;kappa;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu; (kratein) ''to rule'' +  the suffix &amp;#943;&amp;alpha; (ia),  literally &quot;the common people rule&quot;) is a system where the population of a [[society]] controls the [[government]]. It may be narrowly defined as that of [[nation-state]] government specifically, or more broadly to describe a society as a whole, which can also exert [[political power|political power]] and [[power (sociology)|social power]].

Democratic ''government'' aspires to serve under &quot;the people&quot; rather than ruling over them. This ideal is pursued by implementing some form of a [[voting system]], usually involving indirect [[representative democracy|representation]] (see also [[republic]]).

[[Liberal democracy]] is defined as democracy over an entire society, and implies [[individual rights|individual]] [[liberty]] and individual responsibility as a [[citizenship|citizen]] of that society. It extends the concept of distributed power all of the way to individual citizens in their personal domains - personal sovereignty and [[private property]] tempered by civic duty. In such a society, sovereignty originates in the people and is delegated to government rather than vice versa.

Because democratic government and democratic society are inter-related and used interchangeably, they are often confused, usually when one expects all of the benefits of democratic society to follow from the mechanisms of democratic government. While a democratic society has a democratic government, the reverse is not always true. A democratic government, while preventing [[despotism]] of abuse of power by a governing minority, does not protect other minorities from social forces from other members of society with other forms of power that may be played out through [[plutocracy]] within an existing democratic government, or [[majoritarianism]]. Democratic governments may be &quot;liberal&quot;, where fundamental rights of individuals in the minority are protected by law, or they may be &quot;illiberal&quot; where they are not.

== Democratic government ==
Democracy is often implemented as a [[form of government]] in which policy is decided by the preference of the [[True democracy|real majority]], as opposed to a partial or relative majority of the demos or citizens, in a decision-making process, generally [[consensus decision-making]],  usually  [[election|elections]] or [[referenda]], open to all or most [[citizenship|citizens]].  In recent decades 'democracy' was used as a synonym for [[western world|western]] [[liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] systems in [[nation-state]]s, but the existence of &quot;[[illiberal democracy|illiberal democracies]]&quot; is now recognised. The qualifier &quot;liberal&quot; in this context refers strictly speaking to [[constitutional liberalism]] and individual rights, but &quot;liberal democracy&quot; is widely used to describe other aspects that arise. Definitions of democracy have in any case broadened to include aspects of society and political culture in democratic societies, which are not specifically a &quot;form of government&quot;. Most liberal-democracies are parliamentary [[representative democracy|representative democracies]], but there are many [[Democracy (varieties)|varieties of democracy]], some still hypothetical. The term &quot;democratic&quot; is also used in a looser sense, to describe participatory decision-making in groups or organizations.

Indeed, due to implications of comparative government, other preferred governments included: theocracy, monarchy, parliamentary republic, and republic. Since there are these other forms of government, the preference for the democratic form is itself an [[ideology]], and a source of conflict. Despite its historical importance, there is no separate name for this ideology; it is referred to as 'pro-democracy' or simply 'democracy'. It is a [[Universalism|universal]] ideology: most supporters of democracy consider it to be the only [[ethics|ethically legitimate]] form of government, and believe it should replace all other forms of government. [[Democratization]] is the replacement of these non-democratic forms by a democracy. If it continues, some consider that this process will make the liberal-democratic nation-states the standard form of human [[society]], although they are historically recent and historically unique. This transition is the core of the [[end of history]] thesis.

==History of democracy==
{{main|History of democracy}}
An early form of democracy was used by [[republic]]s  of [[Mahajanapadas|Maha Janapadas]] in [[ancient India]] before the [[6th century BC]], before the time of [[Buddhism]]. &lt;ref&gt; Steve Muhlberger, ([[February 8]], [[1998]]). [http://www.nipissingu.ca/department/history/MUHLBERGER/HISTDEM/INDIADEM.HTM Democracy in Ancient India]. Retrieved [[February 19]], [[2006]]. &lt;/ref&gt; Among these states, [[Vaishali]] was the first [[oligarchic]] republic of the world. Later on, during the time of [[Alexander the Great]] during the [[4th century BC]], the Greeks came in contact with two of these republics, the Sabarcae and Sambastai states in what is now [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], whose &quot;form of government was democratic and not regal&quot; according to Greek scholars at the time.

The term &quot;democracy&quot; in the original word in Ancient Greek - was coined in [[ancient Athens]] in the [[5th century BC]]. [[Athenian democracy]] is generally seen as one of the earliest examples of a system corresponding to ''some'' of the modern notions of democratic rule. Only a sixth or a quarter of the whole adult male population of Athens could vote; but this was a bar of [[nationality]], like the present German franchise, not of economic status: however poor they were, all Athenian citizens were free to vote and speak in the Assembly. Ancient Athenian citizens made decisions directly, rather than voting for representatives.

Over time, the meaning of &quot;democracy&quot; has changed, and the modern definition has largely evolved since the [[18th century]], alongside the successive introduction of &quot;democratic&quot; systems in many nations.

[[Freedom House]] argues that there was not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage in the world in [[1900]] although this statement is inaccurate as [[New Zealand]] achieved universal suffrage well before this date, but that today 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% are such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 19% of the world's nations with &quot;restricted democratic practices&quot; in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the presnet. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule. Some states have changed their regimes after 2000, for example [[Nepal]] which has become a non-democracy after the government assumed [[emergency powers]] because of defeats in the [[Nepalese civil war]].

===20th century waves of democracy===
The [[20th century]] expansion of democracy has not taken the form of a slow transition in each country, but as successive &quot;waves of democracy&quot;, some associated with [[war]]s and [[revolution]]s. In several cases there was an explicit imposition of democracy by external military force. To some supporters of democracy, this is a 'liberation', implying that no prior consent is required. The [[World War I]] resulted in the creation of new nation-states in Europe, most of them nominally democratic. It did not at first affect the existing democracies: France, Britain, Belgium and Switzerland kept their system of government, the [[German Revolution|revolutionary violence]] in Germany subsided, and the democratic [[Weimar Republic]] was established. The rise of [[fascism|fascist]] movements, and fascist regimes in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Mussolini]] in Italy, [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in [[Spain]] and [[Salazar]]'s regime in Portugal]], limited the extent of democracy in the 1930s, and gave the impression of an &quot;Age of Dictators&quot;. The status of most [[colonies]] remained unaffected. However democracy is evident from earlier years. For example during the Second GreatAwaking, beginning in the 1790s and last for 40 years, where religion became more democractic as people shifted away from [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] ideas during the 1820s-1830s.

[[World War II]] brought a definitive reversal of this trend, in western Europe. At the time, and since, it was seen as a &quot;Victory for Democracy&quot;, showing that democracy can be extended by military force. The [[Allied Control Council|occupation of Germany]] and its successful ‘democratisation from above’, served as a model for the later theory of [[regime change]]. However, most of Eastern Europe became part of the non-democratic [[Soviet bloc]]. Unlike World War I, the war brought [[decolonisation]], and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions.

In the decades following World War II, most western democratic nations had a [[mixed economy]] and developed a [[welfare state]], reflecting a consensus among their electorates and political parties. In the 1950’s and 1960’s, economic growth was high in both the western and ‘communist’ countries, later it declined in the state-controlled economies, and in some western countries. Economic malaise in the 1980’s contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the associated end of the Cold War, and the [[democratisation]] and [[liberalisation]] of the former Soviet bloc countries, including newly independent [[Soviet Republic]]s. To western public opinion, and to part of their population, this also was a ‘liberation’. To a large section of their population, often the majority, the resulting economic collapse, and the sudden disappearance of state health and welfare provisions was a disaster. The sense of disillusion contributed to a political backlash, the rise of [[illiberal democracy]] in [[Central Asia]], and a trend to [[authoritarian]] rule in Russia itself. The most successful of the ‘new democracies’ were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the [[European Union]]. The initial negative effects of the ‘free-market reforms’ were corrected to some extent by the re-introduction of social services and programs, although not at western European level.

Although economic systems are in theory distinct from political systems, the [[centrally planned economy]] of the communist era is no longer seen as compatible with democracy. All modern democratic societies have a free-market economy, (although not in the sense that [[libertarian]]s would accept). However, it is possible for a democratic electorate to vote for a centrally planned economy.

By 1960, the vast majority of the world's nation-states were nominally independent democracies, although the majority of the world's populations lived in nations that experienced sham elections, &quot;limited democracy&quot;, &quot;one-party system&quot;, &quot;two-party system&quot;, &quot;president for life&quot; and other forms of subterfuge. Subsequent waves of democratization brought substantial leaps toward true representative or direct democracy to nations that already claimed the title. Eastern Europe and some of Central Asia in the 90s, much of Latin America and Southeast Asia, Taiwan and S Korea in the 90s and 00's, and some Arab states, notably Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority.

==Essential elements of a democracy==
True democracy as a form of government always has the following characteristics:

* there is constrained freedom to further the public good. Stated in negative terms, limits, sometimes vigorous ones, are essential to ensure that acts that infringe upon others freedom, such as [[murder]] and [[theft]], do not occur. This may be thought of as [[negative liberty]]. Stated in positive terms, infinite freedom is of the essence to explore within, but not exceed, the boundaries defined by the edge of chaos, such as populist revolutions which identify, advocate for, and create consensus around new forms of government that can achieve both the social justice envisioned by Karl Marx and the economic prosperity envisioned by Adam Smith, but without [[fascism]], [[anomie]], or [[violence]]. This is thought of as [[positive liberty]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kim J. Vicente, (1999). ''Cognitive Work Analysis : Toward Safe, Productive, and Healthy Computer-Based Work''. ISBN 0805823972.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* there is a ''demos'', a group which makes political decisions by some form of collective procedure. Non-members of the demos do not participate. In modern democracies the demos is the [[nation]], and [[citizenship]] is usually equivalent to membership.
* there is a ''territory'' where the decisions apply, and where the demos is resident. In modern democracies, the territory is the [[nation-state]], and since this corresponds (in theory) with the homeland of the nation, the demos and the reach of the democratic process neatly coincide. Colonies of democracies are not considered democratic in themselves, if they are governed from the colonial [[motherland]]: demos and territory do not coincide.
* there is a ''decision-making procedure'', which is either direct, in an instances such as a [[referendum]], or indirect, of which instances include the election of a [[parliament]].
* the procedure is regarded as ''legitimate'' by the demos, implying that its outcome will be accepted. [[Legitimacy (political science)|Political legitimacy]] is the willingness of the population to accept decisions of the [[state]], its government and courts, which go against personal choices or interests. It is especially relevant for democracies, since elections have both winners and losers.
* the procedure is ''effective'' in the minimal sense that it can be used to change the government, assuming there is sufficient support for that change. Showcase elections, pre-arranged to re-elect the existing regime, are not democratic.
* the demos has a long-term ''unity'' and continuity, from one decision-making round to the next, without [[secession]] of the minority.
* in the case of nation-states, the state must be [[sovereignty|sovereign]]: democratic elections are pointless if an outside authority can overrule the result.

However, that the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized the attempt to define democracy with a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. &lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Blattberg]], (2000). From Pluralist to Patriotic Politics: Putting Practice First'', [[Oxford University Press]], ch. 5. ISBN 0-19-829688-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four conceptions of democracy===
Among political theorists, there are at least four major contending conceptions of democracy.

On one account, called minimalism, democracy is a system of government in which citizens give teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not “rule” because on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not very intelligent. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy'' &lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. ISBN 0061330086.&lt;/ref&gt;. Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William Riker, Adam Przeworksi, and [[Richard Posner]].

A second view is called the aggregative conception of democracy. It holds that government should be a system that produces laws and policies that conform to the vector-sum of citizens’ preferences. A good democratic government is one that produces laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter &amp;mdash; with half to his left and the other half to his right. [[Anthony Downs]] laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. &lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harpercollins College. ISBN 0060417501.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third conception, [[deliberative democracy]], is based on the notion that democracy is government by discussion. Deliberative democrats contend that laws and policies should be based upon reasons that all citizens can accept. The political arena should be one in which leaders and citizens make arguments, listen, and change their minds.

[[Participatory democracy]], a fourth conception, holds that citizens should participate directly, not through their representatives, in making laws and policies. Proponents of participatory democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

===Political legitimacy and democratic culture===
All forms of government depend on their [[Legitimacy (political science)|political legitimacy]], that is, their acceptance by the population. Without that, they are little more than a party in a [[civil war]], since their decisions and policies will be resisted, probably by force. Apart from those with anti-statist objections, such as [[anarchism|anarchists]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], most people are prepared to accept their governments as necessary. Failure of political legitimacy in modern states is usually related to [[separatism]] and ethnic or religious conflicts, rather than political differences. However there are historical examples, notably the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the population split along political lines.

In a democracy, a high degree of political legitimacy is necessary, because the [[elections|electoral process]] periodically divides the population into 'winners' and 'losers'. A successful democratic political culture implies that the losing parties and their supporters accept the judgment of the voters, and allow for the peaceful transfer of power - the concept of a &quot;[[loyal opposition]]&quot;. Ideally political competitors may disagree, but acknowledge the other side's legitimate role, and ideally society encourages tolerance and civility in public debate. This form of political legitimacy implies that all sides share common fundamental [[values]]. Voters must know that the new government will not introduce policies they find totally abhorrent. Shared values, rather than democracy as such, guarantee this.

Free elections alone are not sufficient for a country to become a true democracy; the culture of the country's political institutions and [[civil service]] must also change. This is an especially difficult cultural shift to achieve in nations where transitions of power have historically taken place through violence. There are various examples, such as [[Revolutionary France]], modern [[Uganda]] and [[Iran]], of countries that were able to sustain democracy only in limited form until wider cultural changes occurred to allow true majority rule.

===Comparison of direct and representative democracy===
The definition of the word &quot;democracy&quot; from the time of ancient Greece up to now has not been constant. In contemporary usage, the term &quot;democracy&quot; refers to a government chosen by the people, whether it is direct or representative.

There is another definition of democracy, particularly in constitutional theory and in historical usages and especially when considering the works of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].  According to this usage, the word &quot;democracy&quot; refers solely to [[direct democracy]], whilst a [[representative democracy]] where representatives of the people govern in accordance with a constitution is referred to as a republic. This older terminology retains some popularity in United States [[Political conservatism|conservative]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] debate.

The original framers of the [[United States Constitution]] were notably cognizant of what they perceived as a danger of majority rule in oppressing freedom of the individual. For example, [[James Madison]], in [[Federalist Papers|Federalist Paper No. 10]] advocates a [[republic]] over a democracy precisely to protect the individual from the majority. &lt;ref&gt;James Madison, ([[November 22]], [[1787]]). [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10 &quot;The Federalist No. 10 - The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection (continued)&quot;], ''Daily Advertiser''. [[New York]]. Republished by [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, the framers carefully created democratic institutions and major [[open society]] reforms within the United StatesConstitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights]].  They kept what they believed were the best elements of democracy, but mitigated by a balance of power and a layered federal structure.

Modern definitions of the term &quot;republic&quot;, however, refer to any [[state]] with an elective [[head of state]] serving for a limited term, in contrast to most contemporary [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] which are representative democracies and [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] adhering to [[parliamentarism]]. Older [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] are also not considered to be republics.

==Liberal democracy==
{{main|Liberal democracy}}

In common usage, ''democracy'' is often understood to be the same as ''liberal democracy''. The minimal characteristics of democracy (listed above) are not generally considered to make a democracy 'liberal'. In practice, the term now denotes a collection of defining criteria, some of which are unrelated to each other. They are sometimes presented as a list of demands, to be fulfilled during a [[democratisation]] process. Note that many liberal democracies have emergency powers which can make them temporarily less liberal, if applied (by the executive, parliament, or via referenda).

Liberal democracy is, strictly speaking, a form of [[representative democracy]] where the [[political power]] of the government is moderated by a [[constitution]] which protects the [[right]]s and [[political freedom|freedoms]] of individuals and [[minority|minorities]] (also called constitutional liberalism). The constitution therefore places constraints on the extent to which the [[majoritarianism|will of the majority]] can be exercised. Usually, the executive and parliament are constitutionally subject to the [[rule of law]], but some liberal democracies allow no judicial review of constitutionality. Theorists consider these to be the most important 'liberal' element of liberal democracy, but the term is widely used for other elements. In any case, institutional protection for specific minority rights limits the democratic power of the ''majority'', on those specific issues, and can not in itself resolve a conflict between the two groups. Democracies without protection of minority rights are now often called [[illiberal democracy|illiberal democracies]].

The term &quot;liberal&quot; in &quot;liberal democracy&quot; does not imply that the government of such a democracy must follow the political ideology of [[liberalism]]. It is merely a reference to the fact that the initial framework for modern liberal democracy was created by liberals of the late [[18th century|18th]] and early [[19th century|19th]] centuries. Since then, many non-liberals have given their support to liberal democracy - and, indeed, contributed to its growth.

Liberal democracy is sometimes the [[de facto]] form of government, while other forms are technically the case; for example, [[Canada]] has a [[Canadian monarchy|monarchy]], but is in fact ruled by a democratically elected [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]. In the United Kingdom, the sovereign is the hereditary monarch, but the de facto (legislative) sovereign is the people, via their elected representatives in Parliament, hence a democracy.

===Preconditions and structure===
Although they are not a system of government as such, it is now common to include aspects of society among the defining criteria of a liberal democracy. The presence of a [[middle class]], and a broad and flourishing [[civil society]] are often seen as pre-conditions for liberal democracy.

Western support for democratisation is almost always associated with support for a [[market economy]]. In western countries, they do seem inseparable, but that is a geographically and historically limited view. [[China]], which is certainly not a liberal democracy, has a free market economy. The emergence of [[capitalism]] pre-dates the emergence of democracy, which leads some theorists to conclude that there is a historical sequence at work, and that market economics is not only a precondition, but will ultimately ''ensure'' the transition to democracy, in countries such as China. However, many [[Marxism|Marxists]] and [[socialism|socialists]] say that [[capitalism]] and true democracy are at best unrelated and at worst contradictory.

The most [[liberalism|liberal]] of the many criteria now used to define liberal democracy, or simply &quot;democracy&quot;, is the requirement for political [[pluralism]], which is usually defined as the presence of multiple and distinct [[political parties]]. The liberal-democratic political process should be ''competitive'', and analogies with economic markets are often used in this context.

The liberal-democratic [[constitution]] defines the democratic character of the state. In the American political tradition, the purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government, and American ideas of liberal democracy are influenced by this. They emphasise the [[separation of powers]], an independent judiciary, and a system of [[checks and balances]] between branches of government. European constitutional liberalism is more likely to emphasise the ''Rechtsstaat'', usually translated as [[rule of law]], although it implies a specific form of [[state]] or [[regime]].

Liberal democracy is also defined by [[universal suffrage]], granting all citizens the right to vote regardless of race, gender or property ownership. However, the universality is relative: many countries regarded as democratic have practised various forms of [[Suffrage#Forms of exclusion from suffrage|exclusion from suffrage]], or demand further qualifications (except for being a citizen), like a registration procedure to be allowed to vote. Voting rights are limited to those who are above a certain age, typically 18. In any case, decisions taken through elections are taken not by all of the citizens, but rather by those who choose to participate by voting.

===Liberal freedoms===
The most often quoted criteria for liberal democracy take the form of specific rights and freedoms. They were originally considered essential for the functioning of a liberal democracy, but they have acquired such prominence in its definition, that many people now think they are democracy. Since no state wants to admit it is &quot;unfree&quot;, and since its enemies may be depicted as 'tyrannies' by its propagandists, they are also usually contested.

In practice, democracies do have specific limits on specific freedoms. In democratic theory, the common justification for these limits is that they are necessary to guarantee the existence of democracy, or the existence of the freedoms themselves. According to this argument, allowing free speech for the opponents of free speech logically undermines free speech. In Europe, this has become a political issue with the rise of [[Islamism|Islamist]] political argument, which often does explicitly reject such liberal freedoms. Opinion is divided on how far democracy can extend, to include the enemies of democracy in the democratic process.

*[[Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression]], including speech, assembly and protest. There are various legal limitations like [[copyright]] and [[defamation]], more general restrictions may include restrictions on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine [[human rights]], on the promotion or justification of [[terrorism]], and in some cases on &quot;anti-western&quot; ideas. In the United States more than in Europe, during the [[Cold War]], such restrictions generally applied to [[Communism|Communists]], now they are mainly applied to Islamists.
*[[Freedom of the press]] and access to alternative information sources is considered a characteristic of liberal democracy. For certain groups, however, it may be limited: [[Islamist]] media now face restrictions in many democracies, including [[censorship]] of satellite broadcasting in France, and proposed bans on Islamist websites in several countries.
*[[Freedom of association]] is also restricted in democracies, for groups considered a threat to state or society. Most democracies have procedures to ban organisations, on suspicion of [[terrorism]], for instance, and usually without a prior judicial procedure. The [[European Union]] has an official list of banned organisations, overriding the freedom of association in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the national constitutions.
*Equality before the law and [[due process]] under the [[rule of law]] is considered a characteristic of liberal democracy, but the United States holds certain categories of prisoners in [[Guantanamo Bay]], and possibly in other secret prisons, without trial, and without any specific grounds in domestic or international law. If relatively small numbers of people, seen as mortal enemies by the majority of the population, are excluded from legal protections, a country may still be seen as a liberal democracy: it is not qualitatively different from repressive autocracy, but ''quantitatively'' different.

===Comparison of proportional and majoritarian representation===
Some electoral systems, such as the various forms of [[proportional representation]], attempt to ensure that all political groups, including minority groups that vote for minor parties, are represented &quot;fairly&quot; in the nation's legislative bodies, according to the proportion of total votes they cast; rather than the proportion of electorates in which they can achieve a regional majority majoritarian representation.

This proportional versus majoritarian dichotomy is not just a theoretical problem, as both forms of electoral system are common around the world; each creates a very different kind of government. One of the main points of contention is whether to use the system of using representatives who are able to represent small regions in a country, versus having all citizens' vote count the same, regardless of where in the country they happen to live. Some countries such as [[Germany]] and [[New Zealand]] have a large proportion of representatives elected from constituencies and then shares out compensating mandates so that parties are represented proportionally, so as to get balance both needs. This system is commonly called [[mixed member proportional representation]].

===Social democracy===
{{main|Social democracy}}

Social democracy can be considered to be derived from [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Communism|communist]] ideas, in a [[progressivism|progessive]], gradualist and constitutional setting. Many social democratic parties in the world are evolutions of revolutionary parties that, for ideologic or pragmatic reasons, came to embrace a strategy of gradual change through existing institutions, or a policy of working for liberal reforms prior to more profound social change, instead of sudden revolutionary change. It may for example, involve [[progressivism]].

In North America and Western Europe, most parties calling themselves ''socialist'' or ''communist'' are in actuality social democratic, according to the definition given here. In some extreme cases, as in [[Portugal]]'s [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic party]], the name actually indicates a right-wing party.

In general, the hallmarks of social democracy are:
*[[Regulation|Market regulation]];
*[[Social security]], also known as [[welfare state]];
*Subsidized or government-owned [[public school]] and [[public health]] services;
*[[Progressive taxation]].

Furthermore, for ideological affinity or other reasons, most social democrats are also associated with [[environmentalism]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[secularity]].

Countries often indicated as social democracies are the [[Nordic countries]], for their extensive welfare states and progressive taxation regime. These social democracies are at the same time liberal democracies.

==Illiberal democracy==
{{main|Illiberal democracy}}

An illiberal democracy is a political system where democratic elections exist, and the government is elected by a democratic majority, but is not restrained from encroaching on the liberty of individuals, or minorities. This may be due to a lack of constitutional limitations on the power of the elected executive, or violations of the existing legal limitations. The experience in some [[post-Soviet]] states drew attention to the phenomenon, although it is not of recent origin. Some critics of illiberal regimes now suggest that the [[rule of law]] should take precedence over democracy, implying a ''de facto'' Western acceptance of what are called &quot;liberalised autocracies&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Pugwash Online, (2004). [http://www.pugwash.org/reports/rc/me/ME2004/me2004report.htm Prospects for the Peace Process]. Accessed [[February 19]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages of democracy==
Critics of democracy as a form of government allege it has inherent disadvantages, both in practice and by its very nature. Some of which may be shared by some or all other forms of government, while others may be unique to democracy.

===Ethnic and religious conflicts===
Democracy, and especially liberal democracy, necessarily assumes a sense of shared values in the demos, otherwise political legitimacy will fail. In other words, it assumes that the demos is in fact a unit. For historical reasons, many states lack the cultural and ethnic unity of the ideal [[nation-state]]. There may be sharp ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. In fact, some groups may be actively hostile to each other. A democracy, which by definition allows mass participation in decision-making, by definition, also allows the use of the political process against the 'enemy'. That is especially visible during [[democratisation]], if a previous non-democratic government suppressed internal rivalry. However, it is also visible in established democracies, in the form of anti-immigrant [[populism]].            

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[democratisation]] of Soviet bloc states led to wars and [[civil war]] in the former [[Yugoslavia]], in the [[Caucasus]], and in [[Moldova]]; wars have also continued in Africa and other parts of the [[Third World]]. Nevertheless, statistical research shows that the fall of [[Communism]] and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s &lt;ref&gt;Center for Systemic Peace, (2006). [http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm Global Conflict Trends - Measuring Systematic Peace]. Accessed [[February 19]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Bureaucracy===
A persistent [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity, and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws. This is seen as pernicious in several ways. New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties. Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding. This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power. The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal [[natural law]] - although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates.

Democracies are also criticised for a claimed slowness and complexity of their decision-making.

===Short-term focus===
Modern liberal democracies, by definition, allow for regular changes of government. That has led to a common criticism of their short-term focus. In four or five years the government will face a new election, and it must think of how it will win that election. That would encourage a preference for policies that will bring short term benefits to the electorate (or to self-interested politicians) before the next election, rather than unpopular policy with longer term benefits. This criticism assumes that it is possible to make long term predictions for a society, something [[Karl Popper]] has criticized as [[historicism]].

Besides the regular review of governing entities, short-term focus in a democracy could also be the result of collective short-term thinking. For example, consider a campaign for policies aimed at reducing environmental damage while causing temporary increase in unemployment. However, this risk applies also to other political systems.

=== Public choice theory===
[[Public choice theory]] is a branch of [[economics]] that studies the decision-making behavior of voters, politicians and government officials from the perspective of economic theory. One studied problem is that each voter has little influence and may therefore have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding political issues. This may allow [[special interest]] groups to gain [[subsidy|subsidies]] and regulations beneficial to them but harmful to society.

===Plutocracy===
The cost of political campaigning in representative democracies may mean that the system favours the rich, a form of [[plutocracy]] who may be a very small minority of the voters. In Athenian democracy, some public offices were [[random]]ly allocated to citizens, in order to inhibit the effects of plutocracy. Modern democracy may also be regarded as a dishonest farce used to keep the masses from getting restless, or a [[conspiracy]] for making them restless for some political agenda. It may encourage candidates to make deals with wealthy supporters, offering favorable legislation if the candidate is elected - perpetuating [[conspiracy|conspiracies]] for [[monopoly|monopolization]] of key areas. However, United States economist [[Steven Levitt]] claims in his book [[Freakonomics]], that campaign spending is no guarantee of electoral success. He compared electoral success of the same pair of candidates running against one another repeatedly for the same job, as often happens in United States Congressional elections, where spending levels varied. He concludes:

:&quot;A winning candidate can cut his spending in half and lose only 1 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, a losing candidate who doubles his spending can expect to shift the vote in his favor by only that same 1 percent.&quot;

Ownership of the media by the few may lead to more specific distortion of the electoral process, since the media are themselves a vital element of that process. Some critics argue that criticism of the [[status quo]] or a particular agenda tends to be suppressed by such media cartels, to protect their own self-interests. Proponents respond that constitutionally protected [[freedom of speech]] makes it possible for both for-profit and non-profit organizations to debate the issues. They argue that media coverage in democracies simply reflects public preferences, and does not entail censorship.

===Majoritarianism===
{{main|majoritarianism}}

[[Thomas Jefferson]] is quoted to have said: &quot;A democracy is nothing more than [[mob rule]], where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine.&quot; Probably the most quoted criticism of democracy is the fear that it is &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. The expression was coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his book, [[Democracy in America]], written in 1831. However the phrase is more popularly attributed to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s [[On Liberty]], written in 1859 &amp;mdash;not then referring to democratic government, but to social [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]]. However, the issue of majority dominance was not unknown to ancient Greek democracies. It is independent of [[universal suffrage]], but it implies a broad [[Suffrage|franchise]], otherwise there would be conflicting minorities. It can apply in both [[direct democracy]] or [[representative democracy]]. &quot;Tyranny of the majority&quot; implies that a government reflecting the majority view can take action that oppresses a particular minority. Typically, this majority is really only a relative majority of the voters and therefore only a minority. It may therefore be argued that one minority tyrannizes another minority in the name of the majority. This politically active and dominant group might decide that a certain minority, such as a religion, political belief, or those with minority views, should be criminalised, either directly or indirectly. This undermines the idea of democracy as an empowerment of the electorate as a whole.

Possible examples include:
*several European countries have introduced bans on personal religious symbols. This ban is perceived by some to be aimed at those considered symbolic of [[Islamism]] - the [[hijab]] or 'Islamic headscarf', the [[burqa]], the [[niqaab]]. In France, they are banned in public schools under the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols]]. Opponents see this as a violation of rights to freedom of religion.
*prohibition of [[pornography]] is typically determined by what the majority is prepared to accept. In the [[United States]] distribution of pornography is declared illegal if the material violates &quot;[[community standards]]&quot; of decency.
*the law on [[abortion]] is typically determined by the religious attitudes of the majority. For &quot;[[pro-life]]&quot; (anti-abortion) activists, unborn children are an oppressed, helpless and disenfranchised minority, and a ban on abortion is a proper use of state power.
*[[recreational drug use]] is also typically legalised (or at least tolerated) to the degree that the majority finds acceptable. Users may see themselves as an oppressed minority, victims of unjustifiable [[War on Drugs|criminalisation]]. 
*society's treatment of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] is also cited in this context. Homosexual acts were widely criminalised in democracies until several decades ago; in some democracies they still are, reflecting the religious or sexual mores of the majority.
*[[Slavery]] of a particular race or ethnicity can occur as a result of majority rule if the majority is of a unified race.
*in the United States, the [[conscription|draft]] early in the [[Vietnam War]] was criticised as oppression of a disenfranchised minority, 18 to 21 year olds. In response to this, the draft age was raised to 19 and the voting age was lowered nationwide (along with the drinking age in many states). While no longer disenfranchised, those subject to the draft remained significantly outnumbered.
*the majority often taxes the minority who are wealthy at [[progressive tax|progressively higher rates]], with the intention that the wealthy will incur a larger tax burden for social purposes. However, this is generally offset to some degree, by their better access to relevant expert advice (tax consultants and lawyers).
*in prosperous western democracies, the poor form a minority of the population, and may be disadvantaged by a majority who resent transfer taxation. Especially when they form a distinct [[underclass]], the majority may use the democratic process to, in effect, withdraw the protection of the [[state]]. 
*classical Athenian democracy executed [[Socrates]] for [[impiety]], i.e., for [[dissent]], although the relevance of this example to contemporary democracy is itself a matter of dispute.
*An often quoted example of the 'tyranny of the majority' is that [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power by legitimate democratic procedures. The [[Nazi]] party gained the largest share of votes in the democratic [[Weimar republic]] in [[1933]]. Some might consider this an example of &quot;tyranny of a minority&quot; since he never gained a majority vote, but it is common for a [[plurality]] to exercise power in democracies, so the rise of Hitler can not be considered irrelevant. However, his regime's large-scale human rights violations took place after the democratic system had been abolished. Also, the Weimar constitution in an &quot;emergency&quot; allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election, something not possible in most liberal democracies.

Proponents of democracy make a number of defences concerning 'tyranny of the majority'. One is to argue that the presence of a [[constitution]] in many democratic countries acts as a safeguard. Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a [[supermajority]] of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or, sometimes, a [[referendum]]. These requirements are often combined. The [[separation of powers]] into [[legislative branch]], [[executive branch]], [[judicial branch]] also makes it more difficult for a small majority to impose their will. This means a majority can still legitimately coerce a minority (which is still ethically questionable), but such a minority would be very small and, as a practical matter, it is harder to get a larger proportion of the people to agree to such actions.

Another argument is that majorities and minorities can take a markedly different shape on different issues. People often agree with the majority view on some issues and agree with a minority view on other issues. One's view may also change. Thus, the members of a majority may limit oppression of a minority since they may well in the future themselves be in a minority.

A third common argument is that, despite the risks, majority rule is preferable to other systems, and the tyranny of the majority is in any case an improvement on a tyranny of a minority. Proponents of democracy argue that empirical statistical evidence strongly shows that more democracy leads to less internal violence and [[democide]]. This is sometimes formulated as [[Rummel's Law]], which states that the less democratic freedom a people have, the more likely their rulers are to murder them.

===Political stability===
One argument for democracy is that by creating a system where the public can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis for government, democracy aims at reducing political uncertainty and instability, and assuring citizens that however much they may disagree with present policies, they will be given a regular chance to change those who are in power, or change policies with which they disagree. This is preferable to a system where political change takes place through violence.

Some think that political stability may be considered as excessive when the group in power remains the same for an extended period of time. On the other hand, this is more common in nondemocracies.

===Effective response in wartime===
A pluralist democracy, by definition, implies that power is not concentrated. One criticism is that this could be a disadvantage for a state in [[war]]time, when a fast and unified response is necessary. The legislature usually must give consent before the start of an offensive military operation, although sometimes the executive can do this on its own while keeping the legislature informed. If the democracy is attacked, no consent is usually required for defensive operations. The people may vote against a [[conscription]] army. Monarchies and dictatorships can in theory, act immediately and forcefully.

However, actual research shows that democracies are more likely to win wars than non-democracies. One explanation is attributes this primarily to &quot;the transparency of the polities, and the stability of their preferences, once determined&quot; by which &quot;democracies are better able to cooperate with their partners in the conduct of wars&quot;. Other research attributes this to superior mobilisation of resources, or selection of wars with a high chance of winning.&lt;ref&gt;Ajin Choi, (2004). &quot;Democratic Synergy and Victory in War, 1816–1992&quot;.

===Corruption===
Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[corruption]]: democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption &lt;ref&gt;

===Poverty and famine===
{{npov-section}}
Statistically more democracy correlates with a higher [[GDP]] per capita, a higher score on the [[human development index]] and a lower score on the human poverty index.

However, there is disagreement regarding how much credit the democratic system can take for this. Various theories have been put forth, all of them controversial. One observation is that democracy became widespread only after the [[industrial revolution]] and the introduction of [[capitalism]]. Evidence in [[peer review]]ed statistical studies support the theory that more capitalism, measured for example with one the several [[Index of Economic Freedom|Indices of Economic Freedom]] which has been used in hundreds of studies by independent researchers &lt;ref&gt;Free the World. [http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research], accessed [[February 19]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;, increases [[economic growth]] and that this in turn increases general prosperity, reduces poverty, and causes [[democratization]]. This is a statistical tendency, and there are individual exceptions like [[India]], which is democratic but arguably not prosperous, or [[Brunei]], which has a high GDP but has never been democratic. There are also other studies suggesting that more democracy increases economic freedom although a few find no or even a small negative effect. &lt;ref&gt;Nicclas Bergren, (2002).

Accessed [[February 19]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; One objection might be that nations like [[Sweden]] and [[Canada]] today score just below nations like [[Chile]] and [[Estonia]] on economic freedom but that Sweden and Canada today have a higher GDP per capita. However, this is a misunderstanding, the studies indicate effect on economic growth and thus that future GDP per capita will be higher with higher economic freedom. It should also be noted that Sweden and Canada are among the world's most capitalist nations according to the index, due to factors such as strong [[rule of law]], strong [[property rights]], and few restrictions against [[free trade]]. Critics might argue that the Index of Economic Freedom and other methods used does not measure the degree of capitalism, preferring some other definition. 

It should be noted that [[Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)|correlation is not causation]] - in other words, if two events happen at the same time, for example democracy and lack of famine, that does not mean that one must cause the other. However, such a causation has been established in some studies of the Index of Economic Freedom and democracy, as noted above.

Even if economic growth has caused democratization in the past, it may not do so in the future. Some evidence suggests that savvy autocrats may have learned how to cut the cord between growth and freedom, enjoying the benefits of the former without the risks of the latter. &lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, George W. Downs, (2005). [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050901faessay84507/bruce-bueno-de-mesquita-george-w-downs/development-and-democracy.html &quot;Development and Democracy&quot;].

[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/jod/10.3sen.html &quot;Democracy as a Universal Value&quot;]. ''Journal of Democracy'', 10.3, 3-17. Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes democracies that have not been very prosperous historically, like [[India]], which had its last great famine in  [[1943]] and many other large scale famines before that in the late nineteenth century, all under British rule. However, some others ascribe the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] to the effects of [[World War II]]. The government of India had been becoming progressively more democratic for years. Provincial government had been entirely so since the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act of 1935]].

===Democratic peace theory===
{{main|Democratic peace theory}}

Numerous studies using many different kinds of data, definitions, and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory. The original finding was that liberal democracies have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that democracies have few ''[[Militarized Interstate Disputes]]'' (MIDs) causing less than 1000 battle deaths with one another, that those MIDs that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths, and that democracies have few [[civil wars]].

There are various criticisms of the theory, including specific historic wars and that correlation is not causation.

===Democide===
Research shows that the more democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by government.

In [[mathematics]], '''logical disjunction''' (usual symbol '''or''') is a [[logical operator]] that results in true if either of the operands is true.

==Definition==
In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], a '''disjunction''' is an &quot;or statement&quot;. For example &quot;John skis or Sally swims&quot; is a disjunction.

Note that in everyday language, use of the word &quot;or&quot; can sometimes mean &quot;either, but not both&quot; (e.g., &quot;would you like tea or coffee?&quot;). In logic, this is called an [[Exclusive disjunction|&quot;exclusive disjunction&quot;]] or &quot;exclusive or&quot; (xor).  When used formally, &quot;or&quot; allows for both parts of the or statement (its ''disjuncts'') to be true (&quot;and/or&quot;), therefore &quot;or&quot; is also called ''inclusive disjunction''.{{rf|1|Boole}}

For two inputs A and B, the [[truth table]] of the function is as follows. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
! A !! B !! A or B
|- align=center
| F || F || F
|- align=center
| F || T || T
|- align=center
| T || F || T
|- align=center
| T || T || T
|}

More generally a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more [[literal]]s separated only by ORs. A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction.

==Symbol==
The mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature. In addition to the abbreviation &quot;or&quot;, one may see
*a vee (&quot;&amp;or;&quot;, or ''&amp;amp;#x2228;'') is typically used for disjunction. For example: &quot;''A'' &amp;or; ''B''&quot; is read as &quot;''A'' or ''B''&quot;. Such a disjunction is false if both ''P'' and ''Q'' are false. In all other cases it is true.

All the following are disjunctions:
''A'' &amp;or; ''B''&lt;p&gt;
¬''A'' &amp;or; ''B''&lt;p&gt;
''A'' &amp;or; ¬''B'' &amp;or; ¬''C'' &amp;or; ''D'' &amp;or; ¬''E''&lt;p&gt;
The equivalent notion in set theory is the [[union (set theory)|set-theoretic union]].

==Associativity and Commutativity==
For more than two inputs, ''or'' can be applied to the first two inputs, and then 
the result can be ''or'ed'' with each subsequent input:

:(''A'' or (''B'' or ''C'')) &amp;hArr; ((''A'' or ''B'') or ''C'')

Because or is [[Associativity|associative]], the order of the inputs does not matter: the same result will be obtained regardless of association.

The operator xor is also [[Commutativity|commutative]] and therefore the order of the operands is not important:

:''A'' or ''B''  &amp;hArr; ''B'' or ''A''

==Bitwise operation==
Disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:

* 0 or 0 = 0
* 0 or 1 = 1
* 1 or 0 = 1
* 1 or 1 = 1
* 1010 or 1110 = 1110

Note that in computer science the OR operator can be used to set a [[bit]] to 1 by OR-ing the bit with 1.

== Union ==
The [[union (set theory)|union]] used in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: ''x'' ∈ ''A'' ∪ ''B'' if and only if (''x'' ∈ ''A'') ∨ (''x'' ∈ ''B'').  Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and [[de Morgan's laws]].

==Note==
{{ent|1|Boole}} [[Boole]], closely following analogy with ordinary mathematics, premised, as a necessary condition to the definition of &quot;x + y&quot;, that x and y were mutually exclusive.  [[Jevons]], and practically all mathematical logicians after him, advocated, on various grounds, the definition of &quot;logical addition&quot; in a form which does not necessitate mutual exclusiveness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''disjunctive syllogism''', also known as '''modus tollendo ponens''' (literally: ''mode which, by denying, affirms'') is a [[validity|valid]], simple [[argument form]]:

: P or Q
: Not P
: Therefore, Q

In [[logical operator]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt; p \lor q, &lt;/math&gt;
:¬ &lt;math&gt; p \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash q &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[logical assertion]].

Roughly, we are told that it has to be one or the other that is true; then we are told that it is not the one that is true; so we infer that it has to be the other that is true.  The reason this is called &quot;disjunctive syllogism&quot; is that, first, it is a [[syllogism]]--a three-step argument--and second, it contains a [[disjunction]], which means simply an &quot;or&quot; statement.  &quot;Either P or Q&quot; is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's ''disjuncts''.

Here is an example:
:Either I will choose soup or I will choose salad.
:I will not choose soup.
:Therefore, I will choose salad.

Here is another example:
:Either the Browns win or the Bengals win.
:The Browns do not win.
:Therefore, the Bengals win.

==Inclusive versus exclusive disjunction==

It should be noted with importance that there are two kinds of logical disjunction:

* ''[[logical disjunction|inclusive]]'' means &quot;and/or&quot; where at least one term must be true or they can both be true.
* ''[[xor|exclusive]]'' (&quot;xor&quot;) means one must be true and the other must be false. Both terms cannot be true and both cannot be false.

The popular English language concept of ''or'' is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments.

This argument:
:Either P or Q.
:Not P.
:Therefore, Q.

is valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the ''exclusive'' meaning is the following form valid:

:Either P or Q (exclusive).
:P.
:Therefore, not Q.

With the ''inclusive'' meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument. See [[affirming a disjunct]].

==Related argument forms==

Unlike [[modus ponendo ponens]] and [[modus tollendo tollens]], with which it should not be confused, modus tollendo ponens is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of logical systems, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of [[reductio ad absurdum]] and [[disjunction elimination]].

Modus tollendo ponens should also not be confused with [[modus ponendo tollens]].

A '''definition''' aims to describe or delimit the [[meaning]] of some term (a word or a phrase) by giving a statement of essential [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Characteristic|distinguishing characteristics]] of the [[concept]], [[entity]], or kind of entity, denoted by that term. The concept or (kind of) entity being defined in a definition is called (from [[Latin]]) the ''definiendum''; the expressions or words used to define it are called the ''definiens''. For example, in ''A bachelor is an unmarried man'', the definiendum is ''bachelor'', and the definiens ''unmarried man''. Often, as in this example, the statement takes the form of expressing the equivalence between the definiendum and the definiens.

==Kinds of definition==
A number of different kinds and techniques of definition can be distinguished, including:

*A dictionary definition or [[lexical definition]] reports the meaning of a word or expression as it is normally used, ''usually'' by supplying an (approximately) equivalent expression in which the original word does not occur.  For example, ''bachelor'' might be defined as ''an unmarried man''; and ''fry'' as ''to cook in hot oil''. (Notice the addition of &quot;an&quot; and &quot;to&quot; in each case, so that the defining expression is not perfectly inter-substitutable with the original: You can say ''John is a bachelor'', but not ''John is '''a an''' unmarried man''. This is normal practice, and is done simply for ease of reading.)  With some words, like ''the'' and ''if'', which cannot be effectively paraphrased, dictionaries will often describe their proper use without offering an equivalent expression.

*[[Contextual definition]]  Some words cannot be clearly defined on their own, but it is possible to offer a schema for defining every sentence in which they occur--that is, a way of replacing every sentence containing the expression with another sentence not containing the expression.  Russell's famous [[Theory of Descriptions]] was an attempt (now widely believed to be incorrect) to do this for all [[definite descriptions]]&amp;mdash;expressions of the form ''the (unique) x''.  On Russell's account, any sentence containing (for example) the expression &quot;the present king of France&quot; was to be rearranged like this: ''The present king of France is bald'' means ''There is exactly one thing which is currently a king of France, and that thing is bald''.  Notice that the defined expression, a noun phrase, is replaced by a sentence (''There is . . . France'') '''and''' a noun phrase (''that thing'') which appears in the position of the original.

*An [[intensional definition]] specifies all and only the properties required of something in order that falls under the term defined (its [[necessary condition|necessary]] and [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] conditions).  This, like the following is typically used to characterize ways of specifying [[Set theory|sets]].  For example, ''the set of primes less than 20'', or {x:x is prime and x &lt; 20}, is an intensional definition of a set.

*An [[extensional definition]] lists everything that the defined term actually applies to (its ''extension'').  Like the above, this is often used in charactizing definitions of sets: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19} is an extensional definition of the same set as mentioned there.  Note that extensional definitions cannot be used to specify infinite sets (all the prime numbers, say).  They are also not [[counterfactual]]ly robust: If you &quot;define&quot; dog by making a list of all the dogs, then you will not have any grounds for deciding whether some newly encountered animal would be a dog.

*An [[ostensive definition]] gives the meaning of a term by pointing out the thing denoted by it, or pointing out examples of the kind of thing meant by it.  So you can explain who Jones is by pointing him out to me; or what a dog is by pointing at several and expecting me to &quot;catch on.&quot;

*[[Operational definition]] &quot;of a quantity is a specific process whereby it is measured.&quot;

*A [[theoretical definition]] &quot;gives the meaning of a word in terms of the theories of a specific discipline.&quot;

*A [[definition by genus and difference]] &quot;is one in which a word or concept that indicates a species -- a specific type of item, not necessarily a biological category -- is described first by a broader category, the genus, then distinguished from other items in that category by differentia.&quot;

* A [[recursive definition]] or [[inductive definition]] is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way.  Normally this consists of two (or three) steps: (I) Several specific objects (a &quot;base set&quot;) are stated to fall under the term X being described. (II) All and only the things bearing a certain relation to members of X are also stated to be members of X.  For instance, we could define [[natural number]] as folows: (I) 1 is a natural number.  (II) The successor of a natural number is also a natural number, and nothing else is.  (&quot;Nothing else is&quot;, the closure step, is sometimes considered a separate step.)  For this to work well, the definition in any given case must be well-founded, avoiding a circle or an infinite regress. (See the following.)

*A [[circular definition]] is one that assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined. For instance, we can define &quot;oak&quot; as a tree which has catkins and grows from an acorn, and then define &quot;acorn&quot; as the nut produced by an oak tree. To someone not knowing either which trees are oaks or which nuts are acorns, the definition is usually fairly useless. (see [[tautology]])

*A [[stipulative definition]] is the specification of a meaning adopted or assumed specifically for the purposes of argument or discussion in a given context.  For example, I might want to explain to you how [[beer]] is made, but not be sure whether [[sake]] is a kind of beer nor how it is made.  So I might stipulate at the beginning that ''By 'beer,' I mean only beer brewed from barley.''

*A [[precising definition]] &quot;is a definition that extends the dictionary definition (lexical definition) of a term for a specific purpose by including additional criteria that narrow down the set of things meeting the definition.&quot;

*A [[persuasive definition]] &quot;is a type of definition in which a term is defined in such a way as to be an argument for a particular position (as opposed to a lexical definition, which aims to be neutral to all usages), and is deceptive in that it has the surface form of a dictionary definition.&quot;

== Determining meaning: extension, intension, ambiguity, and vagueness ==
Just as [[logical argument|argument]]s can be good or bad, definitions can be good or bad.  A definition gives us the ''meaning'' of a word.  To understand this more deeply requires an elucidation of a few features of meaning, the principal ones being extension, intension, ambiguity, and vagueness.
*An [[ostensive definition]] points out examples by which one gains a sense of the meaning of a word.
*An [[extensional definition]] exhaustively lists every referent of a word (the completion of an ostensive exploration).
*An [[intensional definition]] gives the properties of the referents of the word under investigation, usually allowing a more compact definition than a complete enumeration.
The distinction between the ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]'' and the ''[[intension]]'' of a word is very similar to the distinction between a word's ''denotation'' and ''connotation''.  For example, the extension of the word &quot;bachelor&quot; would be ''all and only the bachelors in the world''.  The extension of this word would include several hundreds of millions of men.  The ''intension'' of the word is more brief because it includes just two properties: the property of being a ''man'', and the property of being ''unmarried''.  Essentially, all bachelors are unmarried men, and ''only'' bachelors are unmarried men.

The sort of definition that philosophers are interested in, insofar as they are interested in ''definitions'' at all, is one that identifies a word's ''intension'', rather than its ''extension''.  A definition of the word 'bachelor' is 'unmarried man' which could also be specified by a very long list including all unmarried men. Aside from being practically impossible, such a list is not what is generally desired.  What is desired is a description of what all those things we call 'bachelors' have in common that distinguishes them from all non-bachelors.  A list of all bachelors would be static, and could not expand to determine whether any new human is a bachelor or not.

There are two different ways in which the meanings of words can be ''unclear''.  Words can be unclear in the sense of being ''[[ambiguity|ambiguous]]'', of being ''[[vagueness|vague]]'', or a combination of the two.  Most words are, in fact, both ambiguous and vague.  This is not a skeptical or even a controversial claim; to say that many, or perhaps even most, words are both ambiguous ''and'' vague is not to say that they have no meaning.  It is to say, first, that many individual words have many distinct senses; and, second, that those senses are often, in ordinary language, not meant to be exhaustively precise.  A word that is both ambiguous and vague, whose extreme limits are fuzzy and undefined, can still contain a rich fund of meaning.

== A definition of 'definition'==

Suppose we have decided to define a certain word or a concept associated with that word.  Suppose also that we have identified ''which sense'' of the word we are interested in, and we have noted clear cases, some unclear cases, and some borderline cases of the application of the word.  The question then is: how can this word be defined?  What is desired here is a description of the ''intension'' of the word: that is, an account of the set of properties that characterizes all and only members of the extension.  In that case, it seems the following is a serviceable account of the meaning of '(intensional) definition':
:The ''definition'' of a [[concept]], or of (a given sense of) a word or phrase, is a [[description]] of its [[intension]]&amp;mdash;that is, the set of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] that characterizes all and only members of the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of the word; the extension is all the things that the concept, word, or phrase applies to.
Some philosophers have criticisms of this sort of definition of the word ''definition''; or perhaps it would be better to say that some philosophers think that it is, for various reasons, impossible to give exhaustively exact definitions of most concepts, words, and phrases.  Two prominent critics are [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]].  Still most philosophers acknowledge that in philosophy something similar to giving definitions of important philosophical concepts is necessary.

== ''A contribution to defining the term 'definition''' ==

Minimum Intent: The following definition of the term 'definition' is presented as a reference, (a comparator, a norm) that must not be violated when defining scientific terms.
 
Axioms: 

1) ‘Something’ is a term that has a most general meaning, it can mean anything (but it does not automatically include ‘everything’).

2) 'Ambient' is anything in the vicinity of, and, to a certain degree, within something.
 
3) ‘Event’ is something that can be distinguished from its ambient. 

4) ‘Relation’ is something that has, at least, two events. 

5) ‘System’ is something that has at least two relations.

6) ‘Phenomenon’ is a generic term (hypernym) for the above terms,  providing that one or several of  human senses indicate (directly or indirectly, presently or in the past) the existence of a so-termed system, relation, event, ambient, or something else.

7) All other terms used within this theorem - apart from the term “definition” and the terms listed in inverted commas under 1) to 6) above - are already intrinsically known; the understanding of each of these terms is consistent with this treatise. 
 
Theorem: 

&quot;Definition&quot; is a fixed, static form (a model; an appearance of something as distinguished from the substance of which it is made; something autonomous from its own representation) of some relation(s) that significantly increases the probability of realisation of an intended (premeditated) change of some phenomenon. Such a change is to be achieved by an entity that is capable of utilising this definition for such a specified purpose. A definition cannot be generated, or used, without the existence of a system, which is organised and structured above a certain level of chaos. However, once it is generated and recorded, a definition can continue to exist (to be recorded) without the existence of the mentioned entity. A definition should be complemented with a minimum intent statement: a context that delimits a minimum domain of purposes for which it can be used. This statement does not exclude the possibility of using the same definition correctly for some other purpose. However, this extended use must not violate (contradict) an already established meaning; e.g. it must not cause synonymy or homonymy.
 
In addition, a definition must be complemented with axioms, with one or more examples, and, when needed and possible, with figures and animated representations.

Definitions are the bits necessary to construct and communicate knowledge. A definition is built up of structural components: pieces of information. Information is conveyed by means of signals of various kinds; the most frequently used include figures and terms. Although terms can be transferred by means of figures, they can also be transferred by means of sounds which are registered by the hearing senses. It is worth noting that information media can be mutually translated, e.g. visual info can be translated into information received by tactile or hearing senses. A history of the media used to record information reveals a variety of options. Alphabetic writing (in which consonant and vowel sounds are presented by letters or other symbols such as Braille characters and Morse code) is the most widespread system, but it is not the earliest, nor is it the only one. Writing has evolved from an extension of pictures that iconically represented some thing or action and then the word that bore that meaning. This approach led to so-called character script, such as that of Chinese, in which each word is represented by a separate symbol. 
 
Contemporary definitions rely heavily on textual formulations, but figures are also very efficient at conveying comprehensive information; many sciences (e.g. mathematics, chemistry) have accepted ideograms to convey sophisticated notions. The optimal solution is an appropriate combination of text, figures, animation and sound.

The following definition is presented to provide an example of a definition:

“Figure”: (n) an arrangement of points made within two-dimensional space to present a visual static impression (a perception) of something (e.g., a figure printed on a book page, showing the front view of a home).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Disruption''' generally refers to the normal workings of something being interrupted. 

*In [[Scotland]], the '''[[Disruption of 1843]]''' refers to the divergence from the [[Church of Scotland]] of the [[Free Church of Scotland]]
*'''[[Dismemberment|Disruption]]''' as a method of [[execution (legal)|execution]] consists of tying each leg of the victim to [[horse]]s or other animals, to two [[winch]]es or other pulling machines, such as the [[rack]], or to two small trees that have been bent down to the ground and then releasing the trees to spring up or pulling simultaneously with the animals or machines so that the body of the execution victim is pulled apart. One celebrated victim of such an execution was Queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], who, on her nephew's orders, was subjected to horrific extension on the rack for three days, before suffering final dismemberment between four horses.

*In [[Korea]], during the periods of 12th and 18th century, there was a form of punishment that was called &quot;Neung Ji Cheo Cham&quot; that would involve four hooved animals (ox, horse), and a criminal. The victim's legs and arms would each be tied to the four animals separately, and on one instance, all animals would be commanded or whipped to run in opposite directions, thereby literally 'tearing' the victims body in 5 pieces (two legs, two arms and the torso)

*[[Information security]] specialists also may refer to a disaster as a '''disruption''' when an event interrupts normal business or technical processes.
*[[Disruption (of adoption)|Disruption]] is also the term for the cancellation of an [[adoption]] of a child before it is legally completed. In common usage, though, it refers also to the legal procedure for ending an adoption already completed, which is technically known as [[dissolution]].
*Disruption is a method of disabling an explosive device by shooting it with water at high velocity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{disco}}

'''Disco''' is a genre of music that originated in [[discothèque]]s.  Generally the term refers to a specific style of music and [[dance]]. 

==Origins==
[[Image:Discofeverstamp.jpg|right|200px]]
As with all such musical genres, defining a single point of disco's development is difficult, as many elements of disco music appear on earlier records (such as the [[1971]] theme from the film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' by [[Isaac Hayes]]) (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). In general it can be said that first true disco songs were released in [[1973]], however, many consider [[Manu Dibango]]'s 1972 ''Soul Makossa'' the first disco record (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). Initially, most disco songs catered to a nightclub/[[dancing]] audience only, rather than general audiences such as [[radio]] listeners, but there are many aspects proving opposite tendencies as well; popular radio-hits were being played in discothèques, as long as they had an easy to follow rhythmic base-pattern close to 120 BPM (beats per minute).

Musical influences include [[funk]], [[soul music]], and [[salsa (music)|salsa]] and the Latin or Hispanic musics which influenced salsa.

Soul and funk records that influenced disco include:

*[[Sly and the Family Stone]] - &quot;[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]&quot; (1968), &quot;[[Everyday People]]&quot; (1968) (Jones and Kantonen, 1999), &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1971)
*[[Hugh Masekela]] - &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; (1968)
*[[Honey Cone]] - &quot;Want Ads&quot; (1971), &quot;Stick Up&quot; (1971)
*[[Isaac Hayes]] - &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971)
*[[Incredible Bongo Band]] - &quot;Bongo Rock&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Eumir Deodato]] - &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; (1973)
*[[Average White Band]] - &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot; (1974), &quot;Cut the Cake&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] - &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine&quot; (1970), &quot;Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved&quot; (1971), &quot;Get Up Off of That Thing&quot; (1975) (ibid)

The [[Motown Sound]] also featured many elements that would be associated with the disco sound:
*[[Martha &amp; The Vandellas]] &quot;Dancing In The Street&quot; (1963) 
*[[The Supremes]] - &quot;[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]&quot; (1966), &quot;Reflections&quot; (1967)
*[[Jackson 5]] - &quot;[[I Want You Back]]&quot;, &quot;[[ABC (song)|ABC]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Love You Save]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mama's Pearl]]&quot; (1969-71)
*[[Stevie Wonder]] - &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot; (1969), &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours&quot; (1970), &quot;Superstition&quot; (1972), &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Diana Ross]] - &quot;[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]&quot; (1970)

[[Philadelphia International Records]] defined [[Philly soul]] and helped define disco (ibid) with records such as:
*[[The Three Degrees]] - &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The Intruders]] - &quot;I'll Always Love My Mama&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The O'Jays]] - &quot;Love Train&quot; (1972), &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; (1974), &quot;I Love Music&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[MFSB]] - &quot;[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]&quot; (1973), &quot;Love is the Message&quot; (1973) (ibid)

Pre-/Early-disco [[TK Records]] tracks:
*[[Betty Wright]] - &quot;Clean Up Woman&quot; (1972) (ibid)
*[[George McCrae]]- &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[KC and the Sunshine Band]] - &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot; (1975), &quot;That's the Way (I Like It)&quot; (1975), &quot;(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot; (1976) (ibid)

Early-disco hits include:
*[[Nelson James]] - &quot;I Have An Afro&quot; (1972) (ibid)
*[[Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes]] - &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[Love Unlimited Orchestra]] - &quot;Love's Theme&quot; (1973) (ibid)
*[[The Jackson 5]]- &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[Barry White]] - &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More, Baby&quot; (1973), &quot;Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot; (1974), &quot;You're the First, the Last, My Everything&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[Shirley and Co.]] - &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot;  (1975) (ibid)
*[[Hues Corporation]] - &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[The Commodores]] - &quot;Machine Gun&quot; (1974) (ibid)
*[[Frankie Valli]] - &quot;Swearin' To God (1974)
*[[Dalida]]- &quot;J'Attendrai&quot; (the first French disco song and first hit in Europe) (1975) (ibid)
*[[LaBelle]] - &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[The Four Seasons]] - &quot;Who Loves You&quot; and &quot;December '63 (Oh What A Night!)&quot; (1975) (ibid)
*[[Silver Convention]] - &quot;Fly Robin Fly&quot; (1975), &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot; (1976) (ibid)
*[[Andrea True Connection]]- &quot;More More More&quot; (1976) (ibid)

==Popularity==
[[1975]] was the year when disco really took off, with hit songs like [[Van McCoy]]'s &quot;[[The Hustle]]&quot; and [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; reaching the mainstream. 1975 also marked the release of the first [[disco mix]] on album, the A side of [[Gloria Gaynor]]'s ''Never Can Say Goodbye'' (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). Disco's popularity peaked in the so-called Disco era of [[1977]] - [[1980]], driven in part by the [[1977]] classic film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.  Disco also gave rise to an increased popularity of [[Line dance|line dancing]] and other partly pre-choreographed dances; many line dances can be seen in films such as ''Saturday Night Fever'', which also features the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]].

In [[1975]], the pop star [[Dalida]] was the first to make disco music in France with her song &quot;J'attendrai&quot; which was a big hit there as well as in Canada and Japan in [[1976]]. She also released many other disco hits between [[1975]] and [[1981]], including &quot;Monday, Tuesday... Laissez-moi danser&quot; in [[1979]], translated the same year as &quot;Let Me Dance Tonight&quot; for the USA, where she was their &quot;French diva&quot; since her late-[[1978]] performance at the [[Carnegie Hall]]). Soon after [[Dalida]]'s pioneering French disco work, other French artists recorded disco: [[Claude François]], in [[1976]] with his song &quot;Cette année-là&quot; (a cover of [[The Four Seasons]]' disco hit &quot;December 1963 (Oh what a night)&quot;), then the famous &quot;yé-yé&quot; French pop singer [[Sheila]], with her group [[B. Devotion]], who even had a hit in the USA (a rarity for French artists) with the song &quot;Spacer&quot; in [[1979]]. Many other European artists also recorded disco music.

==Popular disco artists==
[[Image:Saturday night fever.jpg|thumb|left|Saturday Night Fever]]
The most popular disco artists of the 1970s include [[The Bee Gees]], [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]],  [[Cerrone]], [[ABBA]], [[Chic]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[The Jacksons]], [[Claudja Barry]], [[Linda Clifford]], [[Teri DeSario]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Carol Williams]], [[Sylvester James|Sylvester]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Boney M]], [[Village People]], [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]], [[Vicki Sue Robinson]], [[MFSB]], [[Loleatta Holloway]], [[France Joli]], [[Evelyn King|Evelyn 'Champagne' King]], [[Yvonne Elliman]], [[Tavares (music group)|Tavares]], [[Salsoul Orchestra]], [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[The Emotions]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Cheryl Lynn]], [[The Trammps]], [[Love and Kisses]], [[Barry White]], [[Silver Convention]], [[Kool &amp; the Gang]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Dalida]], and [[Machine (disco artist)]]. However, many disco fans would agree that, &quot;for every chart hit pounded into the public's consciousness, fifty far superior tracks from all over the world were being played at some hard-to-find basement club&quot; (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). There appeared many non-disco artists, which included [[The Eagles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Cher (entertainer)|Cher]], [[Barry Manilow]],  [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Leif Garrett]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Elton John]], [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Prince]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (with the bass guitar riffs emulating those of Chic in their hit ''[[Another One Bites The Dust]]''), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Bryan Adams]], as well as veteran entertainers such as [[Paul Anka]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Charo]], [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Andy Williams]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].

Many disco novelty songs sold well and were popular. [[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded what is considered to be one of the most popular parodies of all time, ''[[Disco Duck]]''.

==DJs and producers==
Disco music diverged from the [[rock (music)|rock]] of the [[1960s]], elevating music from the raw sound of 4-piece [[garage bands]] to refined music composed by producers who contracted local [[symphony]] and [[philharmonic]] [[orchestras]] and session musicians. For the first time in three decades, orchestral music became the preeminent sound in the popular-music scene. Top disco music producers included [[Patrick Adams]], [[Biddu]], [[Cerrone]], [[Alec R. Costandinos]], [[John Davis]], [[Gregg Diamond]], [[Kenneth Gamble]], [[Norman Harris]], [[Leon Huff]], [[Sylvester Levay]], [[Ian Levine]], [[Mike Lewis]], [[Van McCoy]], [[Meco Monardo]], [[Tom Moulton]], [[Boris Midney]], [[Vincent Montana Jr]], [[Randy Muller]], [[Freddie Perren]], [[Laurin Rinder]], [[Richie Rome]], [[Warren Schatz]], [[Harold Wheeler]], and [[Michael Zager]], whose roles involved every aspect of production, from composing the arrangements to conducting the 50- to 100-member orchestras from [[Los_Angeles (orchestra)|Los Angeles]] to [[New_York (orchestra)|New York]], from [[Chicago (orchestra)|Chicago]] to [[Philadelphia (orchestra)|Philadelphia]], from [[Detroit (orchestra)|Detroit]] to [[Miami (orchestra)|Miami]], from [[London (orchestra)|London]] to [[Berlin (orchestra)|Berlin]], from [[Vancouver (orchestra)|Vancouver]] to [[Montreal (orchestra)|Montreal]], from to [[Paris (orchestra)|Paris]] to [[Milan (orchestra)|Milan]].

With as many as 64 [[sound_recording|track]]s of vocals and instruments to be compiled into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with [[orchestral build]]s and [[break (music)|break]]s, the mixing engineers became an important fixture in the production process, and, as a result, were most influential in developing the &quot;sound&quot; of the recording through the [[disco mix]]. Record sales were often dependent on, though not guaranteed by, floor play in clubs. Notable DJs include [[Jim Burgess]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez]], [[Rick Gianatos]], [[Francis Grasso]] (Sanctuary), [[Larry Levan]] (Paradise Garage), [[Ian Levine]] (Heaven), John Luongo, and [[David Mancuso]] (The Loft).

==Instrumentation==
Instruments commonly used by disco musicians included the rhythm [[guitar]] (most often played in &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; style, usually through a [[wah-wah]] or [[phaser]]), [[bass guitar|bass]], [[piano]] and electroacoustic keyboards (most important: the [[Fender-Rhodes]] and [[Wurlitzer]] electric pianos and the [[Hohner Clavinet]]), [[harp]], [[synthesizer|string synth]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[Horn (instrument)|French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[piccolo]], and [[drums]], [[timpani]], as well a [[drum kit]].  [[Electronic drum]]s were making a debut during this era, with Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]] appearing as pioneers in electronic percussion.  Most disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat (sometimes using a 16-beat pattern on the [[hi-hat]] cymbal, or an eight-beat pattern with an open hi-hat on the &quot;off&quot; beat) and a heavy, syncopated bassline. 

In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass hits &quot;[[four to the floor]]&quot;, at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four. (Michaels, 1990) Disco is further characterized by a sixteenth note division of the quarter notes established by the bass as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern:

[[Image:Characteristic rock and disco drum patterns.PNG|550px|Characteristic rock and disco drum patterns]]

This sixteenth note pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar (lead guitar parts are rare), and may be implied rather than explicitly present, often involving [[syncopation]]. As a simpler example, bass lines often use the following rhythm:

[[Image:Characteristic disco bass rhythm.PNG|550px|Characteristic disco bass rhythm]]

The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on strings and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, a &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; results. There are however more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by [[Chic]].

==Format==
At first, [[single (music)|singles]] were released on 7-inch [[45 (number)|45]]-[[rpm]] records, 45s, which were shorter in length and of poorer sound quality than [[12-inch single]]s. [[Motown Records]] was the first to market these through their &quot;Eye-Cue&quot; label, but these and other 12-inch singles were the length of the original 45s until Scepter/Wand released the first 12-inch extended-version single in 1976: [[Jesse Green]]'s &quot;Nice and Slow&quot; b/w [[Sweet Music]]'s &quot;I Get Lifted&quot; (engineered by [[Tom Moulton]]). The single was packaged in collectable picture sleeves, a relatively new concept at the time. 12-Inch singles became commercially available after the first crossover, [[Tavares (music group)|Tavares]]' &quot;Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel.&quot; 12-Inch singles allowed longer dance time and [[musical form|formal]] possibilities. (Jones and Kantonen, 1999)

==Backlash in U.S. and UK==

The popularity of the film ''Saturday Night Fever'' prompted the major record labels to mass-produce hits, however, as some perceived, turning the genre from something vital and edgy into a safe &quot;product&quot; homogenized for the mass audience. Though disco music had several years of popularity, an American anti-disco sentiment was festering, marked by an impatient return to rock (loudly encouraged by worried rock radio stations). Disco music and dancing fads were depicted as not only silly (witness [[Frank Zappa]]'s satirical song [[Sheik Yerbouti|&quot;Dancin' Fool&quot;]]), but [[effeminate]]. 

In Britain, however, during the same year as the first American anti-disco demonstration (see [[Disco#Rock vs. Disco|below]]), ''The Young Nationalist'' publication of the [[far-right]] [[British National Party]] reported that &quot;disco and its melting pot pseudo-philosophy must be fought or Britain's streets will be full of black-worshipping soul boys,&quot; though this had been true for twenty years with many white male English teens considering themselves &quot;soul freaks&quot;. The emergence of the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[goth]] scenes contributed to disco's decline.

===Rock versus disco===
Strong disapproval of disco among some rock fans existed throughout the disco era, growing as disco's influence grew, such that the expression &quot;Disco Sucks&quot; was common by the late-1970s among these fans. 

In [[1979]], Chicago rock deejays [[Steve Dahl]] and [[Garry Meier]] along with [[Michael Veeck]] (son of legendary sports marketer [[Bill Veeck]]) staged a promotional event with an anti-disco theme, ''[[Disco Demolition Night]]'', between games at a [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] doubleheader. The event involved exploding disco records, and ended in a near-riot. The second game of the doubleheader had to be forfeited.

White male rock fans who spoke out against the music were sometimes accused of prejudice for objecting to a musical idiom that was strongly associated with both black and homosexual audiences. To further complicate matters, several prominent, popular rock artists recorded songs with audible debts to disco, sometimes to strong critical and commercial response. [[David Bowie]]'s &quot;Golden Years,&quot; and [[The Rolling Stones]]' &quot;Miss You&quot; and &quot;Emotional Rescue,&quot; are distinguished examples of these disco-rock fusions, and artists such as [[The Who]], [[Rod Stewart]], and to a lesser extent [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[The Clash]] also recorded disco-informed songs. Since the advent of disco and dance music in general, many have argued that more and more rock music has absorbed the rhythmic sensibilities of dance.

==Time of transition== 

The year 1980 was a transitional time for music, especially dance music, which lost its ''disco sound'', as complex melodic structures and plush elements of the symphony orchestra gave way to a diminutive, ''street'' sound.  In the early-[[1980s]], [[George Benson]], [[Rick James]], [[Patrice Rushen]], [[The Brothers Johnson]], [[The Weather Girls]], [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]], [[Kool &amp; the Gang]], [[Miquel Brown]], [[Teena Marie]], [[The Commodores]], [[The S.O.S. Band]], and other artists continued to create many ''disco-influenced'' dance hits. At the same time new styles emerged  - [[Italo Disco]] and [[Euro Disco]]. 

The gradual change that occurred in the late-1970s pop-disco sound can be evidenced in such titles as 
*[[Donna Summers]]' ''I Feel Love'' (1977) and ''Hot Stuff'' (1978)
*[[Rod Stewart]]'s ''Do You Think I'm Sexy''(1978)
*[[Amii Stewart]]'s ''Knock On Wood'' (1979) 
*[[The Bee Gees]]' ''Tragedy'' (1979) 
*[[Blondie]]'s ''Heart of Glass'' (1979) 
which foreboded the events of the next decade.  Faster tempos and synthesized affects during the early-1980s dance sound, accompanied by simplified backgrounds and rock guitars, directed ''dance music'' toward the ''pop-rock'' genre.  Songs such as 
*[[Olivia Newton-John]]'s ''Xanadu'' (1980) 
*Lime's ''Your Love'' (1981) 
*Boystown Gang's ''Can't Take My Eyes off of You'' (1981) 
*Roni Griffith's ''(The Best Part of) Breaking Up'' (1981) 
*Patrick Cowley's ''Do You Wanna Funk'' (1982) 
*[[The Pointer Sisters]]' ''Jump'' (1982) 
*[[The Weather Girls]]' ''It's Raining Men'' (1982) 
exemplified the emerging dance-music form that dropped the complicated melodic structures of the ''disco style'', as woodwinds, horns, and strings were replaced by synthesizers, which mimicked their sound.  Here, one can readily experience the drastic changes, from the musical arrangements - missing all signs of [[symphony]]-[[orchestration]], including [[Orchestral_build|orchestral builds]] and [[breaks]] - to the [[melody]] - missing all signs of the complicated structures of the typical disco sound, including multiple [[musical_bridge|bridges]] and fanciful [[refrains]].

==Regional styles of disco==
Main article: ''[[disco orchestration]]''

As with many forms of art, music contains many ''types'', of which there are distinct ''[[genres]]'', and within which there are various ''[[styles]]''.  The sound of a disco song, as with the sound of a song of any genre of music, depended on the particular tastes of the artists, and the arrangers, producers, and even the orchestra conductors and [[concertmasters]] dictating the type of stylized playing method of each [[section]] of the [[orchestra]], down to the [[engineers]] and [[mixers]] who assembled all the elements to make a fluid, cohesive ''sculpture of sound'' through melodic continuity.  Even without a very knowledgeable ''ear'' for music, one can distinguish the stylings of Van McCoy's ''The Hustle'' (1976) from those of Silver Convention's ''Get Up and Boogie'' (1976), and from those of Chic's ''Good Times''(1978), and Sister sledge's ''We Are Family''(1978). 

As such, many ''regional sounds'' of ''disco'' developed during the mid-1970s, as a result of collaborative efforts of many individuals with a legacy of formal education and training in music theory and orchestration, whose educational backgrounds laid the foundation for the musical genre that was to burst forth onto the ''dance-music scene'' into what would come to be regarded as ''designer music''.  It can be noted that many of the [[Conducting|conductors]] and [[Orchestra|players]] of the large city symphony and philharmonic orchestras responsible for the grand productions of ''disco'' were seasoned veterans of orchestras throughout the country, some even going back to the ''[[Big_band|big-band era]]''.

Some of the different regional sounds include:
* [[Philadelphia_(orchestra)|The Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra]] as heard by groups such as [[MFSB]], [[The Three Degrees]], [[The Ritchie Family]]. 

* [[New_York_(orchestra)|The New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] was the foundation of the '''New York Sound''', which included
** [[Van McCoy]] ''The Hustle'', 
** [[Odyssey]]'s ''Native New Yorker'' (1977), 
** [[Gerri Granger]]'s ''Can't Take My Eyes off of You'' (1976) 
** [[Vicki Sue Robinson]]'s ''Turn the Beat Around'' (1976), 
** [[Roberta Flack]]'s ''Back Together Again'' (1979), 

* [[Los_Angeles_(orchestra)|The Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra]] was the foundation of the '''Los Angeles Sound''', which included:
** [[Carrie Lucas]]'s ''Dance with Me'' (1979), 
** [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]]'s ''My Sweet Summer Suite'' (1976), 
** [[Tavares]]' ''Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel'' (1976) 
** [[Phyllis Hyman]]'s ''You Know How to Love Me'' (1979),
** [[High Inergy]]'s ''Shoulda Gone Dancing'' (1979)

==Transition from the ''disco sound'' of the 1970s to the ''dance sound'' of the 1980s==

The transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles can be illustrated best by analysis of the work of specific artists, arrangers, and producers within each region, respective to the timeperiods. Complex musical structurres basically gave way to a &quot;one-man-band&quot; sound produced on synthesizer keyboards. Also, the increased addition of a slightly different harmonic structure, with elements borrowed from Blues and Jazz, (such as more prominent chords created with acoustic or electric pianos) created a different style of &quot;dance music&quot; in the 1981-83 period. But by this time, the word &quot;disco&quot; became associated with anything danceable, that played in discothèques, so the music continued for a time to be called &quot;disco&quot; by many. Examples include D. Train, Kashif, and Patrice Rushen. Both changes was influenced by some of the great R &amp; B and jazz musicians of the 70's, such as Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock, who had pioneered and perfected &quot;one-man-band&quot; type keyboard techniques.

==Disco &quot;spinoffs&quot; rap and &quot;house&quot; music==

Finally, disco was largely succeeded for younger listeners by rap, which had started, by rapping over disco tracks. The first commercially popular rap hit was &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot;, which borrowed the bass line from Chic's &quot;Good Times&quot;. The two styles existed side by side for a few years, with rap sometimes being used in disco songs such as In Deep's &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&quot;. The two styles together also sparked off &quot;House Music&quot; or &quot;techno&quot; when Afrika Bambataa released the 1982 rap &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, which drew several elements from Kraftwerk's &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; and the previous year's &quot;Numbers&quot;. Electronic sounds in rap were eventually discarded in favor of a more &quot;raw&quot; hip-hop sound. However, the &quot;Planet Rock&quot; sound also spawned a non-&quot;hip-hop&quot; electronic dance trend, with such follow-ups as Planet Patrol's &quot;Play At Your own Risk&quot;, the same year, followed by &quot;One More Shot&quot; by C-Bank; and the following year, its popularity skyrocketed with Shannon's &quot;Let The Music Play&quot; Freeze's &quot;AEIOU&quot;, and Midnight Star's &quot;Freakazoid&quot;. Electronic Dance music or House Music (later called &quot;techno&quot;) had now emerged as its own genre, and this became the new &quot;disco&quot;, even though it was not addressed as such.

==&quot;Retro&quot; revival==
In the [[1990s]], a revival of the original disco style began and is exemplified by such songs as &quot;Lemon&quot; by [[U2]] (1993), &quot;Spend Some Time&quot; by [[Brand New Heavies]] (1994), &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; by [[Jamiroquai]] (1996), &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot; by [[The Spice Girls]] (1997), and &quot;Strong Enough&quot; by [[Cher (entertainer)|Cher]] (1998) (who had also released disco songs in the seventies).

During the first half of the [[2000s]], there were releases by a number of artists including &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; by [[Kylie Minogue]] (2001), &quot;I Don't Understand It&quot; by [[Ultra Nate]] (2001), &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot; by [[Alcazar]]    
(2001), &quot;Love Foolosophy&quot; by [[Jamiroquai]] (2001), &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; by [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] (2001), and &quot;Love Invincible&quot; by [[Michael Franti and Spearhead]] (2003) that channeled classic disco music.

Most recently, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has used disco themes in her latest album, ''[[Confessions on a Dancefloor|Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Her single &quot;[[Hung Up]]&quot;, notably samples ABBA's &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;.

==Radio==
Currently, most radio stations that play dance music or '70s-era music will play this music and related forms such as [[funk]] and [[Philadelphia soul]] at some point in their playlists; both major satellite radio companies also have disco music stations in their lineup. However, dance music stations in general are not known for having high ratings.

The '''Danube''' ({{lang-de|Donau}}, [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Dunaj'', {{lang-hu|Duna}}, [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Dunav'',  [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Дунав''/''Dunav'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''Дунав'', {{lang-ro|Dunăre}}, {{lang-uk|Дунай/Dunay}}, [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Danuvius''', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Tuna'') is [[Europe]]'s second-longest [[river]] (after the [[Volga River|Volga]]).

It rises in the [[Black Forest]] in [[Germany]] as two smaller rivers &amp;ndash; the [[Brigach]] and the [[Breg]] &amp;ndash; which join at [[Donaueschingen]], and it is from here that it is known as the Danube, flowing south-eastwards for a distance of some 2850 km (1771 miles) before emptying into the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Danube Delta]] in [[Romania]].

The Danube has been an important international waterway for centuries, as it remains today. Known to history as one of the long-standing frontiers of the [[Roman Empire]], the river flows through &amp;ndash; or forms a part of the borders of &amp;ndash; ten countries: [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].

The Danube flows through the following large cities:

*[[Ulm]] - [[Germany]]
*[[Ingolstadt]] - [[Germany]]
*[[Regensburg]] - [[Germany]], capital of [[Upper Palatinate]]
*[[Passau]] - [[Germany]]
*[[Linz]] - [[Austria]], capital of [[Upper Austria]]
*[[Krems]] - [[Austria]]
*[[Vienna]] - capital of [[Austria]], where the Danube floodplain is called the [[Lobau]]
*[[Bratislava]] - capital of [[Slovakia]]
*[[Budapest]] - capital of [[Hungary]]
*[[Vukovar]] - [[Croatia]]
*[[Novi Sad]] - capital of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Serbian-Montenegrin]] province of [[Vojvodina]]
*[[Belgrade]] - the capital of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]
*[[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] - [[Romania]]
*[[Vidin]] - [[Bulgaria]]
*[[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] - Bulgaria
*[[Brăila]] - [[Romania]]
*[[Galaţi]] - [[Romania]]
*[[Tulcea]] - [[Romania]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==Tributaries==
The Danube's tributary rivers reach into seven other countries. Some Danubian tributaries are important rivers in their own right, navigable by barges and river boats of shallow draught. Ordered from source to mouth, the main tributaries are:
:[[Iller]] - [[Lech River|Lech]] - [[Regen River|Regen]] (entering at [[Regensburg]]) - [[Isar]] - [[Inn River|Inn]] (entering at [[Passau]]) - [[Enns River|Enns]] - [[Morava River, Central Europe|Morava]] - [[Leitha]] - [[Váh]] (entering at [[Komárno]]) - [[Hron]] - [[Ipel]] - [[Sió]] - [[Drava]] - [[Vuka]] - [[Tisza]] - [[Sava]] (entering at [[Belgrade]]) - [[Tamiš]] - [[Velika Morava]] - [[Caraş River|Caraş]] - [[Jiu River|Jiu]] - [[Iskar]] - [[Olt River|Olt]] - [[Vedea River|Vedea]] - [[Argeş River|Argeş]] - [[Ialomiţa River|Ialomiţa]] - [[Siret River|Siret]] - [[Prut River|Prut]]

==Modern navigation==
The Danube is navigable by ocean ships from the Black Sea to [[Braila|Brăila]], in [[Romania]] and by river ships to [[Kelheim]]; smaller craft can navigate further upstream to [[Ulm]], in Germany. About 60 of its tributaries are also navigable. See [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]].

Since the construction of the German [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]] in [[1992]], the river has been part of a trans-European waterway from [[Rotterdam]] on the [[North Sea]] to [[Sulina]] on the Black Sea (3500 km). In 1994 the Danube was declared one of ten [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridors]], routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to fifteen years. The amount of goods transported on the Danube increased to about 100 million tons in [[1987]]. In [[1999]], transport on the river was made difficult by the NATO bombing of 3 bridges in [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The clearance of the debris was finished in [[2002]]. The temporary pontoon bridge that hampered navigation was finally removed in 2005.

At the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], the Danube flows through a [[gorge]] that forms part of the boundary between [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]]; it contains two [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[dams]], [[Đerdap]] I and [[Đerdap]] II.

The [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]] shortens the distance to the Black Sea by 400 km and another canal in Romania, while the [[Danube-Bucharest Canal]] (unfinished) is supposed to link Danube to [[Bucharest]]. In Serbia and Montenegro there is Dunav-[[Tisa]]-Dunav channel as well.

[[Image:Danubemap.JPG|thumb|right|290px|A map showing the Danube]]

==The Danube delta==
:''Main article [[Danube Delta]]''.
The Danube Delta has been a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1991. Its wetlands (on the [[Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance]]) support vast flocks of migratory birds, including the endangered [[Pygmy Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''). Rival canalization and drainage scheme threaten the delta: see [[Bastroe Channel]].

==Geology==
Although the headwaters of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the [[Rhine]], with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the [[Alps]] mountains which flows north towards the [[North Sea]], an invisible line divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the [[European Watershed]].

However, before the last [[ice age]] in the [[Pleistocene]], the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called ''Urdonau'' (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the [[Swabian Alb]]. After the [[Upper Rhine Valley]] had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.

Since the [[Swabian Alb]] is largely shaped of porous [[limestone]], and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alp, which are referred to as the ''Donauversickerung'' (Danube Sink). Most of this water resurfaces only 12 km south at the [[Aachtopf]], Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of 8,000 liters per second, north of [[Lake Constance]] - thus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide thus in fact only applies for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.

Since this enormous amount of underground water erodes much of its surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called [[Stream capture|stream capturing]].

==Human history==
[[Image:Ulm2-midsize.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Danube in Ulm, where it separates Ulm in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Neu-Ulm]] in [[Bavaria]].]]
The Danube basin contains sites of the earliest human cultures: the [[Danubian|Danubian Neolithic]] cultures include the [[Linear Pottery Culture]]s of the mid-Danube basin (see also [[Linear Ceramic culture]]) The [[Vucedol culture]] of the third millennium BC is famous for their ceramics. Later, many sites of the [[Vinca culture]] are sited along the Danube.  The river was part of the Roman empire's [[Limes Germanicus]].

Of importance for the Danube is also the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR). The ICPDR is an international organisation consisting of 13 member states (Germany, Austria, [[Czech Republic]], Slovakia, [[Slovenia]], Hungary, Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Serbia and Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) and the [[European Union]]. ICPDR, established in 1998, deals not only with the Danube itself, but with the whole Danube River Basin, which includes also its tributaries and the ground water resources. The goal of the ICPDR is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention, promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters for the benefit of the Danube River Basin countries and their people.

==Cultural significance==
[[Image:MariaValeriaBridge.jpg|thumb|left|At [[Esztergom]] and  [[Štúrovo]], the Danube separates [[Hungary]] from [[Slovakia]].]]
The Danube is mentioned in the title of a famous [[waltz]] by [[Austria]]n [[composer]] [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]], ''[[The Blue Danube|An der schönen, blauen Donau]]'' (''By the Beautiful Blue Danube'').

Another famous [[waltz]] about the Danube is ''[[The Waves of the Danube]]'' ([[Romanian]]: ''Valurile Dunării'') by the Romanian composer [[Ion Ivanovici]] (1845-1902), and the work took the audience by storm when performed at the 1889 [[Paris Exposition]].

The German tradition of landscape painting, the [[Danube school]], was developed in the Danube valley in the [[16th century]].

The most famous book describing the Danube ought to be Claudio Magris's masterpiece ''Danube'' (ISBN 1860468233).

==Economics of the Danube==
===Drinking water===
[[Image:danube_bratislava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Danube at Bratislava.]]
Along its path, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about ten million people. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], almost thirty percent (''[[As of 2004]]'') of the water for the area between [[Stuttgart]], [[Bad Mergentheim]], [[Aalen]] and the [[Alb-Donau-Kreis]] comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities like [[Ulm]] and [[Passau]] also use some water from the Danube.

In [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]], most water comes from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of [[Romania]] where the water is cleaner still use a lot of drinking water from the Danube.

===Navigation and transport===
As &quot;Corridor VII&quot; of the [[European Union]], the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]], the river connects the Black Sea with the industrial centers of Western Europe and with the Port of [[Rotterdam]]. The waterway is designed for large scale inland vessels (110 by 11,45 meters) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of it's course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 Locks). Further plans to build a number of new locks in order to improve navigation have been blocked by environmentalists, in spite of the general consensus about the positive effects of inland waterway transport in comparison with road and rail. 

[[Image:Frozen_Danube_Reichsbrücke.JPG|thumb|250px|A look upstream from the [[Donauinsel]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] during an unusually cold winter ([[February 2006]]). A frozen Danube is a phenomenon experienced only once or twice in a lifetime. ([[:Image:Frozen_Danube_Reichsbrücke.JPG|Details]])]]
Downstream from the Freudenau Locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the Gabcikovo dam and locks near Bratislava and the two double Iron Gate locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions (similar to the locks in the Russian [[Volga]] river, some 300 by over 30 meters). Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than 860 kilometers.

The Danube connects with the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal at Kelheim, and with the Wiener Donaukanal in Vienna. Apart from a couple of secundary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the Drava, Sava and Tisza. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the Duna-Tisza-Duna canals, links sections downstream and upstream of the Tisza mouth with this tributary of the Danube.

===Fishing===
The importance of fishing on the Danube, which used to be critical in the [[Middle Ages]], has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the [[Danube Delta]] still has an important industry.

==Tourism==
There are many important tourist and natural spots along the Danube, including the [[Wachau]] valley, the [[Nationalpark Donau-Auen]] in Austria, the [[Naturpark Obere Donau]] in [[Germany]],[[Kopacki rit]] in [[Croatia]], [[Iron Gates]] (Danube [[Gorge]]) and [[Danube Delta]] in [[Romania]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Donegal fiddle tradition''' is a kind of [[Irish traditional music]], based on a tradition, or set of coexisting traditions, at least 200 years old, of playing the [[fiddle]] in [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]].  Donegal is a remote, partly [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking county in northwestern Ireland and one of the three counties of the northern Irish province of [[Ulster]] that are part of the [[Republic of Ireland]].  Donegal's tradition of fiddle playing has completely eclipsed other instrumental traditions in the county.

There is a so-called Donegal style of fiddling, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county.  To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterized by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more straight-ahead (unswung) in the playing of the fast dance tune types ([[reel (dance)|reel]] and [[jig]]s); short (one-note-per-bowstroke), aggressive bowing; relatively sparse ornamentation; the use of bowed triplets (also known as trebles) more often than rolls (an ornament like a turn) as ornaments; the use of double stops and droning (playing on more than one string at once); and the occurrence of &quot;playing the octave&quot;, with one player playing the medley and the other playing the medley an octave lower.  None of these characteristics is universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all.  But in general, aggressive and lively fiddling is very often heard in Donegal, which many listeners find exciting.  Donegal styles have been influenced to a great extent by southern Irish styles as well as [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Shetland Islands|Shetland Island]] styles and repertoire, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Highland [[bagpipe|bagpipes]] (the so-called Scottish warpipes).  

Another feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played.  Highlands, a 4/4 type of tune based on Scottish [[strathspeys]], which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county.  Other tune types common in the county, but relatively uncommon elsewhere, include barndances, also called &quot;germans,&quot; and [[mazurka]]s.

==History==

[[Image:Donegalmap.jpg|right|thumb|Map showing the geography and some of the different regions of Donegal.]]There are, of course, a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal.  Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family.  [[Hugh Doherty (fiddler)|Hugh Doherty]] is the first known musician of this family.  Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in [[1980 in music|1980]], of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, [[John Doherty (fiddler)|John Doherty]].  John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded.  John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's. 

As said before, there has been no single Donegal style but several distinctive styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of Donegal including [[Inishowen]], [[East Donegal]], [[The Rosses]] and [[Gweedore]], [[Croaghs]], [[Teelin]], [[Kilcar]], [[Glencolmcille]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Bundoran]]. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Famous players, now dead, of the older Donegal styles include Neillidh (&quot;Neilly&quot;) Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy, and Frank Cassidy. A great fiddler from Donegal who bears mention, but who did not play in a traditional Donegal style, was [[Hugh Gillespie]]. Some great living Donegal fiddlers, include [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]], [[Vincent Campbell]], [[John Gallagher (fiddler)|John Gallagher]], [[Paddy Glackin]], [[Danny O'Donnell (fiddler)|Danny O'Donnell]], and [[Tommy Peoples]]. 

==Modern Players==

[[Image:Muintiraltan.gif|left|thumb|The current line-up of well known Donegal band '''Altan'''.]]
The popularity of fiddle playing continues in Donegal. Among the many younger players, the three fiddlers of the Donegal &quot;supergroup&quot; [[Altan]], [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]], [[Paul O'Shaughnessy]], and [[Ciarán Tourish]], are commonly regarded as brilliant, as are Mick Brown, Martin Mcginley, Dermot Mclaughlin, and others too numerous to mention by name.  Finally, although he is not known as a fiddle player, [[Dermot Byrne]], the [[button accordion]] player currently with Altan, has a style and repertoire that is firmly within the Donegal instrumental tradition; he is widely regarded as one of the finest button accordion players in Ireland.  [[Liz Doherty]] is the youngest member of this tradition. Her album &quot;Last Orders&quot; appeared in 1999.

The fiddle, and traditional music in general, has remained popular in Donegal not just because of the international success of certain artist, because of local pride in the music. Traditional music ''[[Irish traditional music session|Seisiúns]]'' are still common place both in [[pubs]] and in houses, even outside the tourist season. Music is still taught by the family members or by neighbours keeping regional styles alive and distinct. The Donegal fiddle music has been influence by [[recorded music]] but this is thought by many players as having a positive effect on the music, varying the techniques used and broadening its repretoire tunes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''double-barreled shotgun''' is a [[shotgun]] with two barrels, unlike single-barrelled shotguns capable of multiple shots such as [[pump action shotgun]]s or [[semi-automatic shotgun]]s. Most have two triggers, one for each barrel. When the shooter pulls both triggers together, both cartridges will fire, resulting in a wider spread of shot. Alternatively, a shooter can pull the triggers sequentially to fire two ordinary shotgun blasts in close succession. Usually, one of the barrels will have greater &quot;choke&quot; than the other, which is a more pronounced reduction of the inner radius of the barrel near the muzzle, giving a narrower spread of shot from that barrel.  This enables the shooter to use the unchoked barrel for closer shots and the choked barrel for more distant shots, making the gun more versatile.

Although double-barrelled shotguns are capable of firing two shots in very rapid succession, they then require a time-consuming reload. (Although in recent years, automatic shot ejectors have been implemented into the design, reducing reloading to just sticking the shells in without having to pull the used shells out.) In general, the entire barrel is hinged to the stock and the cartridges are changed at the base of the barrel while the gun is in the open position.  The double-barreled shotgun is therefore an excellent tool for many [[hunting]], pest control or home defense applications, but may be less useful for police force or military applications.

An &quot;over and under&quot; shotgun (or a [[Bock-type]] shotgun) is a type of double barreled shotgun in which the barrels sit one on top of the other (contrast with the &quot;side by side&quot; shotgun, in which the two barrels lie beside each other). The latter is the most classic archetypical image of what a shotgun should look like. &quot;Over and under&quot; shotguns often have only one trigger, which fires the two barrels successively. They are often used for sporting competitons such as [[trap shooting]] or [[Skeet shooting|skeet]], since for those sports, the barrels' difference in elevation is considered less of a problem than the difference in windage from side-by-side shotguns. Elaborately decorated, precision engineered over-and-under guns are among the most expensive of all [[firearms]], and were once a traditional present to statesmen.

&quot;[[Sawn-off shotgun]]s&quot; are usually made from double barreled shotguns. Unlike tube magazine shotguns (such as pump action or semi-automatic varieties), the double barrelled shotgun has no mechanism forward of the breech, so sawing off much of the barrel does not prevent it from operating. Consequently, [[criminal]]s who desire a more readily concealed firearm may saw off much of the barrels (and perhaps also the stock) to shorten the gun. The resulting weapon is much less powerful and quite inaccurate. Modifying a shotgun in this way is illegal in most [[jurisdiction]]s, and often the barrels are severely weakened by the modification making it more likely they will be blown apart by the shot.  One commercial production version was the Ithaca firearms company Auto and Burglar gun, a double-barrelled shotgun pistol.

A related but rarer variant is a [[Drilling (firearm)|drilling]] (from the German &quot;drei&quot;, meaning three), a firearm constructed with three barrels: usually two &quot;side by side&quot; shotgun barrels, and a single shot [[rifle]] barrel beneath them. This arrangement allows a hunter to hunt small game or fowl with a double-barrelled shotgun, but have a rifle shot instantly available if a longer range shot, or heavier game, is encountered. Drillings are mainly encountered in Central [[Europe]].

An even rarer type of gun is the [[Vierling (firearm)|vierling]], a firearm constructed with four barrels. It's basically a drilling with a second rifled barrel placed above the two &quot;side by side&quot; shotgun barrels. Once very popular, the drillings - and especially the vierlings - are very hard to find nowadays.

Double-barrelled rifles also exist, with hunters traditionally preferring them for dangerous game in Africa where the ability to fire two shots quickly, without reloading and without danger of the mechanism jamming, could be critical.

[[Image:desserts.jpg|right|frame|A selection of desserts]]

'''Dessert''' is a course that typically comes at the end of a dinner, usually consisting of sweet [[food]] but sometimes of a strongly flavored one, such as some [[cheese]]s. The word comes from the [[Old French]] ''desservir'', meaning &quot;to clear the table&quot;. '''Dessert''' is most commonly used in [[Hiberno-English]], [[American English|American English]], [[Canadian English]], [[Australian English]] and in [[French language|French]]. '''Sweet''', '''pudding''' or '''afters''' would be more typical in other variants of [[Commonwealth English]] for this course. 

Dessert as a standard part of a [[Western world|Western]] meal is a relatively recent development. Before the [[19th-century]] rise of the [[middle class]], and the [[mechanization]] of the [[sugar]] industry, sweets were a privilege of the [[aristocracy]], or a rare [[holiday]] treat. As sugar became cheaper and more readily available, the development and popularity of desserts spread accordingly. 

Some cultures do not have a separate final sweet course but mix sweet and savoury dishes throughout the meal as in [[Chinese cuisine]], or reserve elaborate dessert concoctions for special occasions. Often, the dessert is seen as a separate meal or snack rather than a course, and may be eaten some time after the meal (usually in less formal settings). Some restaurants specialize in dessert.

}}

The '''Data Encryption Standard''' ('''DES''')  is a [[cipher]] (a method for [[encrypt]]ing information) selected as an official [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) for the [[United States]] in 1976, and which has subsequently enjoyed widespread use internationally. The algorithm was initially controversial, with [[classified information|classified]] design elements, a relatively short [[key length]], and suspicions about a [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) [[backdoor]]. DES consequently came under intense [[academia|academic]] scrutiny, and motivated the modern understanding of [[block cipher]]s and their [[cryptanalysis]]. 

DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; DES keys have been broken in less than 24 hours. There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of [[Triple DES]], although there are theoretical attacks. In recent years, the cipher has been superseded by the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES).

In some documentation, a distinction is made between DES as a standard, and the algorithm, which is referred to as the '''DEA''' (the '''Data Encryption Algorithm'''). When spoken, &quot;DES&quot; is either spelled out (''dee-ee-ess'') or pronounced as a single syllable (''dez'').

==History of DES==
The origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a study on the US government's [[computer security]] needs, the US standards body [[NBS]] (National Bureau of Standards) — now renamed [[NIST]] (National Institute of Standards and Technology) — identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.  Accordingly, on [[15 May]] [[1973]], after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions, however, turned out to be suitable. A second request was issued on [[27 August]] [[1974]]. This time, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable, a cipher developed during the period 1973–1974 based on an earlier algorithm, [[Horst Feistel]]'s [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer]] cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, [[Walter Tuchman]], [[Don Coppersmith]], Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant Tuckerman.

===NSA's involvement in the design===
On [[17 March]] [[1975]], the proposed DES was published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from various parties, including from [[public-key cryptography]] pioneers [[Martin Hellman]] and [[Whitfield Diffie]], citing a shortened [[key length]] and the mysterious &quot;[[Substitution_box|S-box]]es&quot; as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they — but no-one else — could easily read encrypted messages. Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, &quot;We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different.&quot; The [[United States Senate]] [[Select Committee on Intelligence]] reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:
:&quot;In the development of DES, NSA convinced [[IBM]] that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.&quot;
However, it also found that
:&quot;NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.&quot;
Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, is quoted as saying, &quot;We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!&quot; 

Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of [[differential cryptanalysis]], a general method for breaking block ciphers.  The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique back in the 1970s. This was indeed the case—in 1994, Don Coppersmith published the original design criteria for the S-boxes.  IBM had discovered differential cryptanalysis in the 1970s and, after securing DES, had been instructed to keep the technique secret by the NSA. Coppersmith explains, &quot;that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.&quot;. Shamir himself commented, &quot;I would say that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.&quot;

The other criticism—that the key length was too short—was supported by the fact that the reason given by the [[NSA]] for reducing the key length from 64 bits to 56 was that the other 8 bits could serve as [[parity]] bits, which seemed somewhat specious. It is widely believed that NSA's decision was motivated by the possibility that they would be able to [[brute force attack]] a 56 bit key several years before the rest of the world would.

===The algorithm as a standard===
Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on [[15 January]] [[1977]] as '''FIPS PUB 46''', authorised for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in [[1983]], [[1988]] (revised as '''FIPS-46-1'''), 1993 ('''FIPS-46-2'''), and again in 1998 ('''FIPS-46-3'''), the latter prescribing &quot;[[Triple DES]]&quot; (see below). On [[26 May]] [[2002]], DES was finally superseded by [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], the Advanced Encryption Standard, following a public competition (see [[AES process]]). Even [[as of 2004]], however, DES remains in widespread use.

Another theoretical attack, [[linear cryptanalysis]], was published in 1994, but it was a [[brute force attack]] in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of [[cryptanalysis]] are discussed in more detail later in the article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. Bruce Schneier writes:
: ''&quot;Off the record, NSA has characterized DES as one of their biggest mistakes. If they knew the details would be released so that people could write software, they would never have agreed to it. DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study: one that the NSA said was secure.&quot;''

==Replacement algorithms==
Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in [[software]] motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative [[block cipher]] designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s; for example [[RC5]], [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]], [[NewDES]], [[SAFER]], [[CAST5]] and [[FEAL]]. Most of these designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key.

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use [[Triple DES]] (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see [[Federal Information Processing Standard |FIPS]] Pub 46-3); it involves applying DES three times with different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is [[DES-X]], which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. [[GDES]] was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.

In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher: the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name [[Rijndael]]. Other finalists in the NIST [[AES competition]] included [[RC6]], [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]], [[MARS]], and [[Twofish]].

==Description==
[[Image:DES-main-network.png|right|250px|thumb|''Figure 1'' — The overall Feistel structure of DES]]
:''For brevity, the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm; for reference, the details can be found in [[DES supplementary material]].''
DES is the archetypal [[block cipher]] — an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of [[plaintext]] bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another [[ciphertext]] bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] is 64 bits. DES also uses a [[key (cryptography)|key]] to customize the transformation, so that decryption can only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking [[parity]], and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective [[key length]] is 56 bits, and it is usually quoted as such.

Like other block ciphers, DES must be used in a [[block cipher mode of operation|mode of operation]] if applied to a message longer than 64 bits. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES, including one for [[authentication]] [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip81.htm]. Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74 [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm].

===Overall structure===
The algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed ''rounds''. There is also an initial and final [[permutation]], termed ''IP'' and ''FP'', which are [[inverse (function)|inverse]]s (IP &quot;undoes&quot; the action of FP, and vice versa).  IP and FP have almost no cryptographic significance, but were apparently included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s hardware. Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the [[Feistel scheme]].

The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes — the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The red &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; symbol denotes the [[XOR|exclusive-OR]] (XOR) operation. The ''F-function'' scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are not swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.

===The Feistel (F) function===
The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:
[[Image:DES-f-function.png|left|thumb|270px|''Figure 2'' —The Feistel function (F-function) of DES]]

# ''Expansion'' — the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the ''expansion permutation'', denoted ''E'' in the diagram, by duplicating some of the bits. 
# ''Key mixing'' — the result is combined with a ''subkey'' using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys — one for each round — are derived from the main key using the ''[[key schedule]]'' (described below).
# ''Substitution'' — after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the ''[[Substitution_box|S-box]]es'', or ''substitution boxes''. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a [[lookup table]]. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES — without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
# ''Permutation'' — finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed [[permutation]], the ''P-box''. 

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called &quot;[[confusion and diffusion]]&quot; respectively, a concept identified by [[Claude Shannon]] in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

===Key schedule===
[[Image:DES-key-schedule.png|right|thumb|220px|''Figure 3'' — The key-schedule of DES]]
Figure 3 illustrates the ''key schedule'' for encryption  — the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by ''Permuted Choice 1'' (''PC-1'') — the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as [[parity]] check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by ''Permuted Choice 2'' (''PC-2'') — 24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot; in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar — it must generate the keys in the reverse order. Hence the rotations are to the right, rather than the left.

==Security and cryptanalysis==
Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute force attack, require an unrealistic amount of [[known plaintext|known]] or [[chosen plaintext]] to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

===Brute force attack===
For any cipher, the most basic method of attack is [[brute force attack|brute force]] — trying every possible key in turn. The [[key length|length of the key]] determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. It is known that the NSA encouraged, if not persuaded, IBM to reduce the key size from 128 to 64 bits, and from there to 56 bits; this is often taken as an indication that the NSA possessed enough computer power to break keys of this length even in the mid-1970s. 

[[Image:Board300.jpg|thumbnail|right|260px|The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'s US$250,000 [[EFF DES cracker|DES cracking machine]] contained 1,536 custom chips and could brute force a DES key in a matter of days — the photo shows a DES Cracker circuit board fitted with several Deep Crack chips.]]

In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s.  In 1997, [[RSA Security]] sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest.  That contest was won by the DESCHALL Project, led by Rocke Verser, [[Matt Curtin]], and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet.  The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see [[EFF DES cracker]]). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: &quot;''There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.''&quot; The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days' search; at about the same time at least one attorney from the US Justice Department was announcing that DES was unbreakable.

===Attacks faster than brute-force===
There are three attacks known that can break the full sixteen rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: [[differential cryptanalysis]] (DC), [[linear cryptanalysis]] (LC), and [[Davies' attack]]. However, the attacks are theoretical and are infeasible to mount in practice; these types of attack are sometimes termed [[certificational weakness]]es.

* ''Differential cryptanalysis'' was discovered in the late 1980s by [[Eli Biham]] and [[Adi Shamir]], although it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 2&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; [[chosen plaintext]]s. DES was designed to be resistant to DC.
* ''Linear cryptanalysis'' was discovered by Mitsuru Matsui, and needs 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; [[known plaintext]]s (Matsui, 1993); the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalisation of LC — ''multiple linear cryptanalysis'' — was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov et al (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (i.e. 2&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; instead of 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;). A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 2&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;–2&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; DES evaluations.
* ''Improved Davies' attack'': while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialised technique for DES, first suggested by Davies in the eighties, and improved by Biham and Biryukov (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; [[known plaintext]]s, has a computational complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, i.e. versions of DES with fewer than sixteen rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a &quot;security margin&quot; the full version retains. [[Differential-linear cryptanalysis]] was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 2&lt;sup&gt;15.8&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts and has a 2&lt;sup&gt;29.2&lt;/sup&gt; time complexity (Biham et al, 2002).

===Minor cryptanalytic properties===
DES exhibits the [[complementation property]], namely that
:&lt;math&gt;E_K(P)=C \Leftrightarrow E_\overline{K}(\overline{P})=\overline{C}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the bitwise complement of &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_K&lt;/math&gt; denotes encryption with key &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The complementation property means that the work for a [[brute force attack]] could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a [[chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext]] assumption.

DES also has four so-called ''[[weak key]]s''. Encryption (''E'') and decryption (''D'') under a weak key have the same effect (see [[involution]]):
:&lt;math&gt;E_K(E_K(P)) = P&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E_K = D_K&lt;/math&gt;
There are also six pairs of ''semi-weak keys''. Encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys, &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, operates identically to decryption with the other, &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{K_1}(E_{K_2}(P)) = P&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E_{K_2} = D_{K_1}&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible.

DES has also been proved not to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]], or more precisely, the set &lt;math&gt;\{E_K\}&lt;/math&gt; (for all possible keys &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) under [[functional composition]] is not a group, nor &quot;close&quot; to being a group (Campbell and Wiener, 1992). This was an open question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as Triple DES would not increase the security.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''double-hulled tanker''' is a large [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] [[ship]] used for transporting [[liquid]]s (usually [[petroleum]]).

The ship has two hulls to prevent the liquid cargo from spilling; if the outer hull is breached, the inner hull keeps the transported substance in place.

Double-hulled tankers were required under 46 USC § 3703a after the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]]. The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed The [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] requiring double-hull tankers now, but allowing the transportation companies until [[2015]] to replace existing tankers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word '''drink''' is primarily a verb, meaning to ingest liquids. As a noun, it refers to the liquid thus ingested. It is often used in a narrower sense to refer to [[alcoholic beverage]]s (as both a verb and a noun). ''Drink'' is also [[slang]] for a body of [[water]], such as an [[ocean]] or a water hazard on a [[golf]] course (e.g. &quot;He hit that one into the drink.&quot;). To ''drink in'' is also  used metaphorically, as in ''to drink in the scenery''.

A '''beverage''' is a drink specifically prepared for human consumption. Beverages almost always largely consist of [[water]]. Water is essential for living, significantly more so than food. Death will usually occur after 1 week without any liquids but humans have been known to survive some months without food. Drinks often consumed include:

[[Image:Dill dried umbel.jpg|thumb|Dried Dill-umbel]]
'''Dill''' (''Anethum graveolens'') is a short-lived [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]], native to southwest and central [[Asia]]. It is the sole species of the genus ''Anethum'', though classified by some botanists in the related genus ''[[Peucedanum]]'' as ''Peucedanum graveolens'' (L.) C.B.Clarke.

It grows to 40-60 cm tall, with slender stems and alternate, finely divided, softly delicate [[leaf|leaves]] 10-20 cm long. The ultimate leaf divisions are 1-2 mm broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of [[Fennel]], which are thread-like, less than 1 mm broad, but harder in texture. The [[flower]]s are white to yellow, in small [[umbel]]s 2-9 cm diameter. The [[seed]]s are 4-5 mm long and 1 mm thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.

===Cultivation and uses===
Dill has long been cultivated as a herb throughout [[Europe]] and north [[Africa]] as well as in its native Asia. It was used by [[Egypt]]ian doctors 5000 years ago and traces have been found in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins in [[Great Britain]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was thought to protect against witchcraft [http://www.selfsufficientish.com/dill.htm].

In [[Semitic languages]] it is known by the name of '''Shubit'''. The [[Talmud]] requires that [[tithe]]s shall paid on the seeds, leaves, and stem of dill. The [[Bible]] reports that the [[Pharisee]]s were in the habit of paying this tithe; [[Jesus]] rebuked them for tithing dill but omitting mercy.

The name dill is thought to have originated from a Norse or Anglo-Saxon word 'dylle' meaning to soothe or lull, the plant having the carminative property of allaying pain.

Like [[caraway]], its fernlike leaves are aromatic, and are used to flavour many [[food]]s, such as [[gravad laks]] (pickled [[salmon]]), [[borscht]] and other [[soup]]s and [[pickle]]s. The seeds are also used to flavour pickles. Dill leaves must be used fresh, as they lose their flavour rapidly if dried; even [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] dill leaves have very little flavour. It is thus necessary to grow a supply of plants, rather than store the leaves.

Successful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well drained soil. The seeds are viable for 3-10 years. Plants intended for seed for further planting should not be grown near fennel, as the two species can [[hybrid]]ise.

The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Draw poker''' is any [[poker variant]] in which each player is dealt a complete hand before the first betting round, and then develops the hand for later rounds by replacing cards.

The descriptions below assume that you are familiar with the general [[Poker game play|game play]] of [[poker]], and with [[Hand (poker)|hand values]] (both high and low variations).  They also make no assumptions about what [[Betting (poker)|betting structure]] is used.  In home games, it is typical to use an [[ante]], and betting always begins with the player to the dealer's left.  In casino play, it is more common to use [[Blind (poker)|blind]]s; the first betting round thus begins with the player to the left of the big blind, and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left, thus draw games are very [[Position (poker)|positional]].

Some sample deals below will assume that a game is being played by four players: Alice, who is dealing in the examples, Bob, who is sitting to her left, Carol to his left, and David to Carol's left.

==Standard five-card draw==

[[Image:Draw-poker-table.png|right|300px|Draw poker]]

This is often the first poker variant learned by most players, and is very common in home games although it is now quite rare in casino and tournament play.  When played skillfully, it can become monotonous.  The lowball variations described later are more interesting games.  Two to eight players can play.

Play begins with each player being dealt five cards, one at a time, all face down.  The remaining deck stub is placed aside, often protected by placing a chip or other marker on it.  Players pick up the cards and hold them in their hands, being careful to keep them concealed from the other players.  The first betting round occurs at this point, starting with the player to the dealer's left.  If more than one player remains after this round, the &quot;draw&quot; phase begins.  Each player specifies how many of his cards he wishes to replace, and discards that many from his hand.  The deck stub is retrieved, and after a [[burn card]] is dealt, each player in turn is dealt the same number of cards he discarded, so that each player again has five cards.  It is important that each player discards the cards he wishes to replace before he takes any replacements, and that he take the same number of replacements as he discarded.  A second betting round occurs after the draw phase, followed by a showdown if more than one player remains.

A common &quot;house rule&quot; in some places is that a player may not replace more than three cards, unless he draws four cards while keeping an ace (or wild card).  This rule is only needed for low-limit social games where many players will stay for the draw, and will help avoid depletion of the deck stub.  In more serious games such as those played in casinos it is unnecessary and generally not used.  A rule that ''is'' used by many casinos is that a player is not allowed to draw five consecutive cards from the deck.  In this case, if a player wishes to replace all five of his cards, he is given four of them in turn, the other players are given their draws, and then the dealer returns to that player to give him his fifth replacement (if no later player drew, it is necessary to deal a burn card first).

Another common house rule is that the bottom card of the deck is never given as a replacement, to avoid the possibility of someone who might have seen it during the deal using that information.  If the deck stub is depleted during the draw before all players have received their replacements, the last players can receive cards chosen randomly from among those discarded by previous players.  For example, if the last player to draw wants three replacements but there are only two cards remaining in the deck stub, the dealer gives the player the one top card he can give, then shuffles together the bottom card of the deck, the burn card if any, and the earlier players' discards (but not the three discards of the last player!), and finally deals two more replacements to the last player.

'''Example:''' Alice deals five cards to each player and places the deck stub aside.  Bob opens the betting round by betting $1.  Carol folds, David calls, and Alice calls, closing the betting round.  Bob now declares that he wishes to replace three of his cards, so he removes those three cards from his hand and discards them.  Alice retrieves the deck stub, deals a burn card, and then deals three cards directly to Bob, who puts them in his hand.  David discards one card, and Alice deals one card to him from the deck stub.  Alice now discards three of her own cards, and replaces them with three from the top of the deck stub.  Now a second betting round begins.  Bob checks, David bets $3, Alice calls, and Bob folds, ending the second betting round.  David shows a flush, and Alice shows two pair, so David takes the pot.

==Other draw games==

===Gardena jackpots (&quot;Jacks to open&quot; or simply &quot;Jackpots&quot;)===
Played as above, with standard hand values, and with a single joker in the deck acting as a [[Bug (poker)|bug]].  Always played with an ante and no blinds.  On the first betting round, no player is allowed to open the betting unless his hand already contains a pair of jacks or a better hand.  Other players who checked on the first round may subsequently call or raise if someone else opens.  If no player opens, a new deal begins and everyone antes again into the same pot.  The player who opened the betting keeps his discarded cards near him on the table so that he can prove, if necessary, that he had a sufficient opening hand.  For example, a player with the '''K''', '''J''', '''9''', and '''7''' of clubs and the '''J''' of hearts has a pair of jacks and may open.  He may wish to &quot;break openers&quot; in this case by discarding the jack of hearts in an attempt to make the club flush, so he keeps the discarded jack to prove that he was entitled to open.

The game is named after the city of Gardena, California, where this game was especially popular from the 1930s to 1970s (though it was always secondary to lowball).  At that time, there were more public poker tables in that small city than in all the rest of the [[United States]].  Public poker rooms are still a big industry there, though Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and other locations now have many more poker rooms than they did at that time.  Because &quot;Jacks to open&quot; was the primary form of high-hand draw poker played there, traditional draw poker was often described by the [[retronym]] &quot;Guts to open&quot;.

In home games, it is common that when a deal is &quot;passed out&quot; (that is, when no one opens), the players re-ante, and the qualifier to open is raised to a pair of queens.  If that deal is passed out, the qualifier is raised to kings, and finally to aces.  This is called &quot;progressive&quot; jackpots.

===California lowball===

This was the primary poker game played in California during the heyday of Gardena in the 1970s.  It is still played today, though its popularity has somewhat lessened since the introduction of [[stud poker]] and [[community card poker]] to the state.

Played as above, using [[ace-to-five low]] hand values, with a single joker in the deck.  Always played with blinds rather than antes, so players may not check on the first betting round (but may on the second round).  A player with a '''7'''-high hand or better who checks after the draw forfeits his right to win any money placed in the pot after the draw.  (In other words, you may not check a &quot;seven&quot; unless you intend to fold when someone else bets).  Another common rule in low-limit games is that a player who checks on the second betting round may not subsequently raise on that round.  This latter rule is never used in games with a pot limit or no limit betting structure.

===Badougi===

Also sometimes known as Padooki, Badougi is a four card [[ace-to-five low]] lowball variant where traditional poker hand rankings are changed. A Badougi is a four card hand where all the cards are of different ranks and suits. Any cards which match another card in rank or suit does not play and the first criteria for evaluating hands is the number of cards which are playing. The following is the ranking of several example of hands from best to worst:
#Ace of spades, 2 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 4 of diamonds: 4 card 4 high best possible Badougi
#4 of spades, 6 of hearts, 8 of diamonds, J of clubs: 4 card J high Badougi
#Ten of clubs, J of hearts, Q of Diamonds, K of hearts: 4 card worst possible Badougi
#Ace of hearts, Ace of diamonds, 4 of clubs, 5 of spades: 3 card hand, 5 high
#Ace of clubs, Ace of spades, 4 of spades, 6 of spades: 2 card hand, 4 high

Badougi is usually played triple-draw, with a 1-1-2-2 betting structure, although it also plays well at no limit.

===Other forms of lowball===

Five-card draw, with no joker, and [[deuce-to-seven low]] hand values is called &quot;Kansas City&quot; or &quot;Low Poker&quot; or even &quot;Billy Baxter&quot; draw in honor of the player who dominated the world championship in the event for many years.  The '''7'''-high rule and the no check-and-raise rule do not apply.  In the eastern United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere, [[ace-to-six low]] hand values are common.

===California high/low split===

Played as above, with a single joker, used as a [[Bug (poker)|bug]].  High hand and low hand (using the [[ace-to-five low]] values) [[split (poker)|split]] the pot.  An '''8'''-high or better low is required to win low.  If no hand qualifies low, high hand takes the whole pot.  Played [[cards speak]], that is, players do not declare whether they intend to win the high or low half of the pot (or both); they simply show their cards and the best hands win.  Because ace-to-five low values are used, a hand such as a low straight or flush can win both high and low, called &quot;scooping&quot; or &quot;hogging&quot; the pot.

===High/low with declare===

This is common in home games but is rarely found in casinos today.  Played as are other versions of five-card draw, but after the second betting round and before the showdown, there is a simultaneous [[Declaration (poker)|declaration]] phase.  Each player takes two chips from his stack and takes them under the table, bringing up a closed fist that contains either no chips (indicating that the player intends to win the low half of the pot), one chip (indicating that the player intends to win the high half), or two chips (indicating that he intends to scoop).  When everyone has brought up the closed fist, the players all open their hands simultaneously to reveal their choices.  If any player shows two chips, and his hand is the best low and the best high, he scoops the pot.  Otherwise, half of the pot goes to the player with the highest hand who declared high, and the other half to the player with the lowest hand of those who declared low.  There is no qualifying hand to win either high or low, and if no one declares in one direction, the full pot is awarded in the other (for example, if all players declare low, the low hand wins the whole pot rather than half).  A player who declares for a scoop must win both ends outright, with no ties.  For example, if a player declares scoop, has the lowest hand clearly but ties for high, he wins nothing.  The other player with the same high hand wins the high half of the pot and the next-lowest hand wins low (assuming he declared low--if no other player declared low, the high hand who declared high wins the whole pot).

This game can be played with [[deuce-to-seven low]] or [[ace-to-six low]] hand values, but in that case it is nearly impossible to scoop (though you can still win the whole pot if everyone declares the same direction).

===Double-draw and Triple-draw===

Any game above can be played with two or three draw phases and therefore three or four betting rounds.  Double-draw California lowball is a particularly good game.  Triple draw lowball, either [[ace-to-five low|ace-to-five]] or [[deuce-to-seven low|deuce-to-seven]], has gained some popularity among serious players.  The 2004 [[World Series of Poker]] included a deuce-to-seven triple-draw lowball event.

===Four-before===

Another variation that can be applied to any game above, but that is especially suited to lowball.  On the initial deal, only four cards are dealt to each player.  A betting round follows, then each player draws one more card than he discards, completing his hand to five cards.  Then the final betting round and showdown.  Note that it is impossible to be dealt a &quot;pat&quot; hand, that is, a hand (such as a straight or flush) that is complete before the draw.

===Johnson (and &quot;Jacks back&quot;)===

Played with one joker which acts as a [[Bug (poker)|bug]].  Must be played with antes and no blinds.  Each player is dealt five cards.  The first betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left, who may check or open with anything.  If any player opens, the game continues as traditional five-card draw poker.  If the first round is passed out (that is, no one opens), then the player to the dealer's left may now open if he chooses, but the game has switched to California lowball.  On the rare occasion that the deal is passed out yet again, players re-ante and deal again.  This game plays well head-up (that is, with only two players).  When the game is played that a pair of jacks or better is required to open on the first high-hand round, the game is called &quot;Jacks back&quot;.

Some examples might help clarify: On the first deal, players ante and Alice deals five cards around.  Bob sees that he has a '''6'''-high straight, which is a very good hand for both high and low.  He also wants to be deceptive about the value of his hand, so he checks.  Carol opens for $1, David folds, Alice raises to $2, and Bob (who now realizes that Carol and Alice want to play high hands) reraises to $3, which is called by Carol and Alice.  Bob announces that he &quot;stands pat&quot; (draws no cards).  Carol draws three cards, and Alice draws two.  Bob bets $2, Carol folds, Alice raises, and Bob calls.  Bob shows his straight, but Alice has made a full house and wins the pot.

On the second deal, Bob has the same hand: a '''6'''-high straight, and makes the same play, checking.  This time, Carol also checks, as does David, and finally Alice.  Now it is Bob's turn again, but now they are playing lowball.  He opens for $1.  Carol folds, and David raises to $2.  Alice folds, and Bob reraises to $3 (a '''6'''-high is a very good low hand; much better, in fact, than a '''6'''-high straight would be for high).  David calls.  Bob stands pat, and David draws one card.  Bob bets $2 (he is required to bet under California lowball rules since he has a hand better than '''7'''-high), and David calls.  Bob shows his '''6-5-4-3-2''' low, and David shows '''7-5-4-3-A''' low, and Bob wins with his '''6'''-high.

===Q-Ball===

This is a lowball game designed by [[Michael Wiesenberg]] that combines some of the variations mentioned above.  It is generally played with three [[Blind (poker)|blinds]]--one unit from the dealer, one unit to his left, and two units for the second player to the dealer's left.  The deck contains one joker.  Each player is dealt three cards, followed by a round of betting beginning with the player immediately after the big blind who may call the big blind, raise, or fold (there is no checking on the first round).  Next, each player is dealt a fourth card, followed by a second round of betting starting with the still-active player to the dealer's left.  No checking is allowed on this round either, despite the fact that there is no bet facing the first player; the first player must [[Open (poker)|open]] or fold.  Each player is then dealt a fifth card, followed by a third betting round beginning on the dealer's left.  At this point, checking is allowed.  Finally, each player draws as in normal draw poker, followed by a fourth betting round and showdown.  [[Ace-to-five low]] values are used.

Played at [[Betting (poker)|fixed limit]], it is recommended that the betting structure be 1-2-2-4; that is, the second and third betting rounds should allow a bet of twice the amount of the first round, and the final bet should allow four times the amount of the first round.

==&quot;Home&quot; games==

These are somewhat less-serious games that are typically played only in home games at small stakes.  This does not necessarily mean that there is less opportunity for skillful play, just that the games are seen as more social than competitive.

To help grow the betting pot in a home game, one can add a variant known as the &quot;kill card&quot; to the rules.  Kill cards work best with stud games or shared card games as no one player can control when the &quot;kill card&quot; is played.

One popular &quot;kill card&quot; game is called Chernobyl Cowboy.  The &quot;Chernobyl Cowboy&quot; is the King of Hearts.  Whenever the King of Hearts appears face up in a [[stud]] or shared card game the game is dead.  All bets remain in the pot and the game begins again with a new ante and a new deal.  Anyone who has folded is out until the game concludes.  For example:  In a seven card stud game each player gets two cards down, then four cards up, then one final card down.  In a seven card stud game with a &quot;Chernobyl Cowboy&quot;, if the King of Hearts comes up during the time the four up cards are dealt, the game is killed and everyone who is still in antes again for a new round.

===Shotgun (&quot;Roll 'em out&quot; and &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot;)===

This is a draw game that plays much like a [[Stud poker|stud]] game.  First five cards are dealt to each player, followed by a betting round, and a draw.  Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a [[rollout]] phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves.  Each player's top card is now revealed, followed by a betting round.  Then each player reveals his next card, followed by a betting round.  Then a third card is revealed, followed by a betting round, a fourth card, a betting round, and finally a showdown.  Players may not change the order of their cards at any time during the rollout phase.

This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at [[high-low split]], in which case it is called &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot;.

===Spit in the ocean===

This might be classified as a hybrid draw/[[Community card]] game, but it is placed here because it plays mostly as a draw game.  On the initial deal, each player is dealt four cards, and then a single card is dealt to the center of the table face up.  This card plays as if it were the fifth card in every player's hand.  It is also a wild card, and every other card of its rank is also wild.  The first betting round is then played, followed by a draw in which each player replaces cards from his hand with an equal number, so that each player still has only four cards in hand.  A final betting round is followed by a showdown.  High-hand values are used.

Here's a sample deal: Alice deals four cards to each player, then deals the next card face up to the center of the table.  it is the '''6''' of diamonds, and this makes all '''6'''-spot cards wild.  Bob opens for $1, Carol raises to $2, David folds, Alice and Bob call.  Bob discards two cards, and receives two replacements.  Carol draws one card, and Alice draws one.  Bob checks, Carol bets $2, Alice raises to $4, Bob folds, Carol reraises to $6, and Alice calls.  The cards in Carol's hand are '''Q-Q-6-4'''.  Because the '''6''' in her hand and the one on the board are wild, her hand is four queens.  Alice's hand contains '''K-J-9-7''', all spades.  With the shared wild card, this gives her a flush, which loses to Carol's four queens.

===Anaconda (&quot;Pass the trash&quot;)===

Seven cards are dealt to each player.  Before the first betting round, each player examines his hand, and removes exactly three cards from his hand and places them on the table to his left.  After each person has thus discarded, he picks up the cards discarded by his right-hand neighbor and places them in his hand (thus, each player will have given three cards to his left-hand neighbor).  It is important that each player discard before looking at the cards he is to receive.  After the first pass, there is a betting round.  Then a second pass occurs, each player passing two cards to his right.  A second betting round is followed by a third pass, each player passing one card to his left.  Finally, a fourth betting round and a showdown, in which the player with the best five-card high hand he can make out of the seven in his hand wins the pot.

In some casual games, the showdown is replaced by a [[rollout]] phase, as described above in &quot;Shotgun&quot;.  This makes a total of eight betting rounds in the game, which generally destroys any chance for skillful play in the later rounds.

==Ad hoc variants==

Any of the above games can be modified in many ways upon player whim, by designating additional wild cards, betting rounds, more or fewer cards, altered hand values, and any other change agreed upon by all players prior to each deal.  You can announce such a game by using the name of an existing game and specifying the variations, for example &quot;Three-card Triple-draw California lowball, Kings wild&quot; (a surprisingly good game heads up).  Many times this will result in a game that does not play well, but occasionally will produce a game that is well-suited to a particular group of players.  Even if it doesn't, such games can be used sparingly to enliven an otherwise serious game.

Here are some general guidelines:
* If you want to designate some normal suited cards as wild, choose cards that would otherwise be bad for the game being played.  For example, deuces wild for high-hand games, kings wild for lowball, '''9'''-spots wild for [[high-low split]] (where an '''8'''-high or lower is necessary to win low).
* High-low split games play best with more than four players.
* When playing high-low split, it is necessary to have either a [[Declaration (poker)|declaration]] phase or a qualifier (but not both).  The most common form is '''8'''-high or better to qualify low, but also common is any pair/no pair (that is, a pair or better is required to win high, and no pair or better low is required to win low), and '''9'''-high for low.
* Designating more than four wild cards (or possibly six) will result in considerable confusion and many ties.
* Two to five betting rounds makes a good game.  One round or more than five rounds reduces the amount of skill involved.
* Sometimes there is no betting round before the draw; players pick up their cards, discard and draw, and then the betting starts.
* Giving each player more than eight or nine cards usually makes a bad game. (Note that in Anaconda, each player will have seen up to thirteen cards!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''defensive team''' or '''defense''' in [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]], is the team that begins a [[play from scrimmage]] not in possession of the ball.

Unlike the offensive team, there are no formally defined defensive positions.  A defensive player may line up anywhere on his side of the line of scrimmage and perform any legal action.  However, most sets used in American football include a line composed of '''defensive ends''' and '''defensive tackles''' and, behind the line, '''linebackers''', '''cornerbacks''', and '''safeties'''.

Defensive ends and tackles are collectively called '''defensive line''', while the cornerbacks and safeties are collectively called '''the secondary''', or '''defensive backs'''.

*'''defensive end (DE)''' - the two defensive ends play on opposite outside edges of the defensive line. Their function is to rush and / or attack the passer, or stop offensive runs to the outer edges of the line of scrimmage. The faster of the two is usually placed on the right because this is a right-handed [[quarterback]]'s blind side.
*'''defensive tackle (DT)''' - (sometimes called a ''defensive guard''), defensive tackles are side-by-side linemen who are 'sandwiched' between the defensive ends. Their function is to rush the passer (if they can shove past the offensive linemen blocking them), and stop running plays directed at the middle of the line of scrimmage. A defensive tackle that lines up directly across from the ball (and therefore, is almost nose-to-nose with the offense's ''[[center]]'') is often called a ''nose tackle'' or ''[[nose guard]]''. Common defensive sets have from one to three defensive tackles.
*'''linebacker (LB; more specifically, OLB, MLB, LOLB, ROLB )''' - linebackers play behind the defensive line and perform various duties depending on the situation, including rushing the passer, covering receivers, and defending against the run. Most defensive sets have between two and four linebackers. Linebackers are usually divided into three types: strongside (Left- or Right- Outside Linebacker: LOLB or ROLB); middle (MLB); and weakside (LOLB or ROLB).  The strongside linebacker usually lines up across from the offense's [[tight end]]; he is usually the strongest LB because he must be able to shed lead blockers quickly enough to tackle the [[running back]]. The middle linebacker must correctly identify the offense's formations and what adjustments the entire defense must make, all in the fleeting seconds before the offense starts play (by snapping the ball to the [[quarterback]]).  Because of this, the middle linebacker is nicknamed the 'quarterback of the defense'.  The weakside linebacker is usually the most athletic or fastest linebacker, because he usually must defend an open field.
*'''cornerback (CB)''' -- (typically) two players that primarily cover the wide receivers; they attempt to prevent successful quarterback passes by either swatting the airborne ball away from the receiver, or by catching the pass themselves (automatically switching possession of the ball to their team) -- an ''interception''.  In rushing situations, their job is to contain the rusher.
*'''safety (FS or SS)''' -- the safeties are the last line of defense (farthest from the line of scrimmage), and usually help the corners with deep-pass coverage.  The ''strong safety'' (SS) is usually the larger and stronger of the two, providing extra protection against run plays by standing somewhere between the free safety and the line of scrimmage. The ''free safety'' (FS) is usually the smaller and faster of the two, providing variable and extra pass protection. However, more recently, teams are looking for hybrid safeties who can do both jobs, as in a cover 2 defence, the strong safety has a greater role to play in coverage.
*'''nickel'''- and '''dime'''- backs -- in certain formations one extra (i.e., a fifth) defensive back (called a 'nickel' defense: a nickel coin = ''five'' cents) -- or even two extra (a fifth and sixth) DBs (called a 'dime' package: a dime = two nickels) -- may be used to augment the backfield and / or defensive line.  Nickelbacks and dimebacks are usually used to defend pass plays with extra receivers, but they can also be used to rush quarterbacks or runningbacks more quickly than linemen or most linebackers can.  A starting cornerback who is good at blitzing and tackling will sometimes be refered to as a nickleback, to distinguish them from cornerbacks who are better in coverage and poor in this respect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the existence of a '''dual vector space''' reflects in an abstract way the relationship between ''row'' vectors (1&amp;times;n) and ''column'' vectors (n&amp;times;1). The construction can also take place for infinite-dimensional spaces and gives rise to important ways of looking at [[measure (mathematics)|measures]], [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s, and [[Hilbert space]]. The use of the dual space in some fashion is thus characteristic of [[functional analysis]]. It is also inherent in the [[Fourier transform]].

== Algebraic dual space ==

Given any [[vector space]] V over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] F, we define the '''dual space''' V* to be the set of all [[linear functional]]s on V, i.e., [[scalar]]-valued [[linear transformation]]s on V (in this context, a &quot;scalar&quot; is a member of the base-field F).  V* itself becomes a vector space over F under the following definition of addition and scalar multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt; (\phi + \psi )( x ) = \phi ( x ) + \psi ( x ) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ( a \phi ) ( x ) = a \phi ( x ) \,&lt;/math&gt; 
for all &amp;phi;, &amp;psi; in V*, ''a'' in F and ''x'' in V.
In the language of [[tensor]]s, elements of V are sometimes called [[covariant]] vectors, and elements of V*, [[contravariant]] vectors, '''covectors''' or '''[[one-form]]s'''.

===Examples===

If the [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] of V is finite,
then V* has the same dimension as V;
if {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] for V, then the associated ''dual basis'' {'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} of V* is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
e^i (e_j)= \left\{\begin{matrix} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }i = j \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if } i \ne j \end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, its basis is B={e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=(1,0),e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(0,1)}.Then, e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a one-form (function which maps a vector to a scalar) such that e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=1, and e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=0. Similarity for e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Concretely, if we interpret '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as space of columns of ''n'' [[real number]]s, its dual space is typically written as the space of ''rows'' of ''n'' real numbers. Such a row acts on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as a linear functional by ordinary [[matrix multiplication]]. 

If V consists of the space of geometrical [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s (arrows) in the plane, then the elements of the dual V* can be intuitively represented as collections of parallel lines. Such a collection of lines can be applied to a vector to yield a number in the following way: one counts how many of the lines the vector crosses.

If V is infinite-dimensional, then the above construction of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; does not produce a basis for V* and the dimension of V* is greater than that of V. Consider for instance the space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;omega;)&lt;/sup&gt;, whose elements are those [[sequence]]s of real numbers which have only finitely many non-zero entries (dimension is countably infinite). The dual of this space is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;, the space of all sequences of real numbers (dimension is uncountably infinite). Such a sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is applied to an element (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;omega;)&lt;/sup&gt; to give the number &amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Bilinear products and dual spaces ===

As we saw above, if V is finite-dimensional, then V is isomorphic to V*, but the isomorphism is not [[natural transformation|natural]] and depends on the basis of V we started out with.  In fact, any isomorphism &amp;Phi; from V to V* defines a unique non-degenerate [[bilinear form]] on V by

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v,w \rangle = (\Phi (v))(w) \,&lt;/math&gt; 

and conversely every such non-degenerate bilinear product on a finite-dimensional space gives rise to an isomorphism from V to V*.

=== Injection into the double-dual ===

There is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[linear map|homomorphism]] &amp;Psi; from V into the double dual V**, defined by (&amp;Psi;(v))(&amp;phi;) = &amp;phi;(v) for all v in V, &amp;phi; in V*.  This map &amp;Psi; is always [[injective]]; it is an isomorphism if and only if V is finite-dimensional.

=== Transpose of a linear map ===

If &lt;math&gt;f: V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear operator|linear map]], we may define its ''transpose'' (also known as a [[pullback]], denoted ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;math&gt;{}^t f: W^*\rightarrow V^*&lt;/math&gt; by 
:&lt;div style=&quot;vertical-align: 20%;display:inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;
  {}^t f (\phi ) = \phi \circ f \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;W*&lt;/math&gt;.
The assignment &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto \, ^t f&lt;/math&gt; produces an [[injective]] [[homomorphism]] between the space of linear operators from V to W and the space of linear operators from W* to V*; this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] [[iff]] W is finite-dimensional. If the linear map ''f'' is represented by the [[matrix_(mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' with respect to two bases of V and W, then &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' is represented by the [[transpose|transposed matrix]] &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''A'' with respect to the dual bases of W* and V*.
If ''g'': W &amp;rarr; X is another linear map, we have &lt;math&gt;{}^t(g \circ f) = {}^t f \, \circ \, {}^t g&lt;/math&gt;.
In the language of [[category theory]], taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a [[contravariant functor]] from the category of vector spaces over F to itself.
Also, transposing twice gives the original map, to be more precise : 
&lt;math&gt;\psi_{W}(f(v))={}^t({}^t f) (\psi_{V}(v))&lt;/math&gt;


== Continuous dual space ==

When dealing with [[topological vector space]]s, one is typically only interested in the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear functionals from the space into the base field. This gives rise to the notion of the '''continuous dual space''' which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space. The continuous dual of a vector space ''V'' is denoted ''V''&amp;prime;. When the context is clear, the continuous dual may just be called the ''dual''. 

The continuous dual ''V''&amp;prime; of a [[normed vector space]] ''V'' (e.g., a [[Banach space]] or a [[Hilbert space]]) forms a normed vector space. The norm ||&amp;phi;|| of a continuous linear functional on ''V'' is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\|\phi \| = \sup \{ |\phi ( x )| : \|x\| \le 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;
This turns the continuous dual into a normed vector space, indeed into a Banach space so long as the underlying field is complete which is often included in the definition of the normed vector space.  In other words, the dual of a normed space over a complete field is necessarily complete.

For any ''finite-dimensional'' normed vector space or topological vector space, such as [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]], the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide. This is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space, as shown by the example of [[discontinuous linear map]].

=== Examples ===

Let 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; &amp;infin; be a real number and consider the Banach space [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'']] of all [[sequence]]s '''a''' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for which 
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{a}\|_p = \left ( \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n|^p \right) ^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. Define the number ''q'' by 1/''p'' + 1/''q'' = 1. Then the continuous dual of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is naturally identified with ''L&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'': given an element &amp;phi; &amp;isin; (''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'')', the corresponding element of ''L&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the sequence (&amp;phi;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the sequence whose ''n''th term is 1 and all others are zero. Conversely, given an element '''a''' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;isin; ''L&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'', the corresponding continuous linear functional &amp;phi; on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is defined by &amp;phi;('''b''') = &amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all '''b''' = (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;isin; ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' (see [[Hölder's inequality]]).

In a similar manner, the continuous dual of ''L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' is naturally identified with ''L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;''. Furthermore, the continuous duals of the Banach spaces ''c'' (consisting of all [[limit (mathematics)|convergent]] sequences, with the supremums norm) and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the sequences converging to zero) are both naturally identified with ''L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''.

=== Further properties ===

If ''V'' is a [[Hilbert space]], then its continuous dual is a Hilbert space which is anti-isomorphic to ''V''. This is the content of the [[Riesz representation theorem]], and gives rise to the [[bra-ket notation]] used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of [[quantum mechanics]].

In analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual, there is always a naturally defined injective continuous linear operator &amp;Psi; : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''V''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; from ''V'' into its continuous double dual ''V''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This map is in fact an [[isometry]], meaning ||&amp;Psi;(''x'')|| = ||''x''|| for all ''x'' in ''V''. Spaces for which the map &amp;Psi; is a [[bijection]] are called [[reflexive space|reflexive]].

The continuous dual can be used to define a new topology on ''V'', called the [[weak topology]].

If the dual of ''V'' is [[separable space|separable]], then so is the space ''V'' itself. The converse is not true; the space ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is separable, but its dual is ''l''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;, which is not separable.

{{otheruses4|the set of ideas and practices known as Dianetics|the book by L. Ron Hubbard first published in 1950|Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health}}

'''Dianetics''' is a set of ideas about the nature and structure of the human mind, and a set of associated practices which attempt to treat physical and mental ailments. It was developed primarily by author [[L. Ron Hubbard]] starting in the late 1940s and was first presented to the general public in his 1950 book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''. Hubbard characterized Dianetics as a revolutionary and scientifically developed alternative to conventional [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychiatry]]. He claimed that it could alleviate unwanted emotions, irrational fears and a wide range of illnesses that he regarded as being [[Psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]]. Since 1952 the subject has centered around the idea of an individual creating his mind, and thus being able to resolve any conditions of his mind. Dianetics became the foundation for the religion Hubbard subsequently founded, [[Scientology]]. Today the [[Church of Scientology]] practices and sells modern Dianetics.
	
Dianetics has been highly controversial since its launch in 1950. It has been criticized as [[pseudoscience]] and [[quackery]] by professional scientists and members of the medical community, and it has achieved no recognition among the mainstream scientific community as a ''bona fide'' [[scientific theory]].  While many practitioners of Scientology testify that they have found Dianetics techniques to be personally effective, there is a lack of independently corroborated empirical evidence in mainstream scientific literature for Hubbard's claims and the effectiveness of his methods. The troubled histories of the organizations established to promote Dianetics have added to the controversy that surrounds Dianetics.

==Basic concepts of Dianetics==

Hubbard coined the name Dianetics from the [[Greek language|Greek]] stems ''dia'', meaning &quot;through,&quot; and ''nous'', meaning &quot;mind,&quot; resulting in a word similar to the already-existing Greek adjective ''dianoētik-os'' διανοητικ-ός, meaning &quot;mental&quot;. The suffix &quot;-etics&quot; may have been inspired by [[cybernetics]], a [[vogue idea]] at the time, or [[semantics]]. Hubbard placed Dianetics in the same class as both of these concepts and made an explicit connection between the three concepts, stating that Dianetics &quot;forms a bridge between the [other] two.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;[http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ Terra Incognita: The Mind]&quot;, ''The Explorers Journal'', winter 1949 / spring 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics is presented as a systematic method of identifying the causes of and relieving many of an individual's mental, emotional or (psychosomatically) physical problems. Hubbard described Dianetics as &quot;an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of those of the physical sciences&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dianetics, the human mind may be considered as being made up of &quot;mental image pictures.&quot;  A mental image picture contains the many perceptions of a past moment, such as sounds, color, time of day and other perceptions.  For Dianetic's purposes these can be considered as literal pictures which can be viewed.  Dianetics focuses on one particular type of mental image picture that Hubbard called the [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]]. Engrams differ from other mental image pictures in that they contain unconciousness.  This unconciousness makes them unavailable as normal memories would be.  Engrams are painful memories that are not normally accessible to the consciousness of an individual.  Engrams are defined in Dianetics as &quot;a complete recording of a moment of [[unconsciousness]] containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; [[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary &lt;/ref&gt;  The primary activity of Dianetics is to help a person bring these half-hidden, painful memories into full conscious view.  Hubbard dubbed the well-functioning conscious aspect of the mind the &quot;analytical mind,&quot; which is claimed to be a flawless machine akin to a perfectly functioning calculator.  The collection of mental engrams are stored in the unconscious &quot;[[reactive mind]]&quot; (or &quot;reactive bank&quot;). Engrams are claimed to be the source of virtually all mental and emotional troubles or &quot;aberrations.&quot;

With Dianetics, Hubbard claimed to have discovered the fundamental &quot;dynamic principal of existence,&quot; which he expressed as a command to life, to &quot;SURVIVE!&quot;  Hubbard proposed that physical or mental traumas caused &quot;aberrations&quot; in the mind, which produced adverse physical and emotional effects. He postulated that since pain was a threat to survival, the human mind sought to avoid it. Thus, in moments of stress the conscious &quot;[[analytical mind]]&quot; would shut down and create engrams that are stored in the normally inaccessible &quot;reactive mind&quot;. 

With the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be reached at will and all stored engrams could be purged. The  central technique was &quot;auditing,&quot; a two-person question-and-answer therapy designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or &quot;mental masses&quot;).  A counselor called an auditor addresses a series of questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to memories or areas of discussion that appear to be fraught with pain or stress until such time that the troubling memory has been identified and satisfactorily confronted.  Through this method, the reactive mind could be &quot;cleared&quot; of its content; a person who had completed this process of &quot;clearing&quot; would be a &quot;[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]&quot;. 

The benefits of going &quot;Clear&quot; would be dramatic, according to Hubbard. A &quot;Clear&quot; would have no compulsions, repressions, pychoses or neuroses, and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as fifty points. He also claimed that as much as seventy percent of illnesses were psychosomatic and could thus be cured by Dianetics. These included [[asthma]], poor [[eyesight]], [[color blindness]], [[deafness|hearing deficiencies]], [[stutter]]ing, [[allergy|allergies]], [[sinusitis]], [[arthritis]], [[high blood pressure]], [[heart disease|coronary trouble]], [[dermatitis]], [[ulcer]]s, [[migraine]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[morning sickness]], [[alcoholism]], [[tuberculosis]] and the [[common cold]], to which Clears would be immune. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'', p. 125. New Era Publications, Copenhagen (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard also claimed that [[atheism]], &quot;zealotism&quot; (by which he seems to have meant [[fundamentalism]]) and [[homosexuality]] could be &quot;cured&quot; through Dianetics, as they were all caused by engrams. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Dianetics and Religion&quot;, ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard claimed that unlike conventional medical or mental therapies, Dianetics would work every time if applied properly and &quot;will invariably cure all psychosomatic ills and human aberrations.&quot;  In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: &quot;To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Dianetics&quot;. ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics has been extensively advertized by the Church of Scientology as being able to effect physical cures. The Church's Dianetics website still includes claims that while a student seeks spiritual gain with Dianetics &quot;the arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianetics.org/html/opencms/cos/dianetics/en_US/info/01/pg003.html Dianetics.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The best available total count of Clears in 2004 was 50,000, using analysis of official Scientology documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthaboutscientology.com/stats/clears/ &quot;Scientology Clears - Scientology's Stats Are Down&quot;], TruthAboutScientology.com, Accessed [[01 March]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dianetics procedure in practice==

The procedure of Dianetics therapy &amp;ndash; known as ''auditing'', from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''audire'', &quot;to listen&quot; &amp;ndash; is an activity undertaken by two people. One person, the &quot;auditor&quot;, guides the other person, the &quot;preclear&quot; (often also referred to by Hubbard as the &quot;patient&quot;), through a series of steps set out in ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and the accompanying ''Hubbard Dianetics Seminar'' work-book. The preclear's job is look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says, and controls the process so the preclear may put his full attention on a specific record of pain until he can be cheerful about it.

The auditor and preclear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps: &lt;ref&gt;This description is based on &quot;[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics® Procedure—10 Simple Steps]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The auditor assures the preclear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.

:2. The preclear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of &quot;dianetic reverie&quot;, signified by &quot;a tremble of the lashes&quot;. During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter. 

:3. The auditor installs a &quot;canceller&quot;, an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidently occur. This is done by saying &quot;In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?&quot;

:4. The auditor then asks the preclear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the preclear in his past: &quot;Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&quot;

:5. The preclear is invited by the auditor to &quot;Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.&quot;

:6a. The auditor instructs the preclear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times &quot;until the preclear is cheerful about it&quot;. 

:6b. When the preclear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the preclear to locate another incident: &quot;Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&quot; The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.

:7. The preclear is instructed to &quot;return to present time&quot;.

:8. The auditor checks to make sure that the preclear feels himself to be in &quot;present time&quot;, i.e. not still recalling a past incident.

:9. The auditor gives the preclear the canceller word: &quot;Very good. Cancelled.&quot;

:10. The auditor tells the preclear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: &quot;When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.&quot; (Snap!)

Auditing sessions are kept confidential. However, a few published transcripts of auditing sessions have been published with no confidential information included, as demonstration examples and are available for review. Some extracts can be found in Dr. J.A. Winter's book ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research &amp; Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the Congress Lecture series.

According to Hubbard, undertaking this activity will enable the preclear to &quot;contact&quot; and &quot;release&quot; engrams stored in the reactive mind. This is said to relieve the preclear of the physical and mental aberrations attributed to the presence of those engrams. The engrams consist of any painful events such as accidents and injuries earlier in life, and may contain unfortunate phrases uttered by others in the preclear's presence. For instance, Winter cites the example of a preclear's persistent [[headache]]s supposedly being traceable to a doctor saying &quot;Take him now&quot; during the preclear's birth. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard similarly claims that the cause of the blood cancer [[leukemia]] is traceable to &quot;an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The preclear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience and the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the preclear finds.  This is entirely up to the preclear.

The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that &quot;nothing could be could be cleared from the above dialog than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''[http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/e520000.htm Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]''. Dover, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]]&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;[http://home.snafu.de/tilman/j/hypnosis.html Never believe a hypnotist]&quot;, Jon Atack&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/crime-syndicate-used-hypnosis-dublin.htm Psychologist says church appeared to use hypnosis]&quot;, ''Irish Times'', [[13 March]] [[2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://lermanet.com/cisar/books/bdwopc2.htm The &quot;Scientology Organization&quot; (SO) as of July 2003]&quot;, chapter 2. Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Wuerttemberg, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;, although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/faq/pg005.html What is auditing?]&quot;, Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt; A further point advanced by critics is that those in a hypnotic state &amp;ndash; even only lightly so &amp;ndash; are more susceptible to suggestion. Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a preclear &quot;encourage fantasy&quot;, a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form [[False memory#discussion|false memories]]. The auditor is not supposed to make any assessment of whether a recalled memory is real or imaginary, or how accurate it is but seeks to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor Richard J. Ofshe, a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclears at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic [[suggestion]] &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.piratehaven.org/~atman/factnet/cust1e3.txt A Very Brief Overview of Scientology]&quot;, Richard E. Ofshe, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific evaluations==

Some of the [[psychometry|psychometric]] basis of Dianetics can be traced to the ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and was said to have used as a source. &lt;ref&gt;Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - &quot;His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Freud had speculated forty years previously that traumas with similar content join together in &quot;chains,&quot; embedded in the &quot;unconscious&quot; mind, causing irrational responses in the individual. According to Freud a &quot;chain&quot; would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, &quot;with an accompanying expression of emotion.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, &quot;Studies in Hysteria&quot;, Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Hogarth Press, London (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific literature records very few scientific evaluations having been conducted into the effectiveness and theoretical basis of Dianetics. Professor John A. Lee states in his evaluation of Dianetics:

:Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's physiological and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness. &lt;ref&gt;Lee, John A. ''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario ([http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/lee.html#evaluation Excerpt])&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two independent scientific studies are recorded in the [[MEDLINE]] database, both having been conducted in the 1950s by researchers at [[New York University]]:

* Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes on intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or upon the degree of personality conflicts. &lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Harvey Jay. &quot;Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality.&quot; Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])&lt;/ref&gt;

* Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it. &lt;ref&gt;Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. [http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test.html &quot;An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)&quot;]. ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of these studies has been questioned by Dianetics advocates, who have criticized the qualifications and methodology of the authors.

Hubbard claimed, in an interview with the ''New York Times'' in November 1950, that &quot;he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations. He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Psychologists Act Against Dianetics&quot;, New York Times,  [[September 9]] [[1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably in fulfillment of this pledge, in January 1951 the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results''. This booklet, written by Dalmyra Ibanex, Gordon and Peggy Southon and Peggy Benton, provides the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of X-ray plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured &quot;aberrations&quot; including [[manic depression]], asthma, arthritis, colitis and &quot;overt homosexuality&quot;. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (&quot;Case 1080A, R. L.&quot;). &lt;ref&gt;Benton, P; Ibanex, D.; Southon, G; Southon, P. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the survey including a chart of the Wechsler IQ test results and why the test was selected for adults, were included in editions of Hubbard's book ''Science of Survival'' until about the 1970s. Its scientific validity was contested at the time. It was discussed in an article in the June/July 1951 issue of the ''Rhodomagnetic Digest'', a science fiction fanzine, which expresses doubts about the validity of the psychometric tests used, the presentation of the results and the selection of the test subjects. It comments that the booklet &quot;use[s] unrecognized tests in an unorthodox way, the results being presented in a doubtful fashion.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Fabun, Don. &quot;An Analysis of the Dianetics Foundation Report&quot;, ''Rhodomagnetic Digest'', June/July 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authors of the survey do not provide any details of their own qualifications, although they are described in ''Science of Survival'' as psychotherapists. They are clearly strong supporters of Dianetics, raising the question of possible bias (it certainly cannot be described as an ''independent'' report). Notably, they appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without any consideration of whether other factors might have played a part; the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s, a key element of the [[scientific method]].

Several other evaluations of the scientific claims of Dianetics have been written by scientists and academics from various fields. Hubbard's book on Dianetics attracted some highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organisations. &lt;ref&gt;Many of these are reproduced at http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/ &lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychological Association passed a resolution calling &quot;attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/e500909.htm &quot;Psychologists Act Against Dianetics&quot;], ''New York Times'', [[September 9]] [[1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;

J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, wrote an account of his personal positive experiences with Dianetics but offered no scientific substantiation, criticizing the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake &quot;precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Also writing at the time, Don Fabun commented that &quot;there do not seem to be any acceptable facts and figures to show the results of Dianetic processing. Like the famous &quot;clears&quot; -- who strangely enough are never available for public appearance nor for orthodox psychometric tests -- the facts behind Dianetics appear to remain in the realm of pure faith.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Fabun, &quot;An Analysis of the Dianetics Foundation Report&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dianetics and pseudoscience==

Dianetics is regarded by mainstream science as a [[pseudoscience]] and has achieved no general acceptance as a ''bona fide'' [[scientific theory]], despite Hubbard's claims of scientific veracity. &lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.pubmed.gov PubMed] - other than a few reviews of Dianetics from 1950/51, Dianetics has barely been mentioned in medical journals.&lt;/ref&gt; For a theory to qualify as scientific it must be:

:* '''Consistent''' (internally and externally)
:* '''Parsimonious''' (sparing in proposed entities or explanations, see [[Occam's Razor]])
:* '''Useful''' (describes and explains observed phenomena)
:* '''Empirically testable &amp; falsifiable''' (see [[Falsifiability]])
:* '''Based upon multiple observations,''' often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments
:* '''Correctable &amp; dynamic''' (changes are made as new data are discovered)
:* '''Progressive''' (achieves all that previous theories have and more)
:* '''Provisional''' or tentative (admits that it might not be correct rather than asserting certainty) 

For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, but ideally all, of the above criteria. The fewer which are matched, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a couple or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. &lt;ref&gt;Bunce, M. (1984). &quot;What is pseudoscience?&quot; ''Skeptical Inquirer'', 9, 36-46&lt;/ref&gt; Typical objections to defining Dianetics as science are that it lacks consistency, violates the principle of parsimony, is not falsifiable, is not empirically testable in many of its aspects, is not based upon multiple observations and is not correctable, dynamic, tentative or progressive.

Many scientific voices, from 1950 through to the present day, have criticized Dianetics as a classic [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gardner, ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''; Bauer, ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'' and ''Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena, and Other Heterodoxies''; Corsini ''et al'', ''The Dictionary of Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy professor [[Robert Carroll]] points to a lack of scientific rigor and evidence:

:What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such &quot;data&quot; would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science. &lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html &quot;Dianetics&quot;], ''Skeptics Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. Sumner Davis]] similarly comments that 

:Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on hypotheses, which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some subconscious stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe. &lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. Sumner. ''Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World'', Writers Club Press, 2001 (ISBN 0595265235)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[cognitive science]] does not support Hubbard's concepts of engrams, mental image pictures and reactive minds. Unlike mainstream science, Dianetics does not appear to be correctable and dynamic. The book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' has not been updated since Hubbard wrote it in 1950 (although Hubbard did develop Dianetics further in later years). Moreover, the Church of Scientology has prohibited making changes to Hubbard's works even in the light of new data. In a [[1982]] directive, the Church of Scientology instructed that &quot;LRH ISSUES [''i.e. publications''] ARE TO BE LEFT INTACT AS ISSUED&quot; and &quot;no one except LRH&quot; was to change or cancel his publications. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Integrity of Source&quot;, Scientology Policy Directive 19 of [[July 7]] [[1982]]; cited in &quot;The Ultimate Spin Doctor: L. Ron Hubbard - The Man and His Myth&quot;, ''Watchman Expositor'' Vol. 13, No. 5, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard died in [[1986]], making changes to his works unlikely unless there is a change of Church policy. The mere disproving of his ideas is ''not'' regarded as valid grounds for making a change; the same directive states that &quot;the only occasion for any revision of an LRH issue is if a typographical error was found in the original.&quot; In this regard, Dianetics is perhaps closer in character to a belief system than a genuine science or even a pseudoscience.

Dianetics also does not appear to meet the criteria for scientific evidence used by most [[United States]] courts, the [[Daubert Standard]]. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in federal courts and most state courts. The four Daubert criteria are:

* The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified.
* The methods should preferably be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
* There should be a known rate of [[error]] that can be used in evaluating the results.
* The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.

Hubbard's engram concept may meet the first of the criteria but other ideas in Dianetics (such as the causal link between &quot;aberrations&quot; and physical ailments) are possibly untestable. Dianetics does not meet the other criteria; its methods have never been published in a peer-reviewed journal, its rate of error is unknown (though Hubbard claimed that it was an &quot;invariable cure&quot;) and its methods are not accepted within the mental health community. Other than some rebuffed submissions in 1950 and the two studies citied above, there is no indication that proponents of Dianetics have sought to engage with the scientific community to assess the validity of the concept.

==History==

===Origins===

Hubbard traced the origin of Dianetics to unpublished research that he claimed to have undertaken in the 1920s and 1930s, which culminated in the writing of a manuscript entitled ''Excalibur'' on the study of the mind. The manuscript was said to have been written in 1938 but was never published. However, Hubbard stated that most of what made up ''Excalibur'' had been released in his various published writings from the 1950s onwards. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;The Anatomy Of Thought&quot;. Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter [[26 April]] [[1970]]R, revised [[15 March]] [[1975]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which Hubbard served in the [[United States Navy]], he was admitted to the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in [[San Diego]]. The Church of Scientology (and Hubbard himself) claims that this was due to his having been left &quot;partially blind with injured optic nerves and lame from hip and back injuries&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lronhubbardprofile.org/chron5.htm ''L. Ron Hubbard, a Profile'']. L. Ron Hubbard Library, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, a medical examination performed in September 1945 records that he was suffering from poor eyesight (which was corrected with glasses) and a recurrent [[duodenal ulcer]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/warhero/1945/450910.gif &quot;Report of medical survey&quot;], [[September 10]] [[1945]].&lt;/ref&gt;; there is no record of any physical injuries in his medical files, which also specifically stated that he had suffered no combat injuries. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/warhero/crippled.htm#doc-i &quot;Report of physical examination&quot;], [[September 19]] [[1945]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Oak Knoll, Hubbard claimed to have carried out research into [[endocrinology]] &quot;to determine whether or not structure monitors function or function monitors structure ... using nothing but Freudian Psychoanalysis and using a park bench as a consulting room.&quot; He claimed that during his stay at the hospital - supposedly a year long &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;The Story of Dianetics &amp; Scientology&quot;, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; but actually only three months according to his medical record - he spent a great deal of time in the hospital's library. He would certainly have been exposed there to the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and other psychoanalysts, but claimed to have had a long-time knowledge of Freudian thought due to a childhood friendship with a doctor who had been a student of Freud. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/founder/pg004.html &quot;L. Ron Hubbard: Early Studies of the Mind&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of Dianetics===

In January 1949, he wrote to his literary agent, [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], to inform him that he was writing a book on the &quot;cause and cure of nervous tension&quot;, which he was going to call either ''The Dark Sword'' or ''Excalibur'' or ''Science of the Mind''. He was enthusiastic about the prospect, claiming that the book would have &quot;more selling and publicity angles than any book of which I have ever heard.&quot; He announced his project to the general public in the same month, telling ''Writers' Markets and Methods'' magazine that he was working on a &quot;book of psychology&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Russell Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'', p. 144. Joseph, London (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to the Gerontological Society at Baltimore City Hospital to inform them that he had &quot;apparently made certain discoveries which seem to indicate they would have a definite effect on longevity.&quot; He stated that he was preparing a paper with the somewhat unwieldy title of ''Certain Discoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early Traumatic Experiences Including Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Illnesses and Accidents with an Examination of their Effects Physiological and Psychological and their Potential Influence on Longevity on the Adult Individual with an Account of the Techniques Evolved and Employed''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page14.htm &quot;Letters from the Birth of Dianetics - L. Ron Hubbard - The Dianetics Letters&quot;], Church of Scientology International.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a June 1954 biographical note issued by the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists]], Hubbard's letter was &quot;politely received&quot; but the Society apparently declined to become involved with his work. He is said also to have written to the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page14.htm &quot;Ron the Philosopher: The Birth of Dianetics&quot;], Church of Scientology International &lt;/ref&gt; These letters, and their responses, have not been published, though Hubbard later said that they had been negative &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page75.htm &quot;My Only Defense For Having Lived&quot;], 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some time apparently in the first half of 1949, Hubbard told his friend [[John W. Campbell]], the editor of [[Astounding Magazine|''Astounding Science Fiction'' magazine]] and publisher of many of Hubbard's short stories, about the work that he had been doing on Dianetics. Campbell had been one of Hubbard's early test subjects and believed that his persistent [[sinusitis]] had been cured by Hubbard's techniques. He became an enthusiastic supporter of Hubbard's work. In a letter to one of ''Astounding's'' contributors, Jack Williamson, he wrote: &quot;I know dianetics is one of, if not the greatest, discovery of all Man's written and unwritten history. It produces the sort of stability and sanity men have dreamed about for centuries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Jack Williamson, ''Wonder's Child: my life in science fiction''. Bluejay Books, New York (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1949, Campbell wrote to one of ''Astounding's'' regular contributors, Dr. [[Joseph A. Winter]], a medical doctor who lived in [[Michigan]]. Winter was intrigued by Campbell's claims about Hubbard's work:

:With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, he [Hubbard] has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses - in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Winter was initially skeptical, Hubbard wrote what he called &quot;an operator's manual for your use&quot; which convinced Winter that Dianetics had some promise. In October 1949, he travelled to Hubbard's home at [[Bay Head, New Jersey]] where he joined Hubbard and Campbell to work on the development of Dianetics, an event referred to elliptically by Hubbard in a letter published by the Church of Scientology (&quot;there are a couple of writers staying here ... They just stopped by for dinner one night around the first of October.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page18.htm letter to Russell Hays of [[November 14]] [[1949]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter attempted to interest some medical colleagues and psychiatrists in Dianetics but elicited little interest. He suggested to Hubbard that he should try to publish an article on Dianetics to stimulate interest in his work. Perhaps mindful of the rejection of his earlier efforts, Hubbard told Winter that &quot;the articles you suggest would be more acceptable coming from another pen than mine.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, some time in November or December 1949, Winter wrote a paper &quot;giving a brief resumé of the principles and methodology of dianetic therapy&quot; which he submitted informally to an editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association''. However, the editor told Winter that &quot;the paper as written did not contain sufficient evidence of efficacy to be acceptable and was, moreover, better suited to one of the journals which dealt with psychotherapy.&quot; He revised the paper, added case histories provided by Hubbard, and submitted it to the ''American Journal of Psychiatry''. However, it was again rejected on the grounds of insufficient evidence. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether Hubbard and Winter independently approached the two journals at different times, or whether there was just the one approach in 1949. Hubbard claims that in 1947 &quot;it seemed that a public presentation of this material was in order and an effort was made to present it to the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Universes&quot;, lecture of [[April 6]] [[1954]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Church of Scientology sources give the date as 1948 and 1949. 

According to the Church of Scientology, in 1948 Hubbard issued his early research in the form of a manuscript entitled ''Dianetics: The Original Thesis''. It received a wider public release in 1951 and is now published as the book ''[[The Dynamics of Life]]''. However, Hubbard himself said that the manuscript was issued in 1949 &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Dianetics: its background&quot;. HCO Bulletin of [[May 22]] [[1969]]&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Auditor attitude and the bank&quot;, lecture of [[October 10]] [[1969]]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is not clear what this manuscript originally contained - the original text is not available for comparison with the 1951 publication - but it may have comprised the &quot;operator's manual&quot; written by Hubbard for Winter. The dates given by Hubbard and Winter certainly coincide, and the &quot;operator's manual&quot; of mid-1949 is the first independently attested codification of Dianetics. Winter writes that he made a number of copies of it and passed them to friends and colleagues, and it would not have been surprising if Campbell had done the same. Hubbard later spoke of how he had &quot;handed out copies in a hectographed, mimeographed way to people who were cursorily interested who wanted to know what I had been doing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;How we have addressed the problem of the mind&quot;, lecture of [[July 4]] [[1957]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dianetics in print===

At the end of 1949, Hubbard and Campbell agreed that Dianetics would be announced through an article to be printed in ''Astounding'' the following May, which would be followed shortly afterwards by the publication of a full-length book. Campbell arranged for Hermitage House, a small [[New York]] medical and psychiatric textbook publisher, to publish the book. 

Dianetics was trailed in &quot;Terra Incognita: The Mind&quot;, an article by Hubbard that was published in the winter 1949-spring 1950 edition of ''The Explorers Journal''. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ &quot;Terra Incognita: The Mind&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics was clearly not quite finished - at this stage, engrams were called ''comanomes'', a [[neologism]] proposed by Winter that was later abandoned.

In April 1950, Hubbard, Campbell, Winter and several others established a Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication. Hubbard wrote ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' around the same time, claiming to have taken only six weeks to do so &lt;ref&gt;&quot;L.R.H. Biography&quot;, Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, [[October 31]] [[1977]]&lt;/ref&gt; (though according to another Scientology source he wrote all 180,000 words in only three weeks &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Child Dianetics'', p. 178. Publications Organization Worldwide, Edinburgh (1968 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;).

Dianetics was launched in the May 1950 issue of ''Astounding'' (published in April 1950), and the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' was published on [[9 May]] 1950. It became an immediate best-seller, with the first run of 8,000 copies quickly selling out. Only two months after the book's publication, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine reported that over 55,000 copies had been sold and enthusiasts had established 500 Dianetics clubs across the United States. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/e500821.htm &quot;BOOKS Industry: Best Seller&quot;], ''Newsweek'', No. 36, August 1950&lt;/ref&gt; John W. Campbell reported in the August 1950 edition of ''Astounding Science Fiction'' that the magazine was receiving up to a thousand letters a week about Dianetics. Sales reached 150,000 copies by the end of the year.

The popularity of Dianetics was due to a number of factors. Campbell's endorsement was invaluable to its success. ''Astounding Science Fiction'' had over 150,000 readers, many of whom were familiar with Hubbard's earlier [[science fiction]] and had a strong interest in new scientific discoveries (according to Winter, 80% were college graduates). Among the wider population, Dianetics gained popularity as a cheaper, simpler and apparently more effective means of self-improvement than conventional psychotherapies. Hubbard's optimistic view that Dianetics could alleviate the Cold War climate of tension and fear also struck a chord. One of his supporters, Frederick Schuman, wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that &quot;History has become a race between Dianetics and catastrophe&quot;. 

The success of Dianetics brought in a flood of money. Hubbard offered teaching courses for Dianetic &quot;auditors&quot; though the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, costing $500 per person. This bought four to six weeks of instruction, plus thirty-six hours of Dianetic therapy. The president of Hermitage House, the publisher of ''Dianetics'', reported in the August 1950 issue of ''Astounding'' that the book was selling a thousand copies a day (at $4 each) and all 100 special leather-bound copies (at $25 each) had already sold, with all proceeds going to the Dianetic Foundation. Hubbard recruited his friend and fellow science fiction writer [[A. E. Van Vogt]] to act as the Foundation's treasurer, and five other Foundations were soon established in [[Washington, DC]], [[New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Honolulu]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/1950-look.html &quot;Dianetics: Science or Hoax?&quot;], ''Look'', [[December 5]] [[1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the Foundation's income at the time can be judged by the fact that its Los Angeles property was valued at $4.5 million. &lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Dianetics===

The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, which received a mixture of bemused, concerned and denunciatory reviews in the US media.  Nobel-prize winning physicist [[Isidor Isaac Rabi|I.I. Rabi]], reviewing ''Dianetics'' for ''[[Scientific American]]'', declared that &quot;this volume probably contains more promises and less evidence per page than has any publication since the invention of printing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/e500814.htm &quot;The Dianetics Craze&quot;], ''The New Republic'', [[August 14]] [[1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Nation'' also pointed to the lack of documentation provided by Hubbard in ''Dianetics'': &quot;No case histories are offered to substantiate his claims, nor is there documentation of any kind to indicate that any previous thinker, medical or otherwise, ever made a significant contribution to the subject of human behavior.&quot; Similarly, the ''Individual Psychology Bulletin'' criticized Hubbard for &quot;not offer[ing] any other evidence than a vague reference to hundreds of cured patients, without furnishing case histories or other specific data. The book is crammed with bragging and swaggering, pseudoscientific bombast, platitudes and vulgarities, and a great deal of sheer nonsense.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Deutsch, ''Individual Psychology Bulletin'', 9:1 (1951) p.38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New Republic'' noted that the publication of ''Dianetics'' had coincided with that of ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'', a notorious work of pseudoscience by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], with which ''Dianetics'' shared the top of the best-seller lists. This, its writer said, illustrated &quot;the most frightening proof of the confusion of the contemporary mind and its tendency to fall prey to pseudo-scientific concepts.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Isaac Isidor Rabi, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/fifties/e510100.htm Review of Dianetics], ''Scientific American'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers expressed concern at the possible dangers of unskilled amateurs practicing therapy on patients, and skepticism about Hubbard's claims that Dianetics could be effective in dealing with illnesses.

In September 1950, the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a resolution calling on psychologists not to use Hubbard's methods for treatment purposes unless and until they had been shown effective through scientific testing. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/about/division/cpmscientific.html#4 &quot;M. Scientific Affairs - IV. DIANETICS&quot;], ''APA Council Policy Manual'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of localities, complaints were made against Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.

Hubbard later claimed that the [[United States Government]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[American Communist Party]] had sought to take over Dianetics and had orchestrated opposition to it. He claimed that &quot;just about the time [Dianetics] hit the stands&quot; (i.e. April-May 1950), a &quot;very high-ranking officer&quot; of the US Navy had approached him to sound him out about &quot;using what you know about the mind to make people more suggestible.&quot; Hubbard was apparently able to avoid this by resigning from the Navy. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;The National Academy of American Psychology&quot;, lecture of [[31 December]] [[1957]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his letter of resignation from the Navy, dated [[May 27]] [[1950]], makes no mention of this; he said merely that he &quot;sometimes must write on technical subjects and while these have no bearing on naval matters or government security of any kind I would feel much freer were I not a commissioned officer in the naval reserve.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.lermanet.com/L_Ron_Hubbard/mr177.htm letter of resignation from the US Navy], [[May 27]] [[1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Hubbard claimed that the [[Soviet Union]] had also tried to co-opt him to develop Dianetics. He told the FBI in an interview that &quot;the Soviets apparently realized the value of Dianetics because as early as 1938 an official of Amtorg [the Soviet-run American Trade Organization], while at The Explorers Club in New York, contacted him to suggest that he go to Russia and develop Dianetics there.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;US Govt memo 62-116151-70, [[March 7]] [[1951]]&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI agent conducting the interview was not convinced, describing Hubbard as &quot;a mental case.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Letter in FBI files, [[March 10]] [[1951]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard also claimed that the [[American Communist Party]] had sought to take over Dianetics, and blamed the hostile press coverage on a Communist plot. The [[Authors League of America]], which represented American authors and playwrights, was &quot;100 percent, almost, Communist Party card-carrying members.&quot; According to Hubbard,

:These people in the early days of Dianetics said, &quot;We can use Dianetics.&quot; They were all my friends. Everywhere I looked, every writer I knew who had ever been a member of the Communist Party was right there alongside of me pumping my hand, saying, &quot;Good going, Ron. We knew you had it in you.&quot; ... We had the potential of an organization the influence of which could be used by another interest! And when they finally got it through their thick skulls in October of 1950 that I didn't care to have Dianetics and Scientology covertly used by any other organization on Earth for their own special purposes, Dianetics and Scientology in the public presses had it. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Final Lecture&quot;, lecture of [[November 8]] [[1959]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as (in his view) it secretly controlled the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union and &quot;nearly every government in the world&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Ron's Journal 67&quot;, taped message of [[September 20]] [[1967]]&lt;/ref&gt; This view is still put forward by the Church of Scientology, for instance in a 1993 speech by Church head [[David Miscavige]]:

:But the whole world knows of Dianetics. It was the concern that this very popularity might occur that drove the psychs mad in 1950.

:At stake were all of their vested interest dollars. How could they get research grants? Millions, or even billions - if the problems of the mind were already solved? And how could they hide the fact of LRH's discoveries if the whole country was talking about them? Their initial attacks have been mentioned over the years by us. First they got &quot;technical reviews&quot; by psychiatrists hatcheting Dianetics. They published these critical reviews in their psychiatric trade magazines ... Then they took these published reviews and handed them out to the press where they were promptly requoted as authority in magazines like &quot;Slime&quot; and &quot;Tripe&quot; [i.e. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' and ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'']. &lt;ref&gt;David Miscavige, speech to the [[International Association of Scientologists]], [[October 8]] [[1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragmentation and transformation===

By the autumn of 1950, Dianetics was beginning to run into serious problems. Revenue was still received from book sales, lectures and auditor training, but financial controls seem to have been lax. Hubbard said that &quot;We had taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars, all told, and it's something on the accounting system of dumping it all in a barrel outside the door and hauling the barrel down to a bank every once in a while - just grim, the accounting just horrible!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Review of progress of Dianetics and dianetic business&quot;, lecture of [[25 February]] [[1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of those involved in Dianetics at the time, Helen O'Brien, claimed that a member of the Elizabeth, NJ Dianetic Foundation resigned after it emerged that only $20,000 of the Foundation's $90,000 income one month could be accounted for. Hubbard's treasurer, A. E. van Vogt, has said that Hubbard personally withdrew large sums from Foundation accounts, apparently without any prior notice or explanation of his purpose. &lt;ref&gt;A.E. van Vogt interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;  He calculated that by November 1950 the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt. He attempted to rein in costs by cutting staff, but was overruled by Hubbard. &lt;ref&gt;''Dianetics and the Professions'', A.E. van Vogt, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters were made worse by the Foundation's expensive research program, for which a 110-room building was bought on Rossmore Avenue, Los Angeles. Hubbard believed that a cocktail of [[benzedrine]], [[vitamins]] and [[glutamic acid]] - which he termed GUK after the rifle cleaning fluid used by the [[US Marine Corps]] - would provide a chemical alternative to auditing. &lt;ref&gt;Forrest Ackerman interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Winter writes that it proved a &quot;dismal, expensive failure.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements had emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members were becoming strained. Hubbard's interest in [[past lives]] was a particular cause of tension, as he noted in a lengthy footnote in his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival]]'':

:The subject of past deaths and past lives is so full of tension that as early as last July (1950-Ed) the board of trustees of the Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning the entire subject. And I have been many times requested to omit any reference to these in the present work or in public for fear that a general impression would get out that Dianetics had something to do with spiritualism. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Science of Survival'', footnote p. 61. Hubbard College of Scientology, East Grinstead (1967 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

He later claimed that &quot;The reason the first Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation had trouble was that its Board of Directors attempted to stop past lives from being run.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Dianetics Today'', p. 353. Church of Scientology of California, Los Angeles (1975 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter recorded his dissatisfaction with what he regarded as a &quot;divergen[ce] from my views as to what constituted a serious scientific organization.&quot; He took the view that &quot;Foundation dianetics was becoming crystallized, ritualistic and sterile&quot;, characterized by a &quot;none-too-subtle antagonism towards the medical profession in general and the psychiatric field in particular.&quot; He commented that &quot;any attempts to force the medical profession to accept it solely on the basis of the affirmation, &quot;It works!&quot; and deriding those who request more conclusive proof, is more than likely to jeopardize whatever possible benefits there might be.&quot; Having been rebuffed in his attempts to steer the Foundation onto &quot;a more reasoned and conservative basis&quot;, he resigned in October 1950. &lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'' pp. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the Foundation's board of directors also fell out with Hubbard. Art Ceppos, the publisher of ''Dianetics'', also resigned at the same time as Winter and later published Winter's critical book on Dianetics. This breach led to problems in obtaining fresh copies of ''Dianetics'', as a new publisher had to be found. Shortly afterwards, the general counsel of the Dianetic Foundation in Elizabeth contacted the FBI and alleged that Ceppos was a Communist sympathizer who had recently tried to get hold of the Foundation's mailing list of sixteen thousand names which would be &quot;valuable to anyone interested in circulating Communist party literature&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-100.html Letter to Director FBI from SAC Newark], [[March 21]] [[1951]]&lt;/ref&gt;

John W. Campbell likewise became dissatisfied. He criticized Hubbard for &quot;dogmatism and authoritarianism&quot; after the latter began to insist that only a Hubbard-approved &quot;Standard Procedure&quot; of Dianetics be used. Methods that Hubbard had not approved were condemned as being dangerous &quot;Black Dianetics.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, letter in ''The Arc Light'', 25 (May 1952), pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a marked break from Hubbard's previously liberal policy, in which he had rejected as illegitimate any attempt to monopolise Dianetics. Campbell resigned from the board in March 1951. Although he remained interested in Dianetics for several years afterwards, he eventually moved on to other causes.

A particularly serious breach occurred with Hubbard's wife Sara, the Foundation's librarian and formerly his personal auditor and research subject. Barbara Klowdan, his public relations assistant, described how Hubbard and his wife had both had affairs with other people as they became estranged from each other - Hubbard with Klowdan, and Sara with Miles Hollister, a Dianetics instructor in Los Angeles. Sara was suspended from the Foundation's board of directors and her official post. On [[March 3]] [[1951]], Hubbard wrote to the FBI to denounce Sara and Hollister as &quot;Communist Party members or suspects&quot;, describing Hollister as having a &quot;broad forehead, rather Slavic.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-89.html letter to FBI of [[March 3]] [[1951]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sara filed divorce papers on [[March 23]] [[1951]] which attracted widespread media interest due to her claims of &quot;systematic torture&quot; allegedly suffered at Hubbard's hands. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dianetics Inventor Sued for Divorce, Wife's Complaint Charges He Subjected Her To 'Scientific Torture Experiments'&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', [[April 24]] [[1951]]&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Hubbard wrote to the FBI to accuse Sara of involvement in a supposed assassination attempt in which &quot;I was knocked out, had a needle thrust into my heart to give it a jet of air to produce &quot;coronary thrombosis&quot; and was given an electric shock with a 110 volt current.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-110.html letter to FBI of [[May 14]] [[1951]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard later characterized the suit as &quot;a gal I wasn't even married to was suing me for divorce.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;SOP 5 long form step III - spacation&quot;, lecture of [[January 19]] [[1953]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard appears to have believed that his organization was under sustained attack from Communist interests. From [[March 2]] [[1951]], all employees of the Dianetic Foundations were to be &quot;requested to sign a strong oath of loyalty to the U.S. government, a denial of Communism and that their fingerprints be taken and forwarded to the F.B.I.&quot; He asserted that Ceppos was &quot;connected with Communists&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-92.html Memo from F. J. Baumgardner to M.H. Holm], [[March 7]] [[1951]]&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed that Winter was a &quot;psycho-neurotic discharged officer of the US Army Medical Corps and that Winter seemed to have Communist connections.&quot; He complained that &quot;the Communist Party or members of the Communist Party have in the past year wiped out a half a million operation for me, have cost me my health and have considerably retarded material of interest to the United States Government.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-110.html letter to FBI of [[May 14]] [[1951]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet more financial problems were caused in January 1951 when the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, accusing it of teaching medicine without a licence. &lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; This forced the foundation to close its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated. Perhaps as a result of this lawsuit, the Foundation's creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts, worsening its financial plight.

===Dianetics in Kansas===

A temporary respite was provided in April 1951 by Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]]. A Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation was established at Wichita with Purcell's financial backing. Purcell also funded the printing of a new edition of ''Dianetics'' and several new Dianetics books - ''[[Self Analysis]]'', ''[[Science of Survival]]'', ''[[Notes on the Lectures of L. Ron Hubbard]]'', ''[[Advanced Procedure and Axioms]]'' and ''[[Child Dianetics]]'' - as well as a range of other Dianetics pamphlets and publications. 

However, the Wichita Foundation soon ran into problems. The other Foundations collapsed under the weight of unpaid debts and creditors pursued the new Foundation, which was &quot;consistently and continually hit by slopovers from the old Foundations, where the bookkeeping is bad&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Review of progress of Dianetics and dianetic business&quot;, lecture of [[25 February]] [[1952]]&lt;/ref&gt; The income of the Wichita Foundation was far more modest than the earlier Foundations had enjoyed, illustrating how public interest in Dianetics had waned by this time. According to Helen O'Brien, who worked with Hubbard in Wichita, only 112 people attended the first major conference held at Wichita and only 51 students attended a subsequent lecture series in October 1951. &lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Helen. ''Dianetics in Limbo''. Whitmore, Philadelphia (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing at the time, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] observed that &quot;the dianetics craze seems to have burned itself out as quickly as it caught fire&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

The creditors caught up with the Wichita Foundation in early 1952 and forced it into bankruptcy. Hubbard sold his holdings to Purcell for a nominal sum and established a &quot;Hubbard College&quot; on the other side of Wichita, leaving Purcell to sort out the bankruptcy proceedings. The Purcell-run Foundation sent its members a set of accounts showing that it had earned $141,821 but was overspent by $63,222. &lt;ref&gt;Purcell circular letter of [[May 21]] [[1952]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard responded angrily, accusing Purcell of having been paid $500,000 by the American Medical Association to wreck Dianetics. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Anatomy of the Theta Body&quot;, lecture of March 1952&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that Purcell had been funded by the Communist Party of America &quot;to do in a Central Organization.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;E-meter&quot;, lecture of [[May 19]] [[1961]]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the collapse of the Wichita Foundation, the remaining assets of the Foundation were put up for auction. They largely comprised of the copyright of all the tapes, books, techniques, processes and paraphernalia of Dianetics, including the name. Purcell bought the assets outright, but Hubbard's financial straits were not improved. One of his staff, James Elliot, sent out an appeal on his behalf: &quot;Dianetics and Mr. Hubbard have been dealt a blow from which they cannot recover .... Somehow Mr. Hubbard must get funds to keep Dianetics from being closed down everywhere .... He is penniless.&quot; Elliot wrote of Hubbard's wish to establish a &quot;free school in Phoenix for the rehabilitation of auditors.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Elliot, James. Circular letter of [[April 21]] [[1952]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was launched around April 1952 as the Hubbard Association of Scientologists; he could no longer use the name &quot;Dianetics&quot; as it no longer belonged to him.

However, he was unable to escape entirely the problems of the bankrupt Wichita Foundation; on [[December 16]] [[1952]], he was arrested in the middle of a lecture for failing to return $9,000 withdrawn from the Wichita Foundation. He eventually settled the debt by paying $1,000 and returning a car that had been loaned by Purcell. &lt;ref&gt;Atack, Jon. &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot;, p. 135. Lyle Stuart, London (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Purcell finally tired of pursuing Hubbard over the bankruptcy and handed back the Dianetics copyrights in 1954. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dianetics and Scientology Organizations United Again&quot;, ''The Journal of Scientology'', issue 36-G, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Dianetics to Scientology===

Dianetics provided the seed from which the philosophical framework of [[Scientology]] grew.  Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as &quot;Book One&quot;. Hubbard himself regarded its publication as such an important event that he created his own calendar based on the publication date of ''Dianetics'', dating his Scientology writings from that time. For instance, Hubbard uses &quot;A.D. 13&quot; to mean 1963 &amp;ndash; literally &quot;year 13 After Dianetics&quot;.

In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as &quot;Scientology, a [[religious philosophy]]&quot;. Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas. The stated goal of Scientology is to fully rehabilitate the spiritual nature of an individual, including rehabilitating all abilities and realizing one's full potential. By contrast, the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind and become [[Clear (Scientology)|&quot;Clear&quot;]].  

In 1978, Hubbard revised and to some extent relaunched Dianetics as &quot;New Era Dianetics&quot;. This was supposed to achieve better results than the original Dianetics, and much more quickly; &quot;Preclears who might have needed over 2,000 hours of auditing to achieve the highest results obtainable from 1950 technology might now achieve comparable gains in a tenth of that time with modern Dianetics and Scientology auditing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neweradianetics.org.uk/page03.htm &quot;About New Era Dianetics Auditing&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Church of Scientology]] practices and disseminates both the original Dianetics and New Era Dianetics, and views Dianetics as an introduction to Scientology. As of 2001, the Church of Scientology continued to run [[television]] [[advertising | advertisements]] promoting ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health''. [[Time Magazine]], in 1991, alleged that the Church asked its members to purchase large quantities of the book with their own money, or with money supplied by the Church, for the sole purpose of keeping the book on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]]. &lt;ref&gt;Behar, Richard.

      <comment>Added information on real v. virtual Data Warehouses</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''data warehouse''' is a logical collection of information gathered from many different operational databases used to create business intelligence that supports business analysis activities and decision-making tasks, primarily, a record of an enterprise's past transactional and operational information, stored in a [[database]] [[database design|designed]] to favour efficient data analysis and reporting (especially [[OLAP]]). Genearlly, data warehousing is not meant for current &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; data, although 'virtual' or 'point-to-point' data warehouses can access operational data. A 'real' data warehouse is generally prefered to a virtual DW because stored data has been validated and is set up to provide reliable results to common types of queries used in a business.  

== History of data warehousing ==

In the 1990's as organizations of scale began to need more timely data about their business, they found that traditional information systems technology was simply too cumbersome to provide relevant data efficiently and quickly.  Completing reporting requests could take days or weeks using antiquated reporting tools that were designed more or less to 'execute' the business rather than 'run' the business.  

From this idea, the data warehouse was born as a place where relevant data could be held for completing strategic reports for management.  The key here is the word 'strategic' as most executives were less concerned with the day to day operations than they were with a more overall look at the model and business functions.

As with all technology, over the course of the latter half of the 20th century, we saw increased numbers and types of databases.  Many large businesses found themselves with data scattered across multiple platforms and variations of technology, making it almost impossible for any one individual to use data from multiple sources.  A key idea within data warehousing is to take data from multiple platforms/technologies (As varied as spreadsheets, DB2 databases, IDMS records, and VSAM files) and place them in a common location that uses a common querying tool.  In this way operational databases could be held on whatever system was most efficient for the operational business, while the reporting / strategic information could be held in a common location using a common language.  Data Warehouses take this even a step farther by giving the data itself commonality by defining what each term means and keeping it standard.  (An example of this would be gender which can be referred to in many ways, but should be standardized on a data warehouse with one common way of referring to each sex).

All of this was designed to make decision support more readily available and without affecting day to day operations.  One aspect of a data warehouse that should be stressed is that it is NOT a location for ALL of a businesses data, but rather a location for data that is 'interesting'.  Data that is interesting will assist decision makers in making strategic decisions relative to the organization's overall mission.

== Design of data warehouses ==
Data warehouses often hold large amounts of [[information]] which are sometimes subdivided into smaller logical units called [[data mart|dependent data marts]]. Dependent Datamarts allow for easier reporting by keeping relevant data together in one location.  

Usually, two basic ideas guide the creation of a data warehouse:
* '''Integration''' of data from distributed and differently structured databases, which facilitates a global overview and comprehensive analysis in the data warehouse.
* '''Separation''' of data used in daily operations from data used in the data warehouse for purposes of reporting, decision support, analysis and controlling.

Periodically, one imports [[data]] from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems and other related business software systems into the data warehouse for further processing. It is common practice to &quot;stage&quot; [[data]] prior to merging it into a data warehouse. In this sense, to &quot;stage data&quot; means to queue it for preprocessing, usually with an [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] tool. The preprocessing program reads the staged data (often a [[business]]'s primary [[OLTP]] databases), performs qualitative preprocessing or filtering (including [[denormalization]], if deemed necessary), and writes it into the warehouse.

=== Dimensions and measures ===

A data warehouse is created by analyzing ways to categorize data using [[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] and ways to summarize data using [[measure (data warehouse)|measures]].  Dimensions can be used to filter data by excluding results or by displaying data in different cells of a presentation.  Measures are used to create averages and totals using precomputed aggregates.

== Reporting ==

[[Business Intelligence]] reports (e.g., [[Management Information Systems|MIS]] reports) may then be generated from the data managed by the warehouse. In this way the data warehouse supplies the data for and supports the business intelligence tools that an organization might use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Disambiguation: &quot;Devonian&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the [[Southwestern Brythonic language]], and the people of the county of [[Devon]] are sometimes referred to as &quot;Devonians&quot;''

The '''Devonian''' is a [[geologic period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] era.  It is named after [[Devon]], [[England]], where rocks from this period were first studied. 

During the Devonian Period the first [[fish]] evolved [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]] and started to [[Landform|walk on land]] as [[amphibian]]s, and the first [[arthropod]]s like [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s also started to colonize terrestrial [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. The first [[gymnosperm|seed-bearing plants]] spread across dry land, forming huge [[forest]]s. In the [[ocean]]s, fish diversified into the first [[shark]]s, and the first [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned]] and [[bony fish]]. The first [[ammonite]] [[mollusk]]s appeared, and [[trilobite]]s, the mollusc-like [[brachiopod]]s, as well as great [[coral reef]]s were still common. The [[Late Devonian extinction]] severely affected marine life. The [[paleogeography]] was dominated by the [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] to the south, the [[continent]] of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the north, and the early formation of the small supercontinent of [[Euramerica]] in the middle. 

{{Paleozoic Footer}}

==Naming==
The period is named after [[Devon]], England where Devonian outcrops are common. While the [[stratum|rock bed]]s that define the start and end of the period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] ([[#References|Ogg, 2004]]), the Devonian extends from the end of the [[Silurian]] Period 416.0 ± 2.8 [[million years ago]] (Mya), to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]] Period 359.2 ± 2.5 Mya (in [[North America]], the beginning of the [[Mississippian]] subperiod of the Carboniferous) (ICS 2004). 

The Devonian is also known as the '''Age of Fishes''', but the term is out of favor. While fish underwent a major radiation it was only one of several major [[evolution]]ary landmarks during the period, and other lifeforms were more common. 

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterized as a '''Greenhouse Age''',   due to [[sampling bias]]: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the [[stratum|strata]] of [[western Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], which at the time straddled the [[Equator]] as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where [[fossil]] signatures of widespread reefs indicate  tropical  [[climate]]s that warm and moderately humid.

Even more rarely the Devonian is also known as the '''Old Red Age''', after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in Britain as the &quot;[[Old Red Sandstone]]&quot; in which these early discoveries were found.

==Devonian subdivisions==
The Devonian is usually broken into lower, middle, and upper subdivisions. The [[faunal stage]]s from youngest to oldest are: 

===Upper (most recent)===
*[[Famennian|Famennian/Chautauquan/Canadaway/Conneaut/Conneautan/Conewango/Conewangan]]
*[[Frasnian|Frasnian/Senecan/Sonyea/Sonyean/West Falls]]

===Middle===
*[[Cazenovian|Caenovia/Cazenovian]]
*[[Givetian|Givetian/Erian/Senecan/Tioughniogan/Tioughnioga/Taghanic/Taghanican/Genesee/Geneseean]]
*[[Eifelian|Eifelian/Southwood]]

===Lower (oldest)===
*[[Helderberg]]
*[[Emsian|Emsian/Sawkill/Deer Park]]
*[[Pragian|Pragian/Siegenian]]
*[[Lochkovian|Lochkovian/Gedinnian]]

Devonian rocks are oil and gas producers in some areas.

==Devonian palaeogeography==
The Devonian period was a time of great [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity, as [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]]land drew closer together. The continent [[Euramerica]] (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]], which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Cancer]], which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great airmasses, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[Ferrel cell]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions.

Near the [[equator]], [[Pangaea]] began to consolidate from the [[Tectonic plates|plate]]s containing [[North America]] and [[Europe]], further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonide orogeny|Caledonides]] in [[Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]].  The west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, in today's Idaho and Nevada; an approaching volcanic [[island arc]] reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode of Mississippian times called the [[Antler orogeny]] [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html].  cj is agy

The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the [[supercontinent]] of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas, where tropical [[reef]] organisms lived. The deep, enormous [[Panthalassa]] (the &quot;universal ocean&quot;) covered the rest of the [[planet]].

==Devonian fauna==
[[Image:Trilobite Ductina.jpg|thumb|Fossil trilobite ''Ductina vietnamica'' from the Devonian of China]]
===Marine biota===
Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopoda|brachiopods]] and [[coral|corals]]. Lily-like [[crinoid]]s were abundant, and [[trilobites]] were still fairly common, but less diverse than in earlier periods. The [[ostracoderm]]s were joined in the mid-Devonian by the first jawed [[fish]]es, the great armored [[placoderm]]s, as well as the first [[shark]]s and [[ray-finned fish]]. The first shark, the ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonion period. They became abundant and diverse. In the late Devonian the [[lobe-finned fish]] appeared, giving rise to the first [[tetrapod]]s.

===Reefs===
A great barrier reef, now left high and dry in the [[Kimberley Basin]] of northwest [[Australia]], once extended a thousand kilometers, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various [[carbonate]]-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous [[algae]]. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatopore|stromatoporoids]], and tabulate and [[Rugosa|rugose corals]], in that order of importance.

===Terrestrial biota===
By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The [[bacterium|bacteria]]l and algal mats were joined early in the period by primitive [[plant]]s that created the first recognizable [[soil]]s and harbored some [[arthropod]]s like [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[myriapod]]s. Early Devonian plants did not have roots or leaves like the plants most common today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They probably spread largely by vegetative growth, and did not grow much more than a few centimeters tall. 

By the late Devonian, forests of small, primitive plants existed: [[lycophyte]]s, sphenophytes, [[fern]]s, and progymnosperms had [[Evolution|evolved]]. Most of these plants have true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The tree-like ancestral fern ''[[Archaeopteris]]'', grew as a large tree with true [[wood]]. These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the &quot;Devonian Explosion&quot;. The primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of [[insect]]s and seed-plants that characterizes a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the late Devonian.

The 'greening' of the continents acted as a [[carbon dioxide]] [[sink]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] levels of this [[greenhouse gas]] may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive [[extinction event]]. see [[Late Devonian extinction]].

Also in the Devonian, both [[vertebrate]]s and arthropods were solidly established on the land.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''David Thompson''' ([[April 30]], [[1770]] &amp;ndash; [[February 10]], [[1857]]), was an [[English-Canadian]] surveyor and explorer.  He was born in [[London]], and died in [[Montreal]], [[Canada East]].

Thompson was a [[fur]] trader of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].  From 1792 to 1812, he explored and mapped the country west of [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Lake Superior]], across the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the headwaters of the [[Columbia River]] and down the Columbia to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  He was the first [[Europe]]an to explore the Columbia from source to mouth. In 1797, he left the Hudson's Bay Company and joined the [[North West Company]].  The maps he made of the Columbia River basin east of the [[Cascade Mountains]] were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be regarded as authoritative well into the mid-[[20th century]].

The land mass mapped by Thompson amounted to 3.9 million square kilometres of wilderness (1/5th of the continent). His contemporary, the great explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], remarked that Thompson did more in ten months than he would have thought possible in two years.  Thompson's [[1814]] map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis for many of the maps issued by the Canadian government and the railways. Thompson also completed the exacting survey of much of the Canada/U.S. boundary along the [[49th parallel]] in the west, and from the St. Lawrence River to Lake of the Woods in Ontario. 

He married [[Charlotte Small]], a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], the &quot;Woman of the Paddle Song.&quot;  He and Charlotte had 13 children.

In his published journals, Thompson recorded seeing large footprints near [[Jasper, Alberta]], in [[1811]]. It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the [[sasquatch]].  

Alexander Mackenzie strongly resented some of Thompson's actions and wrote a letter to the king in which he is said to have denounced Thompson for marrying a Métis.  

Thompson died in Montreal in near obscurity, his achievements almost unrecognized. He is interred there in the [[Mount Royal Cemetery]]. However, in 1957, one hundred years after his death, the Canadian government honored him with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of Canada|Canadian postage stamp]].  His prowess as a geographer is now well-recognized.  He has been called &quot;the greatest land geographer who ever lived.&quot;

Planning is underway for bicentennial recognition of Thompson's trans-mountain exploits. Visit [http://www.davidthompson200.org DavidThompson200] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the dental profession.  For tooth care, see [[oral hygiene]].
[[Image:Dental x-ray.jpg|right|frame|[[Radiographs]] ([[X-ray]]s) can reveal if a person has cavities]]
'''Dentistry''' is the art and science of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions, diseases, and disorders of the oral cavity, the maxillofacial region, and its associated structures as it relates to human beings. A dentist is a doctor qualified to treat diseases, malformations of, and injuries to teeth, a professional practitioner of dentistry. In most countries,  several years of training in a [[university]] (usually 4-8) and some practical experience working with actual patients' [[dentition]] are required to become a qualified dentist. The patron saint of dentists is [[Saint Apollonia]], martyred in Alexandria by having all her teeth violently extracted, not, one would have thought, such a very desirable exemplar.

==Specialties==
[[Image:Métiers-Dentiste, humour-années 20.JPG|frame|right|Visits to the dentist are often feared or dreaded.]]

There are nine dental specialties recognized by the [[American Dental Association]] and require 2-6 years of further formal university training after dental school.  The specialties are [[Dental Public Health]] (study of dental epidemiology and social health policies), [[Endodontics]] ([[root canal]] therapy), [[Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology]] (study, diagnosis, and often the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases), [[Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology]] (study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases), [[Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery]] ([[extraction (dental)|extractions]] and facial surgery), [[Orthodontics]] (straightening of teeth), [[Pedodontics]] (pediatric dentistry; i.e. dentistry for children), [[Periodontics]] (treatment of gum disease), [[Prosthodontics]] (replacement of missing facial anatomy by prostheses such as dentures, bridges and implants).

Specialists in these fields are designated registrable (U.S. &quot;Board Eligible&quot;) and warrant exclusive titles such as orthodontist, oral surgeon, pedodontist, periodontist, or prosthodontist upon satisfying certain local (U.S. &quot;Board Certified&quot;) registry requirements.

Two other post-graduate formal advanced education programs: [[General Practice Residency]] (advanced clinical and didactic training with intense hospital experience) and [[Advanced Education in General Dentistry]] (advanced training in clinical dentistry) recognized by the [http://www.ada.org ADA] do not lead to specialization.

Other dental education exists where no post-graduate formal university training is required: [[cosmetic dentistry]], [[dental implant]], [[Temporomandibular joint disorder|temporo-mandibular joint therapy]]. These usually require the attendance of one or more continuing education courses that typically last for one to several days. There are restrictions on allowing these dentists to call themselves specialists in these fields.  The specialist titles are registrable titles and controlled by the local dental licensing bodies.

[[Forensic odontology]] consists of the gathering and use of dental evidence in law.  This may be performed by any dentist with experience or training in this field.  The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.

[[Geriatric dentistry]] or gerodontics is the delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.

==History==
[[Image:Johann Liss 002.jpg|thumb|''Farmer at the dentist'', [[Johann Liss]], c. 1616-17.]]

In [[2001]] archaeologists studying the remains of two men from [[Mehrgarh]], [[Pakistan]], made the discovery that the people of [[Indus Valley Civilization]], even from the early [[Harappa]]n periods (c. [[3300 BC]]), had knowledge of medicine and dentistry. The physical anthropologist that carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri-Columbia, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men (see [[History of medicine]]).

Some information contained in the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] dates as early as [[3000 BC]] and includes the treatment of several dental ailments ([http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8.htm] &amp; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9032043]). The [[Ebers papyrus]] also discusses similar treatments ([http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm]). Examining the remains of some [[History of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Greco-Roman]]s reveal early attempts at dental [[prosthetic]]s and [[surgery]] ([http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm]).

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses.  During the middle ages and through the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession into itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. [[Barber|Barbers]] usually limited their practice to extracting teeth, which not only resulted in the alleviation of [[pain]], but often cured a variety of ailments linked with chronic tooth [[infection]].  Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac invented the dental pelican (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used through the late 18th century.  The pelican was replaced by the [[Dental Key|dental key]] which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 20th century.

For more information on the ancient history of dentistry refer to the ''[http://www.idakerala.org/dentistryhome.asp Indian Dental Association's '''History of Dentistry'''].''

==Dentistry throughout the world==
===Dentistry in Australia===
In [[Australia]], graduating dentists earn either a B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) or B.D.Sc (Bachelor of Dental Science) degree.

Regarded as one of the premier dentistry courses in Australia, the B.D.Sc course at the University of Melbourne spans five years, pending an accumulation of both high school performance ([[Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (ENTER) score in Victoria or other national equivalent; International Bachelorette or any other International equivalent) and [[UMAT|Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT)]] scores.  Clinical practice during the course begins during year one at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne, adjacent to the main campus of the University (and also to the Royal Women's Hospital).  The first three years are mainly theoretically based in the wider aspect of health sciences including anatomy, biology, chemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and neuroscience.  Significant clinical experience is gained right up until the fifth and final year, which consists almost completely of clinical work. [http://coursesearch.unimelb.edu.au/coursedetail.aspx?cid=726&amp;ctype=1&amp;typeall=1&amp;typepg=0&amp;typeug=0&amp;typesc=0&amp;stype=Interest&amp;sterm=28 BDSc at MU]

Also spanning five years, the B.D.Sc offered by the University of Queensland (UQ) combines high-school performance with an in-person interview on campus.  UMAT scores do not apply.  It is unique to Australia as it involves a 1-3-1 program: undergraduates undertake one year of preliminary generalist science courses, followed by three years of theoretical and clinical-based theory at the dental school. It is concluded by one year of extra-mural studies in regional placements.

===Dentistry in Canada===
Canadian dentistry is overseen by the [[Canadian Dental Association]], while specialization is overseen by the [[Royal College of Dentists]]. Today, Canada has about 16,000 dentists. Canadian dentistry is not publicly run (see [[Medicare (Canada)]]); only children and the elderly can have free dental care. Other Canadians are mostly covered by workplace dental plans, but many have to pay out of pocket.

For most of the early colonial period dentistry was a rare and unusual practice in Canada. In severe situations, barbers or blacksmiths would pull a tooth, but for many years [[Canada]] lagged behind European advances. The first dentists in [[Canada]] were [[United Empire Loyalists]] who fled the [[American Revolution]].  The first recorded dentist in Canada was a Mr. Hume who advertised in a [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] newspaper in [[1814]].

During the first half of the 19th century, dentistry expanded rapidly. In [[1867]] the [[Ontario Dental Association]] was formed and in [[1868]] they founded Canada's first dental school in [[Toronto]], the [[Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]. The [[University of Toronto]] agreed to be affiliated with the dental school. As time passed, other Canadian universities also created dentistry programmes.

===Dentistry in Chile===
Universidad de Concepcion (University of Concepcion) was the first university in exist this profession in 1919. Other important university is Universidad de Chile (University of Chile)

===Dentistry in Hong Kong===
The longest record for such ongoing and routine training and qualifying requirement for dental specialties in the world exists in [[Hong Kong]] where 5 years of pre-specialty, formal training and supervised practice are prescribed. It is accepted that only after 5 years of such training would the trainees achieve a superior level of professional competence.

===Dentistry in India===
Modern Indian dentists must earn the Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree (B.D.S.), which requires four years of study and one year of internship. This degree is overseen by the Dental Council of India. In most states, one has to appear for an entrance test conducted by the Directorate of Medical Education, whereas some autonomous universities conduct their own entrance tests.Post graduate courses (Master of Dental Surgery. MDS) are also available in different specialities.It requires 3 years of study after BDS.

===Dentistry in Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], there are 3 universities currently offering dentistry course. The universities are [[Universiti Malaya]], [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sains Malaysia]], although many other Malaysian universities are showing interest in offering undergraduate course in dentistry in the future.

Dentists trained in Malaysia have to complete 5 years of undergraduate study (previously 4 years) before earning a B.D.S (Universiti Malaya) or a D.D.S (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia/Universiti Sains Malaysia). Undergraduates in Malaysia are required to spend the first 2 years in pre-clinical lectures and the next 3 years they are required to do clinical sessions as well as attending lectures.

Once graduated from the course, Malaysian dentists are required to serve the Malaysian Government for 3 years compulsory service, regardless where they completed their undergraduate study. They can choose to work under Kementerian Kesihatan (Ministry of Health) or Kementerian Pertahanan (Ministry of Defence) as a military dentist.

====Malaysian dentistry schools====

===Dentistry in Pakistan===
At present there are upwards of 20 dental schools (public &amp; private) throughout Pakistan, according to the [http://www.pmdc.org.pk/ Pakistan Medical &amp; Dental Council] the state regulatory body has upwards of 6200 registered dentists.   The four year training culminates in achieveing a ''Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS)'' degree, which also requires a one year compulsary interneship to be a registered dentist in Pakistan.

===Dentistry in Slovakia===
In [[Slovakia]], dentists complete 6 years of undergraduate study to earn a MUDr (lat. ''Medicinae Universae Doctor'') degree. Junior graduates work under a skilled doctor for at least 3 years to receive their license from [[The Slovak Chamber of Dentists]].

===Dentistry in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], dentists complete 5 years of undergraduate study to earn a B.D.S. degree.  After graduating most dentists will enter a V.T. (vocational training) scheme, of either 1 or 2 years length, to receive their full [[National Health Service]] registration.  Dentists must register with the G.D.C. ([http://www.gdc-uk.org General Dental Council]), and meet their requirements as the governing body of the profession, before being allowed to practice.

===Dentistry in the United States===
In the [[United States]], dentists earn either a D.D.S. ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]) or D.M.D.([[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]) degree.  There are 56 Accredited Dental schools in the United States requiring 4 years of post graduate study (except for one unique 3 year program at the University of the Pacific)[http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/programs/search_ddsdmd_us.asp].  Most applicants to dental school have attained at least a B.S. or B.A. degree, however, a small percentage are admitted after only fulfilling specific prerequisite courses.  So unlike many other countries, it can take more then 8 years to become a dentist.  ([[List of dental schools in the United States]]) The degrees D.D.S. and D.M.D. require equivalent education and are identical in every way.  The difference relates to the history involved in the division of medicine and surgery in medical practice.  There has been a recent movement to include a 5th year of education that focuses on purely practical training in the clinical setting.  In at least one state, a state dental license can be received without taking the licensing exam (State Board Exam) upon completing this additional year of training.
Dentists are licensed and regulated by the state in which they practice.  The license is only valid in the issuing state and is non-transferable.  There are many cooperative agreements between states that allow recognition of another state's license so as to procure a license either via &quot;licensure by credentials&quot; or &quot;licensure by reciprocity.&quot;

A dentist may go on for further training in a dental specialty which require an additional 1 to 7 years of post-doctoral training. There are 9 recognized dental specialties.  They are Endodontics(root canal treatment), Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontics(gums), Prosthodontics(complicated dental reconstruction), Orthodontics(braces), Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery(tooth removal and surgery of the oral and related structures), and Dental Public Health.  There is no specialty in esthetic dentistry or implantology, and no additional training is required for a dentist to make the claim of being an esthetic or cosmetic dentist.

Any general dentist may perform those procedures designated within the enumerated specialties if they deem themselves competent.  Many general dentists train in certain aspects of the above specialties such as the placement and restoration of dental implants, advanced prosthodontics and endodontics, and have limited or heavily focused their practices to these areas.  When a general dentist performs any procedure that falls within the realm of a specialty, they are expected to perform with the same level of expertise as a certified specialist and are legally held to such standards with respect to any issues of malpractice.

===Dentistry in Italy===
In [[Italy]] dentists complete 5 years of undergraduate study to earn a degree. Nevertheless it is possible to agree on certain [[basic clinical competences]] common to all member states of the [[European Union]].

The following is an example of one such clinical competency ([[excision of a buried tooth root]]): If a clinician is deemed to be clinically competent in the surgercal removal of a buried root, this implies much more than the technical and surgical ability required to excise a buried piece of [[root]] from [[alveolus]]. It embraces a broad range of preclinical and [[clinical knowledge]] and understanding on which [[surgical treatment]] is based.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''For the authentication, authorisation, and accounting protocol, see [[DIAMETER]].''

In [[geometry]], a '''diameter''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] words ''diairo'' = divide and ''metro'' = measure) of a [[circle]] is any straight [[line segment]] that passes through the [[center]] and whose [[endpoints]] are on the circular boundary, or, in more modern usage, the [[length]] of such a line segment. When using the word in the more modern sense, one speaks of ''the'' diameter rather than ''a'' diameter, because all diameters of a [[circle]] have the same length. This length is twice the [[radius]].  The diameter of a circle is also the longest chord that the circle has.

The '''diameter''' of a [[connected graph]] is the distance between the two [[vertex|vertices]] which are furthest from each other. The distance between two vertices ''a'' and ''b'' is the length of the shortest path connecting them (for the length of a path, see [[Graph theory]]).

The two definitions given above are special cases of a more general definition. The '''diameter''' of a [[subset]] of a [[metric space]] is the [[supremum|least upper bound]] of the distances between pairs of points in the subset. So, if ''A'' is the subset, the diameter is
:[[supremum|sup]] { d(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A'' } .

In medical [[idiom#parlance|parlance]] the diameter of a [[lesion]] is the longest line segment whose endpoints are within the lesion.

==Diameter symbol==

[[Image:Sign diameter.png|thumb|150px|Sign Ø from [[Autocad]] drawing]]

The [[symbol]] or [[variable]] for diameter is similar in size and design to ø, the lowercase letter o with stroke.  [[Unicode]] provides character number 8960 ([[hexadecimal]] 2300) for the symbol, which can be encoded in [[HTML]] webpages as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#8960;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#x2300;&lt;/tt&gt;.  Proper display of this character, however, is unlikely in most situations, as most [[Typeface|font]]s do not have it included.  ''(Your browser displays &amp;#x2300; and &amp;#8960; in the current font.)'' In most situations the letter ø is acceptable, obtained in [[Microsoft Windows]] by holding the &lt;tt&gt;[Alt]&lt;/tt&gt; key down while entering&lt;tt&gt; 0 2 4 8 &lt;/tt&gt; on the [[numeric keypad]].

It is important not to confuse a diameter symbol (ø) with the [[empty set]] symbol, similar to the uppercase Ø. Diameter is also sometimes called [[phi]] (pronounced the same as &quot;fie&quot;), although this seems to come from the fact that Ø and ø look like &amp;Phi; and &amp;phi;, the letter phi in the [[Greek alphabet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{EvidenceLaw}}
'''Direct examination''' (also called examination in chief) is the questioning of a witness by the party who called him or her, in a [[trial (law)|trial]] in a [[court of law]].  Direct examination is usually performed to elicit [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party's claim or defense.   

In direct examination, one is generally prohibited from asking [[leading question]]s. This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a favorable witness. An exception to this rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood, or soon becomes plain, that the witness is hostile to the questioner's side of the controversy. The lawyer may then ask the court to declare the person he or she has called to the stand a [[hostile witness]]. If the court does so, the lawyer may thereafter ply the witness with leading questions during direct examination.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Drunkenness''', in its most common usage, is the state of being '''intoxicated''' with [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] to a sufficient degree to impair mental and motor functioning. It is part of the [[effects of alcohol on the body]].

A person who is habitually intoxicated in this manner is labeled an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], often referred to as a &quot;drunk&quot; (a shortened form of the more traditional term &quot;drunkard&quot;) or colloquially as a &quot;lush&quot;, &quot;alco&quot;, &quot;alkie&quot;, or &quot;[[jakey]]&quot;.

'''Drunkenness''' can also be used to describe the effects of any number of [[illegal drugs]]. (More commonly referred to as being &quot;high&quot; or &quot;stoned&quot;)

== Cultural attitudes ==

Many societies have cultural stereotypes associated with drunkenness; some consider the ability to drink vast quantities of alcohol worthy of respect. Arguably, such an attitude can be regarded as [[pathological]], as it may lead to [[alcoholism]]. In many public places for alcoholic consumption such as [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, the act of not drinking alcohol and refusing offers of alcoholic drinks may appear to be &quot;spoiling the atmosphere&quot; and be met with social disapproval. However, an intoxicated person is often considered unable to control his/her urges or acknowledging limits of drinking and is thus treated with disrespect, related to annoying, or intrusive behavior. 

The symptoms of drunkenness are generally reported to be positive, at least initially. As the effects diminish, the associated [[hangover]] starts, mostly a result of dehydration and exhaustion.

The [[ancient Greeks]] believed that putting a piece of [[amethyst]] in the glass or in one's mouth while drinking prevented drunkenness, and indeed the name of the gem alludes to this belief ([[Ancient Greek]]: &quot;a-methyst&quot; meaning &quot;not intoxicated&quot;). 

Many religions discourage or prohibit alcohol consumption.  The [[Qur'an]], or book of [[Islam]], declares that [[God]] prohibits the consumption of alcohol by humankind, because of harmful effects for the body, harmful effects for the consumer's life and family, social problems, and distraction from mindfulness of God.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] states in paragraph 2290 of the Catacysm of the Catholic Church (CCC 2290):
&quot;The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air.&quot; The Church does not prohibit the use of alcohol if it is done in moderation.

[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] abstain from alcohol to avoid unintentionally harming others.  The intoxication of the mind also is at odds with the teaching of mindfulness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer science]] and [[information theory]], '''data compression''' or '''source coding''' is the process of encoding information using fewer [[bit]]s (or other information-bearing units) than an [[code|unencoded]] representation would use through use of specific encoding schemes.  For example, this article could be encoded with fewer bits if we accept the convention that the word &quot;compression&quot; be encoded as &quot;comp&quot;.  
One popular instance of compression that many computer users are familiar with is the [[ZIP file format]], which, as well as providing compression, acts as an [[file archiver|archiver]], storing many files in a single output file.

As is the case with any form of communication, compressed data communication only works when both the [[sender]] and receiver of the [[information]] understand the encoding scheme. For example, this text makes sense only if the receiver understands that it is intended to be interpreted as characters representing the English language.  Similarly, compressed data can only be understood if the decoding method is known by the receiver.

Compression is possible because most real-world data have ''statistical redundancy''.  For example, the letter 'e' is much more common in English text than the letter 'z', and the probability that the letter 'q' will be followed by the letter 'z' is rather small. ''Lossless'' compression algorithms exploit statistical redundancy in such a way as to represent the sender's data more concisely, but nevertheless perfectly.

Further compression is possible if some loss of fidelity is allowable.  For example, a person viewing a picture or television video scene might not notice if some of its finest details are removed or not represented perfectly.  Similarly, two strings of samples representing an audio recording may sound the same but actually not be exactly the same. ''Lossy'' compression algorithms introduce relatively minor differences and represent the picture, video, or audio using fewer bits.

Compression is important because it helps reduce the consumption of expensive resources, such as disk space or connection bandwidth.  However, compression requires information processing power, which can also be expensive.  The design of data compression schemes therefore involves trade-offs between various factors including compression capability, any amount of introduced distortion, computational resource requirements, and often other considerations as well.

Some schemes are reversible so that the original data can be reconstructed ([[lossless data compression]]), while others accept some loss of data in order to achieve higher compression ([[lossy data compression]]). 

Perhaps surprisingly, lossless data compression algorithms will always make some files ''bigger'', that is, an algorithm that universally reduces the size of every possible file is impossible. This also explains why compressing a compressed file again will usually only increase the size of the “compressed” file, otherwise any amount of data could eventually be made to fit on a floppy disk. In practice lossy data compression will come to a point where compressing again does not work either, although an extremely lossy algorithm, which for example always removes the last byte of a file, will always compress a file up to the point where it is empty. Decompressing is of course impossible when one uses such an algorithm.

== Applications ==
One very simple means of compression, for example, is [[run-length encoding]], wherein large runs of consecutive identical data values are replaced by a simple code with the data value and length of the run. This is an example of [[lossless data compression]].  It is often used to better use disk space on office computers, or better use the connection bandwidth in a [[computer network]].  For symbolic data such as spreadsheets, text, executable programs, etc., losslessness is essential because changing even a single bit cannot be tolerated (except in some limited cases).

For visual and audio data, some loss of quality can be tolerated without losing the essential nature of the data. By taking advantage of limitations of the human sensory system, a great deal of space can be saved while producing output which is nearly indistinguishable from the original. These [[lossy data compression]] methods typically offer a three-way tradeoff between compression speed, compressed data size and quality loss.

Lossy [[image compression]] is used in [[digital camera]]s, greatly increasing their storage capacities while hardly degrading picture quality at all. Similarly, [[DVD]]s use the lossy [[MPEG-2]] codec for [[video compression]].

In lossy [[audio compression]], methods of [[psychoacoustics]] are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the signal. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques, so that &quot;speech compression&quot; or &quot;voice coding&quot; is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline than &quot;audio compression&quot;.  Different audio and speech compression standards are listed under [[audio codecs]].  Voice compression is used in [[Internet telephony]] for example, while audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by [[MP3]] players.

== Theory ==
The theoretical background of compression is provided by [[information theory]] (which is closely related to [[algorithmic information theory]]) and by [[rate-distortion theory]].  These fields of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Doyle and Carlson ([[2000]]) wrote that data compression &quot;has one of the simplest and most elegant design theories in all of engineering&quot;. [[Cryptography]] and [[coding theory]] are also closely related.  The idea of data compression is deeply connected with statistical inference.

Many lossless data compression systems can be viewed in terms of a [[four-stage model of data compression|four-stage model]].  Lossy data compression systems typically include even more stages, including, for example, prediction, frequency transformation, and quantization.

The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.  [[DEFLATE (algorithm)|DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ which is optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, although compression can be slow.  DEFLATE is used in [[PKZIP]], [[gzip]] and [[PNG]].  [[LZW|LZW]] (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) was patented by [[Unisys Corporation|Unisys]] until June of [[2003]], and is used in GIF images. Also noteworthy are the LZR (LZ-Renau) methods, which serve as the basis of the Zip method.  LZ methods utilize a table based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data.  For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input.  The table itself is often Huffman encoded (e.g. SHRI, LZX).
A current LZ based coding scheme that performs well is [[LZX (algorithm)|LZX]], used in Microsoft's [[cabinet (file format)|CAB]] format.

The very best compressors use probabilistic models whose predictions are coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding, invented by Jorma Rissanen, and turned into a practical method by Witten, Neal, and Cleary, achieves superior compression to the better-known Huffman algorithm, and lends itself especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the predictions are strongly context-dependent. Arithmetic coding is used in the bilevel image-compression standard [[JBIG]], and the document-compression standard, [[DejaVu]]. The text ''entry'' system, [[Dasher]], is an inverse-arithmetic-coder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cleanup-date|October 2005}}'''Durango Boot''' (also called Boot) is a competitive, non-contact [[sport]] that makes use of a flying disc (or [[Frisbee]]), and is similar to [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]].

The flow of Boot is much like Ultimate, but even more fluid with no stoppage of play, even after scores. There's full-on running, lots of give-and-go action, smooth zone defenses, and the whole globe is your playing field. It's very competitive and we have yet to master the game after years of play.

==History==

'''Durango Boot''' is so named because the first time it was played, none of the players had cones to mark the field, so boots were used instead.  The game was originally called '''Boot''', but '''Durango''' was added to the name because it was first played in Durango, CO.

==Rules==

===Field of Play===

Refer to the accompanying diagram for the basic configuration and dimensions. As in Ultimate, the field can easily be altered to fit the space available. Eight cones are used to define the field. Four cones (star dots) are the goals. If your team hits one with the disc, you score. The other four cones (black dots) are used to mark the 'take-back&quot; zone, which is actually a belt that extends all the way around the world. There is no out of bounds.

[[Image:bootfield.jpg]]


===Object of the game===

The object is simply to hit any of the 4 score cones (star dots) with the disc. The cones may be hit by a thrown disc, or if you are in possession of the disc right next to a cone, you may hit the cone without releasing the disc (the 'Slam Dunk').

If the cone is hit by Slam Dunk or a throw from within the zone in front of the &quot;take-back&quot; zone, it counts as 1 point. If the cone is hit by a throw from within the &quot;take-back&quot; cones, it counts as 2 points. If the cone is hit by a throw from beyond of the &quot;take-back&quot; cones, it counts as 3 points. See diagram for examples of throws. 

Games are generally played to 3 points. Win by one point. Best 2 out of 3 games.

===The Play===

Each team fields 3 players. A disc is flipped at midfield, heads or tails is called, and the winner of the flip immediately picks up the disc and takes the offensive. They then work the disc trying to get into position to hit one of the score cones. As in Ultimate, if they fail to complete a pass or if the stall count is reached, it's a turnover. The stall count only goes up to 6 and may be counted by any defensive player no matter where on the field he is. No one needs to mark the thrower.

On a turnover, the defensive team immediately becomes the offensive team, but before they can score, the disc must pass through at least part of the &quot;take-back&quot; zone. This is done by throwing the disc to someone in the &quot;take-back&quot; zone or on the other side of it. If the disc is lying in the &quot;take-back&quot; zone after a turnover, there's no need to take it back.

After a score, the defensive team immediately becomes the offensive team, just like after a turnover. The only difference is that before they can begin play any cones that were knocked over must be reset. There are no &quot;pulls&quot;.

Most of the normal rules of Ultimate apply, e.g. fouls, traveling, etc. However, we generally avoid making calls unless it's very blatant.

==Strategy==

Both offense and defense require an amazing amount of strategy. It's a very heady game. Below is the very basic strategy, but there's lots more to learn as you play.

The basic offensive strategy is to create 2-on-1's and then take advantage of them with very quick give-and-go's. Because there is only one defender trying to defend two cones, one cone will be open. However, if the 2-on-1 becomes a 2-on-2 because the middle defender hustles back, that end of the field should be abandoned and you should try to create a 2-on-1 to the other end of the field. It's almost impossible to score on 2 defenders because they can each defend one cone. Under no circumstances should you bring in the third offensive player to help because when you turn the disc over (either by a turnover or a score), you'll have no one back to defend the cones at the other end of the field.

A zone defense is the most effective defense. One player acts as goalie at each end and one person plays the &quot;take-back zone. The main objective is to stop the 2-on-1 and that's primarily the responsibility of the middle defender. Once two offensive players start moving the disc towards one end, the middle defender needs to move with them to help out his goalie, but he has to be careful not to over-commit or the offense will reverse direction and have a 2-on-1 in the other direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
Its location in the center of Africa has made the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] a key player in the region since independence. Because of its size, [[mineral]] wealth, and strategic location, [[Zaire]] was able to capitalize on [[Cold War]] tensions to garner support from the West. In the early [[1990s]], however, in the face of growing evidence of [[human rights]] abuses, Western support waned as pressure for internal reform increased.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is in the grip of a civil war that has drawn in military forces from neighboring states, with [[Uganda]]n, [[Burundi]]an, and [[Rwanda]]n forces helping the rebel movement which occupies much of the eastern portion of the state. 

One problem is the continuing theft of mineral resources, such as [[coltan]], by occupying forces. One estimate has the Rwandan army making $250 million in 18 months from the sale of coltan, even though Rwanda has no coltan deposits. Not only can the DROC not make any money from its mineral wealth, due to its inability to tax anything in rebel-held areas, but the wealth is also used itself to finance insurgent activities.

Troops from [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Chad]], and [[Sudan]] intervened to support the Kinshasa regime. 

Furthermore, relations with surrounding countries have often been driven by security concerns. Intricate and interlocking alliances have often characterized regional relations. Conflicts in [[Sudan]], [[Uganda]], [[Angola]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] have at various times created bilateral and regional tensions. The current crisis in DROC has its roots both in the use of The Congo as a base by various insurgency groups attacking neighboring countries and in the absence of a broad-based political system in the Congo.

==Disputes - international==

Democratic Republic of the Congo is in the grip of a [[Second Congo War|civil war]] that has drawn in military forces from neighboring states, with [[Uganda]] and [[Rwanda]] supporting the rebel movements that occupy much of the eastern portion of the state - [[Tutsi]], [[Hutu]], [[Lendu]], [[Hema (ethnicity)|Hema]] and other conflicting ethnic groups, political rebels, and various government forces continue fighting in [[Great Lakes region (Africa)|Great Lakes region]], transcending the boundaries of [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Uganda]] - heads of the Great Lakes states pledge to end conflict, but localized violence continues despite [[UN]] peacekeeping efforts; most of the [[Congo River]] boundary with the [[Republic of the Congo]] is indefinite (no agreement has been reached on the division of the river or its islands, except in the [[Pool Malebo]]/[[Stanley Pool]] area).

On December 19, 2005, the [[International Court of Justice]] found against [[Uganda]], in a case brought by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], for illegal invasion of its territory, and violation of human rights.

==Illicit drugs==

The DRC has some illicit production of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], mostly for domestic consumption.  While rampant [[political corruption|corruption]] and inadequate supervision leaves the banking system vulnerable to [[money laundering]], the lack of a well-developed financial system limits the country's utility as a money-laundering center.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of the DRC}}
The area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 10,000 years ago and settled in the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. by [[Bantu]]s from present-day [[Nigeria]]. During its history the area has also been known as ''[[Congo Free State]]'', ''Belgian Congo'' and ''Zaire''.

The most important events in the history of the area (from the point of view of its current situation) occurred in the fifty years or so from about 1870, when European exploration and exploitation took place. Some believe that the rape of the Congo stands alone as the single most brutal and greedy episode of colonisation in modern history. It is described in the entry on the [[Congo Free State]]. 

==The Belgian Congo==

''See also [[Belgian Congo]]''

On [[November 15]], [[1908]], [[Léopold II of Belgium|King Léopold II of Belgium]] formally relinquished personal control of the ''Congo Free State'' and the renamed '''Belgian Congo''' came under the administration of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] parliament, a system which lasted until independence was granted in [[1960]].

The Belgian administration might be most charitably characterized as [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] [[colonialism]].  The educational system was dominated by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Protestant]] churches and the curricula reflected [[Christianity|Christian]] and Western values.  For example, in [[1948]] fully 99.6% of educational facilities were controlled by Christian missions. There was little regard for native culture and beliefs.  Native schooling was mainly religious and vocational.

Political administration fell under the total and direct control of the mother country; there were no democratic institutions. Native curfews and other restrictions were not unusual. Following [[World War II]] some democratic reforms began to be introduced, but these were complicated by ethnic rivalries among the native population.

==Changes in Congolese Society (brief overview)==

At the time the multinational concessionary companies under Léopold's auspices and the Congolese had two very different concepts of land and labor. Understanding the contrasting patterns of production between the traditional Congolese tribal states and modern, industrial Belgium is essential. 

[[Capitalism]] revolutionized the region's traditional economies, inducing social changes and political consequences that revolutionized Congolese society to this day. Balanced, subsistence-based economies shifted to specialization and accumulation of surpluses. These changes revolutionized production patterns because maximizing production and minimizing cost (the specialization of capitalist production) did not necessarily coincide with traditional, seasonal patterns of agricultural production. Rather than specializing in a particular product according to the concept of comparative advantage, and then mass-producing surplus values of this product (rubber) for profit, traditional Congolese tribal states in the past favored balanced, self-reliant, subsistence economies, and hence followed labor patterns that reflected seasonal cycles. 

Tribal states or empires organized along precarious, unwritten cultural traditions also shifted to a division of labor based on legal protection of land and labor&amp;mdash;once inalienable, but now commodities to be bought, sold, or traded. 

The bourgeois ethic of wage/labor productivity was thus, in many respects, a new concept to supposedly &amp;lsquo;idle&amp;rsquo; natives merely accustomed to older patterns of production. On that note, it must be noted that the integration of traditional economies in Congo within the framework of the modern, capitalist economy was also particularly exploitative. The fortunes of King Léopold II and those of the multinational concessionary companies under his auspices were mainly made on the proceeds of Congolese rubber, which had historically never been mass-produced in surplus quantities. Between 1880 and 1920 the population of Congo thus halved; over 10 million &amp;lsquo;indolent natives&amp;rsquo; unaccustomed to the bourgeois ethos of labor productivity, were the victims of murder, starvation, exhaustion induced by over-work, and disease.

Mass-production of rubber in a dense, tropical forest in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most isolated regions was after all quite a massive endeavor. Other parts of Africa were not cultivating rubber (quite a harsh crop to cultivate); other parts of Africa had milder climates and topographies.

==The Democratic Republic of the Congo==

Agitation for independence in the Congo arose fairly late, only becoming a prominent factor by the mid-1950s.  Even this separatist spirit was far more an anti-Belgian movement than one of Congolese nationalism.  

===The First Republic (1960&amp;ndash;1965)===

{{main|Congo Crisis}}

Following a series of riots and unrest, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country. The Belgians announced on [[January 27]], [[1960]] that they would relinquish control in six months. The Congo was granted its independence on [[June 30]], [[1960]]. The country was in a very unstable state&amp;mdash;regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government&amp;mdash;and with the departure of the Belgian administrators almost no skilled bureaucrats were left in the country.  The first Congolese university graduate was only in 1956, and virtually no-one in the new nation had any idea of how to manage a country of such size.  

Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the Marxist [[Patrice Lumumba]] as prime minister and pro-[[Western world|Western]] [[Joseph Kasavubu]] as president of the renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

Even from this fleeting moment of independence democracy began to unravel.  A military coup broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On July 11th the richest province of the country, [[Katanga]], seceded under [[Moise Tshombe]]. To protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order 20,000 [[UN]] peacekeepers were sent to the country. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this same period Congo's second richest province, [[Kasai province]], also announced its independence.

Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] for assistance. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The [[United States]] viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a [[proxy]] state in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. In December 1960, with U.S. and CIA support, Kasavubu and his loyal Colonel [[Joseph Mobutu]] overthrew the government.  Lumumba was assassinated by Mobutu with support of the American government soon after; some have alleged that U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave the CIA direct orders to assassinate Lumumba, but this has never been confirmed. According to other sources, the Belgian government was also in support of such an action. In [[Stanleyville]], those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under [[Antoine Gizenga]].

===The Second &amp; Third Republics (1965&amp;ndash;1996)===

{{main|Zaire}}

Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Mobutu, by then commander in chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years. Mobutu quickly consolidated his power and was elected unopposed as president in 1970. Embarking on a campaign of cultural awareness, Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire and required citizens to adopt African names. Relative peace and stability prevailed until 1977 and 1978 when Katangan rebels, based in [[Angola]], launched a series of [[Shaba Invasions|invasions]] into the Shaba (Katanga) region. The rebels were driven out with the aid of Belgian paratroopers.

During the 1980s, Zaire remained a one-party state. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the [[Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social]] (UDPS), were active. Mobutu's attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism.

As the Cold War came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime's human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his massive embezzlement of government funds for personal use. 

In [[April 1990]], Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of a reform package were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting [[Kinshasa]] to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on [[U.S. Air Force]] planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa.

In 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised [[Sovereign National Conference]] was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop [[Laurent Monsengwo]] as its chairman, along with [[Étienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba]], leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the [[High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition]] (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and [[Kengo Wa Dondo]] as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next 2 years, they never took place.

===War (1996&amp;ndash;)===

{{main articles|[[First Congo War]] and [[Second Congo War]]}}

By 1996, tensions from the neighboring [[Rwanda]] war and [[genocide]] had spilled over to [[Zaire]]: see [[History of Rwanda]]. Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate its massacres in November 1996, the Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu. 

The Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by [[Laurent-Desire Kabila]], became known as the [[Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre]] (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country, and Kabila marched unopposed to Kinshasa on May 20. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Kabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country. He lost his allies and the [[Mouvement pour la Libération du Congo]] (MLC, led by the warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]), backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops attacked in August 1998, soon after Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia sent some form of force into the DRC, with Zimbabwe and Angola supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. Kabila was assassinated in January 2001 by one of his bodyguards, and was succeeded by his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]]. Upon taking office Joseph Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. He partly succeeded in February 2001 when a further peace deal was brokered between Kabila, Rwanda and Uganda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops. [[UN]] peacekeepers, MONUC, arrived in April 2001.

Currently the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a 200 mile wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie]] (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country (including [[diamond]]s, [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[coltan]]). The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. 

Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders (held in [[Sun City, South Africa|Sun City]]) lasted a full six weeks (beginning in April 2002). In June they signed a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. 

Ethnic clashes in the northeast were still continuing in 2004, especially violence between the Hema and Lendu tribes in the Kivu region of eastern Congo.

Presently, DR Congo is in an transitional period, where a constution has been approved by voters and presidential elections expected to be held in June 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] includes the greater part of the Congo River Basin, which covers an area of almost 1 million square kilometers (400,000 sq. mi.). The country's only outlet to the Atlantic Ocean is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Congo River.

[[Image:ISS007-E-6305.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Image of Kinshasa and Brazzaville, taken by NASA]]

The vast, low-lying central area is a basin-shaped plateau sloping toward the west and covered by tropical rainforest. This area is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north. High mountains are found in the extreme eastern region.

The DRC lies on the Equator, with one-third of the country to the north and two-thirds to the south. The climate is hot and humid in the river basin and cool and dry in the southern highlands. South of the Equator, the rainy season lasts from October to May and north of the Equator, from April to November. Along the Equator, rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year. During the wet season, thunderstorms often are violent but seldom last more than a few hours. The average rainfall for the entire country is about 1.07 metres (42 in).

The population of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was estimated at 46.7 million in [[1997]]. As many as 250 [[ethnic group]]s have been distinguished and named. The most numerous people are the [[Bakongo]], [[Luba]], and [[Mongo]]. Although 700 local [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by the use of [[French language|French]] and the intermediary languages [[Kikongo]], [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]], [[Swahili]], and [[Lingala language|Lingala]].

About 80% of the Congolese population are [[Christian]], predominantly [[Roman Catholic]]. Most of the non-Christians adhere to either traditional [[religion]]s or syncretic [[sect]]s. Traditional religions embody such concepts as [[monotheism]], [[animism]], [[vitalism]], [[spirit]] and [[ancestor worship]], [[witchcraft]], and [[sorcery]] and vary widely among ethnic groups; none is formalized. The syncretic sects often merge Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals. The most popular of these sects, [[Kimbanguism]], was seen as a threat to the [[Belgian Congo|colonial regime]] and was banned by the [[Belgium|Belgians]]. Kimbanguism, officially &quot;the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet [[Simon Kimbangu]],&quot; now has about 3 million members, primarily among the [[Bakongo]] of Bas-Congo and [[Kinshasa]]. In [[1969]], it was the first independent [[Africa]]n church admitted to the [[World Council of Churches]].

Before [[History_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo#The_First_Republic_.281960-1965.29|independence]], [[education]] was largely in the hands of religious groups. The [[primary school]] system was well-developed at independence; however, the [[secondary school]] system was limited, and [[post-secondary education|higher education]] was almost nonexistent in most regions of the country. The principal objective of this system was to train low-level administrators and [[clerk]]s. Since independence, efforts have been made to increase access to education, and secondary and higher education have been made available to many more Congolese. Despite the deterioration of the state-run educational system in recent years, about 80% of the males and 65% of females, ages 6-11, were enrolled in a mixture of state- and church-run primary schools in 1996. At higher levels of education, males greatly outnumber females. The elite continues to send their children abroad to be educated, primarily in [[Western Europe]].

Sparsely populated in relation to its area, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is home to a vast potential of natural resources and [[mineral]] wealth, yet the [[Economics|economy]] of the DROC has declined drastically since the mid-[[1980s]]. [[Agriculture]] is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in [[1997]]. Main cash crops include [[coffee]], [[palm oil]], [[rubber]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[tea]], and [[cocoa]]. Food crops include [[cassava]], [[plantains]], [[maize]], [[groundnuts]], and [[rice]]. In [[1996]], agriculture employed 66% of the work force.

Industry, especially [[mining]], remains a great potential source of wealth for DROC. In 1997, industry accounted for 16.9% of GDP. The Congo was the world's fourth-largest producer of industrial [[diamond]]s during the 1980s, and diamonds continue to dominate exports, accounting for $717 million or 52% of exports in 1997. The Congo's main [[copper]] and [[cobalt]] interests are dominated by [[Gecamines]], the state-owned mining giant. Gecamines production has faltered in recent years, due in part to a competitive world copper market.

Despite the country's vast potential, under the [[Mobutu]] regime widespread corruption, economic controls, and the diversion of public resources for personal gain thwarted economic growth. The unrecorded and illicit transactions of Zaire's unofficial economy were estimated in the early [[1990s]] to be three times the size of official GDP.

The Congo's record with multilateral and bilateral donors has been uneven. Despite a succession of economic plans financed by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) since independence, budgetary imbalance, [[inflation]], and debt consistently plagued the Mobutu government. In early [[1990]], both the World Bank and the IMF suspended most disbursements, and most bilateral aid was cut off. Unable to make debt payments, Zaire's borrowing rights with the IMF were cut off in February [[1992]]; its World Bank credits were frozen in July [[1993]]. Despite the introduction of a new currency, the [[New Zaire]] (NZ), currency issuance remained disorderly, and largescale inflation rose to over 9,000% by early 1994.

In [[May 1997]] the [[AFDL]], led by [[Laurent Kabila]], overthrew the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko. Under President Kabila the government and state enterprises began a program of reconstruction. The government began to reform the corrupt [[tax]] system, civilian [[police]] force, and repair the damaged road system.

In [[August 1998]], a war broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At that time, some progress had been made in the economic reconstruction of the country, but major problems continued to exist in transportation infrastructure, customs administration, and the tax system. Government finances had not been put in order and relations with the IMF and World Bank were in disarray. Much of the government's revenue was kept &quot;off book,&quot; and not included in published statistics on revenue and expenditure. Relations with the World Bank were on hold as a result of the government's failure to finalize an agreement for administration of the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) Trust Fund for the Congo.

The outbreak of war in the early days of August 1998 caused a major decline in economic activity that continues to the present. The country has been divided into rebel- and government-held territories, and commerce between them has stopped. The economic and commercial links among the various sections of the country are not strong, but they are important.

After a surge in inflation during August 1998, the government began enforcing [[price control]] laws. It also began regulating foreign exchange markets. Taken together, these measures have severely damaged the ability of businesses depending on imports to continue operations. Furthermore, the small gains against inflation and [[currency depreciation]] were quickly reversed when the foreign-backed rebellion in the eastern part of the country began in August 1998. The war has dramatically reduced government revenue, and increased external debt. Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict and because of increased government harassment and restrictions.  The wide spread between the official rate for buying the new currency, [[Congo francs]] (FCs), and the black market rate for buying [[dollar]]s has forced merchants to price their imported goods according to the official rate for buying local currency.

Poor [[infrastructure]], an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake on investment and growth. A number of [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic plan but associated reforms are on hold.  Faced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more drastic measures and in [[January 1999]] banned the widespread use of U.S. dollars for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later adjusted. The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for economic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its expenditure.  Growth was negative in [[2000]] because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability. 

Conditions improved in late [[2002]] with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data.

With relative peace in the country during [[2003]], the DRC aims to increase its exports of [[electricity]] to [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] to 500 [[megawatt]]s from 210 megawatts (mostly from the [[Inga dam]]). Electricity distribution in the DRC is licensed to a [[Zambia|Zambian]] company, [[CEC]].

Despite President [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]'s claims that his was a [[transitional government]] leading to a new [[constitution]] and full elections by April [[1999]], these elections have not [[as of 2004]] been held, and a [[1998]] draft constitution has not been finalized. All executive, legislative, and military powers are vested in the president. The judiciary is independent, with the president having the power to dismiss or appoint. The president is head of a 26-member cabinet dominated by the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (ADFL).

After some successes at improving internal security and lowering the [[inflation rate]] over his first year, Kabila was unable to control insurgent activities by various armed groups. Activities by [[Hutu]] ex-FAR/[[Interahamwe]], [[Mai-Mai]] soldiers, and a February [[1998]] mutiny by [[Tutsi]] [[Banyamulenge]] destabilized the regime. In addition, Kabila's pledges to democratize the government over time contrasted with the reality of banned political parties and increasingly centralized power. Criticism of Kabila's government grew both domestically and within the international community.

In an attempt to stabilize the country and consolidate his control after his [[1997]] victory in the [[First Congo War]], President Kabila in August [[1998]] expelled the [[Rwanda]]n troops remaining in DRC . This prompted army mutinies in Kinshasa and the Kivu provinces in the east. Although the Kinshasa mutiny was put down, the mutiny in the Kivus continued and mushroomed into a drive to topple the government, now called the [[Second Congo War]]. Opposing the Kabila government were factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), [[Rwanda]], and [[Uganda]]. The Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), another rebel group, emerged later. Defending the Kabila government were the former Rwandan army (ex-FAR)/Interahamwe militia, [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Chad]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the Congolese army (FAC).

A cease-fire was signed on [[10 July]] [[1999]] by the DROC, [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Uganda]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], and Congolese armed rebel groups, but sporadic fighting continued. Kabila was assassinated on [[16 January]] [[2001]] and his son [[Joseph Kabila]] was named head of state ten days later. In October [[2002]], the new president was successful in getting occupying Rwandan forces to withdraw from eastern Congo; two months later, an agreement was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and set up a government of national unity, though final peace remains elusive.

The '''military of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]''' is currently in the rebuilding process after the [[Second Congo War]] officially ended in July 2003. [[Rwandan]]- and [[Ugandan]]-created [[militia]]s have hampered the formation of the new national army by their refusal to disband. The military is one of the most unstable in the region after years of war and underfunding. It is prone to defections. The government in [[Kinshasa]] and the [[U.N.]] are attempting to create a viable force with the ability to perform all tasks it is entrusted with, the most important being bringing stability and security to the nation.  

There are currently over 16,000 United Nations peacekeepers based in Congo to assist Congolese authorities in maintaining security. In recent events the military has made it clear to [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] they will defend their borders from any future incursions by either nation, which could further strain attempts to rebuild the nation's already battered security structure. 
==Organization==
The current organization of the Congo's military establishment is very vague owing to lack of information; it has been made more difficult because of the current reforms being undertaken by the Congo security forces.  
It is known to be broken up into the Army, Navy and Air Force; however, no official names seem to be available owing to the reform process.
==Resources==
A key issue for the Congo's military is the lack of resources. The lack of money restricts the capabilities by not allowing the proper training, payment and weapons to be given to the military. It has been an ongoing issue ever since the [[U.S.]] and most of its allies cut support for the government of [[Mobutu]] at the end of [[Cold War]] and the increasing amount of human rights abuses carried out by his security forces. Although the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] maintains vast natural resources its economy has been torn apart by conflict and corruption. The infrastructure has been widely destroyed, thereby restricting the mobility and logistical ability of any new Congolese national military establishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most [[Denmark|Danes]] today trace their heritage to a Germanic people who have inhabited Denmark since prehistoric times.  However, with immigration in recent into the country from various parts of the world, the Danish population has become increasingly heterogeneous. [[Danish language|Danish]] is the principal language of [[Denmark]].

During the [[Völkerwanderung]] migrations (times of [[Huns]] and later [[Slavs]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] onslaughts into [[Magna Germania]]), Danes came onto the peninsula of [[Jutland]]. They were repelled by native Juetlanders, Friesians and other native Germanic tribes. Danish attackers left many ships, on which they came, stuck in the moors, which can still be found today. In time the [[Franks|Frankish]]/German emperors married off the Jutland chief's daughters to Danes, thus making them part of the empire as kings.

A small German-speaking minority lives in southern part of Denmark on Jutland, more exactly in northern Sleswig. [[Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] dukes were for a long time under the Holy Roman Empire also the kings of Denmark. The dukes of Schleswig/Holstein were to also be kings of Denmark, but it was to always remain separate. Despite this the northern part of Schleswig near Tondern was cut off and &quot;given&quot; to Denmark after the first world war at [[Versailles]]. Today most people in border regions of Europe speak both languages.

A mostly [[Inuit]] population inhabits [[Greenland]]; and the [[Faroe Islands]] have a Nordic population with its own language. Education is compulsory from ages seven to 18 and is free through the university level.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church (''Den danske folkekirke'') is state-supported and, according to statistics from January 2002, accounts for about 84.3% of Denmark's religious affiliation. Denmark has religious freedom, however, and other religions exist, both Protestant denominations and other.  The office of the Minister of Religion (''Kirkeministeren'') recognizes 12 different religions for tax and legal purposes; in addition it acknowledges a number of other religious groups for the purpose of conducting wedding ceremonies.

[[Ansgar]] was in [[835]] designated archbishop over the North and East. His bishopric [[Hamburg-Bremen]] remained so until Lund was designed to take on their own archbishopric in [[1103]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Denmark]]'s industrialized market economy depends on imported raw materials and foreign trade. Within the [[European Union]], Denmark advocates a liberal trade policy. Its standard of living is among the highest in the world, and the Danes devote 0,7% of GDP to foreign aid.

Denmark is self-sufficient in energy - producing oil, natural gas and wind-energy. Its principal exports are machinery, instruments and food products. The U.S. is Denmark's largest non-European trading partner, accounting for about 5% of total Danish merchandise trade. Aircraft, computers, machinery, and instruments are among the major U.S. exports to Denmark. There are some 250 U.S.-owned companies in Denmark. Among major Danish exports to the U.S. are industrial machinery, chemical products, furniture, pharmaceuticals, and canned ham and pork.

From 1982, a center-right government corrected accumulated economic pressures, mainly [[inflation]] and balance-of-payments deficits, but lost power in 1993 to a [[Social democracy|Social Democratic]] coalition government led by [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], who remained in office following the March [[1998]] election. The government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen had success in cutting official unemployment, which peaked at 12.5% and is now below 5.5 %. Average annual growth rates are now 2-3%. In [[November]] [[2001]], a center-right government led by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] won the election on maintaining the current [[tax]] level, and improving the overall administrational efficiency. 

For the last two years (2004,2005) the danish economy has been surprisingly strong - surplus on the national budget is expected to be 39 billions DKK for 2006.
The government of Denmark is using most of this surplus to reduce the national debt (total net national debt (internal+external) was 417.8 billions DKK at the end of 2005 ).

Danes are proud of their highly developed welfare safety net, which ensures that all Danes receive free health care and need not fear real poverty. Over the last 20 years, however, the number of Danes living on transfer payments has grown to about 1 million working-age persons (roughly 20% of the population), and the system is beginning to show strains. Health care and care for the elderly particularly have suffered, and the need for welfare reform is increasingly discussed. More than one-quarter of the labor force is employed in the public sector. Thus 61% of the adult population in Denmark is either living of transfer payments or employed by the government (2005). The large public sector is financed through high taxes. A [[Value added tax]] of 25% is levied on the sale of most goods and services (including groceries). The income tax in Denmark ranges from 9%-44% for ultra-low to low-income families to 44%-62% progressively for middle class families. 850,000 Danes (31% of everyone employed and 44% of all full-time employees) pay a marginal income tax of 62%. The number of Danes paying a marginal income tax of 62% in 2006 is expected to be 925,000.

==Greenland and the Faroe Islands==
:''Main articles: [[Economy of the Faroe Islands]]  and [[Economy of Greenland]]
Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. A tight fiscal policy by the Greenland Home Rule Government since the late 1980s helped create a low inflation rate and surpluses in the public budget, but at the cost of rising foreign debts of the Home Rule Government's commercial entities. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit.

Following the closure of Greenland's last lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland's economy is solely dependent on the fishing industry and Danish grants. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and [[mineral]] exploration activities, it will take several years before production may materialize. Greenland's shrimp fishery is by far the largest income earner, since cod catches have dropped to historically low levels. Tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is limited due to the short season and high costs. The public sector plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. Grants from mainland Denmark and EU fisheries payments make up about one-half of the home-rule government's revenues.

The Faroe Islands also depend almost entirely on fisheries and related exports. Without Danish Government bailouts in 1992 and 1993, the Faroese economy would have gone bankrupt. Since 1995, the Faroese economy has seen a noticeable upturn, but remains extremely vulnerable. Recent off-shore oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for Faroese deposits, too, which may lay the basis for an economic rebound over the longer term.

==Economy - overview==
This thoroughly modern market economy features high-tech [[agriculture]], up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government [[social welfare|welfare]] measures, comfortable living standards, and high dependence on [[foreign trade]]. [[Denmark]] is a net exporter of food. The center-left coalition government is concentrating on reducing the unemployment rate and turning the budget deficit into a surplus, as well as following the previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also vows to maintain a stable currency. The coalition has lowered marginal income tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms; increased research and development funds; and improved welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Denmark chose not to join the 11 other [[European Union]] members who launched the [[euro]] on [[1 January]] [[1999]].

A [[train ferry]] opened about [[1960]] from [[Rodby]], Denmark to [[Puttgarden]], Germany provides a short cut from the Danish capital to Germany.

=== Metros ===

*[[Copenhagen Metro]]: an automated driverless [[metro]] system with 26 trains, 17 stations and 16.8 km of track, operated by [[Serco]].

== Cycle tracks ==

Denmark, and especially [[Odense]] and [[Copenhagen]], are notable for its extensive system for bicycle transportation. Nearly one-fifth of all trips in Copenhagen are by bicycle, and for home-to-work commutes, nearly one third of all trips are by bicycle.
Odense has been appointed the &quot;bicycle-city of the year&quot; because of the vast amount of bicycle-tracks in the town. A complete network of 350 km all-weather serviced tracks are laid out in the town - this is as much as some states in [[Germany]].

*Cycle tracks: Danish cycle tracks comprise of a whole network of road area exclusively designated for bicycle traffic. Generally these cycle tracks run one-way on either side of the road, as a separate lane system between the center of the road, driven on by motor vehicles, and the sidewalk. Where there is parallel parking, the cycle tracks are generally found outside the row of cars, between the parked cars and the sidewalk. Cycle tracks are usually wide enough for two bicycles to ride side-by-side (2.2m), particularly in urban areas. This allows for passing on the lefthand side and a greater space buffer between cyclists and motor vehicles. In Copenhagen's 2002-2012 Cycle Policy, the city described plans to widen some of the lanes to fit 3 bikes across (3.5m) in particularly congested areas. On the main-roads, the roads are usually separated into two or three lanes, each with its own [[traffic lights]] and directional arrows, so as to assist bikers in getting faster from one point to another during rush-hours.

The [[armed forces]] of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], known as '''The Danish Defence''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Det Danske Forsvar'') is charged with the defense of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]].

The [[Chief of Defence (Denmark)|Chief of Defence]] is the head of the Danish Armed Forces, and is head of the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Defence Command]] which is managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]]. Constitutionally, the [[Commander-in-Chief]] is the head of state ([[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]); practically, it is the Cabinet. 

Denmark also has a concept of [[Total defence (Denmark)|Total Defence]].

== Purpose and task ==
The purpose and task of the armed forces of Denmark is defined in Law no. 122 of [[February 27]], [[2001]] and in force since March 1, 2001. It defines 3 purposes and 6 tasks.

Its primary purpose is to prevent conflicts and war, preserve the [[sovereignty]] of Denmark, secure the continuing existence and integrity of the independent Kingdom of Denmark and further a peaceful development in the world with respect to human rights.

Its primary tasks are; [[NATO]] participate in accordance with the strategy of the alliance, detect and repel any sovereignty violation of Danish territory (including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), defence cooperation with non-NATO members, especially central- and East European countries, international missions in the area of conflict prevention, crises-control, humanitarian, peacemaking, peacekeeping, participate in ''Total Defence'' in cooperation with civilian resources and finally maintain a sizable force to execute these tasks at all times.

==Defense budget==
Since [[1988]], Danish defense budgets and security policy have been set by multi-year agreements supported by a wide parliamentary majority including government and opposition parties. However, public opposition to increases in defense spending &amp;ndash; during a period when economic constraints require reduced spending for social welfare &amp;ndash; has created differences among the political parties regarding a broadly acceptable level of new defense expenditure.

The latest Defence agreement (&quot;[[Danish Defence agreement 2005-2009|Defence agreement 2005-2009]]&quot;) was signed [[June 10]], [[2004]], and calls for a significant re-construction of the entire military. From now  about 60% support structure and 40% combat operational capability, it is to be 40% support structure and 60% combat operational capability. E.g. more combat soldiers and less 'paper'-soldiers.
The reaction speed is increased, with an entire [[brigade]] on standby readiness; the military retains the capability to continually deploy 2.000 soldiers in international service or 5.000 over a short time span. The standard mandatory [[conscription]] is modified. Generally this means lesser conscripts, lesser service time for them and only those who choose to will continue into the reaction force system.

===Expenditures===
The Danish military economy is the fifth largest single economy in the Danish Government (the 2005 [[Danish finance law|Finance law]]), significantly less than that of the [[Ministry of Social Affairs of Denmark|Ministry of Social Affairs]] (~100 billion [[DKK]]), [[Ministry of Employment of Denmark|Ministry of Employment]] (~90 billion DKK), [[Ministry of the Interior and Health of Denmark|Ministry of the Interior and Health]] (~50 billion DKK) and [[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Ministry of Education]] (~30 billion DKK) and only slightly larger than that of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (~13 billion DKK). This list lists the complete expenditures for the Danish [[Ministry of Defence of Denmark|Ministry of Defence]].

The Danish defence, counting all branches and all departments, itself has an income equal to about 1-5% of its expenditures, depending on the year. They are not deducted in this listing.

Approximately 95% of the budget goes directly to running the Danish military including the Home guard. Depending on year, 50-53% accounts for payment to personnel, roughly 14-21% on acquiring new material, 2-8% for larger ships, building projects or infrastructure and about 24-27% for others, under here purchasing of goods, renting, maintenance, services and taxes. 

The remaining 5% is special expenditures to NATO, branch shared expenditures, special services and civil structures, here in including running the [[Farvandsvæsen]], [[Danish national rescue preparedness]] and the [[Militærnægteradministrationen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Danish foreign policy''' is founded upon four cornerstones: the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[EU]], and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] cooperation. Denmark also is a member of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]; the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); the [[Council of Europe]]; the [[Nordic Council]]; the [[Baltic Council]]; and the [[Barents Council]]. Denmark emphasizes its relations with developing nations and is one of the few countries to exceed the UN goal of contributing 1% of GNP to development assistance.

In the wake of the [[Cold War]], Denmark has been active in international efforts to integrate the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the West. It has played a leadership role in coordinating Western assistance to the Baltic states ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]). The country is a strong supporter of international peacekeeping. Danish forces were heavily engaged in the former Yugoslavia in the UN Protection Force ([[UNPROFOR]]), with [[IFOR]], and now [[SFOR]].

Following [[World War II]], Denmark ended its two-hundred year long policy of neutrality. Denmark has been a member of NATO since its founding in 1949, and membership in NATO remains highly popular. There were several serious confrontations between the U.S. and Denmark on security policy in the so-called &quot;footnote era&quot; (1982-88), when a hostile parliamentary majority forced the government to adopt specific national positions on nuclear and arms control issues. With the end of the Cold War, however, Denmark has been supportive of U.S. policy objectives in the Alliance. Denmark is not a member of the [[Western European Union]] but does hold observer status.

Danes have enjoyed a reputation as &quot;reluctant&quot; Europeans. When they rejected ratification of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] on June 2, 1992, they put the EC's plans for the European Union on hold. In December 1992, the rest of the EC agreed to exempt Denmark from certain aspects of the European Union, including a common defense, a common currency, EU citizenship, and certain aspects of legal cooperation. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] was approved in the referendum of May 28, 1998. In the autumn of 2000, Danish citizens rejected membership of the [[Euro]] currency group in a referendum.

== Disputes - international: ==
*''[[Rockall]]''. A continental shelf dispute involving [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (Ireland and the UK have signed a boundary agreement in the Rockall area)

*''[[Hans Island]]''. An island located between [[Greenland]] and Canadian Arctic islands.  Unresolved boundary disputed between [[Canada]] and Denmark (Denmark controls Greenland's foreign relations). This dispute flared up again in July 2005 following the visit of a Canadian minister to the disputed island. 

*''[[North Pole]]''. Denmark is trying to prove that the [[North Pole]] is geographically connected to Greenland. If such proof is established, Denmark will claim the North Pole.

*''Maritime border with Poland''. [[Denmark]] and [[Poland]] have still not agreed on the location of the maritime border between the two countries. Denmark supports a border half-way between the two countries; Poland wants to be awarded an even greater share of the Baltic Sea, since Poland has a much longer coast-line than the Danish island of [[Bornholm]].

The '''Republic of Djibouti''' ({{lang-ar|: جيبوتي}}, ''Ǧībūtī'') is a country in [[eastern Africa]], located in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Djibouti is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. On the other side of the Red Sea, on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], 20 kilometres (12&amp;nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) from the coast of Djibouti, is [[Yemen]].

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Djibouti]]''

The area of Djibouti has been occupied by several tribes,  currently the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] and the [[Somali (ethnicity)|Somali]] Issa. These tribes had regular trade contacts with the Arabs, and adopted [[Islam]] as their religion.

In the [[19th century]], [[France]] established a [[protectorate]] in the area, named '''French Somaliland''', governed by [[Léonce Lagarde]]. In [[1967]], the name was changed to the '''French Territory of the Afars and the Issas'''. On [[June 27]], [[1977]], the country was granted independence as '''Djibouti'''.

A civil war led by Afar rebels in the early [[1990s]] was stopped by a peace accord in [[1994]].

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Djibouti]]''

Ismail Omar Guelleh was in 2005 sworn in for a second and final six-year term as president of the tiny Horn of Africa nation, the official news agency, Agence Djiboutienne d'Information (ADI), reported. Guelleh won 100 percent of the votes cast in a one-man race on [[8 April]]. According to ADI, 78.9 percent of approximately 197,000 registered voters cast their ballots - at 200 voting booths - across the country. Opposition parties boycotted, describing the poll as &quot;ridiculous, rigged and rubbish&quot;. Present at the swearing in ceremony were several regional leaders. 

Djibouti's second president, Guelleh was first elected to office in 1999, taking over from his uncle, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who had ruled the country since its independence from France in 1977. {{ref|www.irinnews.org.319}}

The head of state of Djibouti is the president, who is elected for a term of six years. The president appoints a prime-minister, and heads the council of ministers. 

The legislative body is formed by the ''Chambre des Deputes'', which consists of 65 members which are elected every five years.

==Subdivisions==
[[Image:Djibouti-regions.png|right|150px|Map of the Regions of Djibouti.]]
Djibouti is divided into five [[region]]s and one city.

* [[Ali Sabieh Region]] (''Region d'Ali Sabieh'')
* [[Arta Region]] (''Region d'Arta'')
* [[Dikhil Region]] (''Region de Dikhil'')
* [[Djibouti (city)]] (''Ville de Djibouti'')
* [[Obock Region]] (''Region d'Obock'')
* [[Tadjourah Region]] (''Region de Tadjourah'')

==Economy==
''Main article: [[Economy of Djibouti]]''

The economy of Djibouti is based on service activities connected with the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scant rainfall limits crop production to [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and most food must be imported.

Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural resources and little [[industry]]. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An [[unemployment]] rate of 40% to 50% continues to be a major problem. [[Inflation]] is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the [[Djiboutian franc|franc]] to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last seven years because of [[recession]], [[civil war]], and a high [[population growth rate]] (including immigrants and refugees). Also, renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has disturbed normal external channels of commerce. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen into arrears on long-term external debt and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.
[[Image:Djibouti_street.jpg|thumbnail|Typical street in the city of Djibouti, Djibouti, Africa.  Winter, 2005.]]
==Demographics==
{{unreferencedsect}}
''Main article: [[Demographics of Djibouti]]''

The population is divided into two main groups, the [[Issa]], or [[Somali (ethnicity)|Somali]] people, who make up about 60%, and the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]], about 35%. The remainder is formed by [[Europe]]ans (mostly [[France|French]] and [[Italy|Italians]]), [[Arab]]s and [[Ethiopia]]ns. The presence of two different population groups was the cause of the civil war in the early [[1990s]].

The Somali ethnic component in Djibouti is mainly composed of the Issas, who form the majority and rule the nation, and the Gadabuursi and Isaaq, all of whom are closely related as [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] subclans. The Issas form part of the Madoobe Dir, while the Gadabuursi and Isaaq are part of the Mahe Dir, Mohammed Hiniftire. Other Somalis in Djibouti include [[Issa]]s from the Ethiopian [[Somali Region]] and from northern Somalia.

Almost all of the people of Djibouti are [[Muslim]], only a small percentage are [[Christianity|Christian]], notably the [[European]]s.

Although [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are the official languages, [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Afar language|Afar]] are widely spoken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Djibouti|Republic of Djibouti]] gained its independence on [[June 27]], [[1977]]. It is the successor to [[French Somaliland]] (later called the [[Afars and Issas|French Territory of the Afars and Issas]]), which was created in the first half of the 19th century as a result of French interest in the [[Horn of Africa]]. However, the history of Djibouti, recorded in poetry and songs of its nomadic peoples, goes back thousands of years to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], and [[China]]. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar tribes in this region became among the first on the [[African]] continent to adopt [[Islam]].

==French Interest==
[[Image:Djibouti-c1905.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Place Menelik, Djibouti, c1905.]]It was [[Rochet d'Hericourt]]'s exploration into [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]] (1839-42) that marked the beginning of French interest in the African shores of the [[Red Sea]]. Further exploration by [[Henri Lambert]], French Consular Agent at Aden, and Captain [[Fleuriot de Langle]] led to a treaty of friendship and assistance between France and the sultans of [[Raheita]], [[Tadjoura]], and [[Gobaad]], from whom the French purchased the anchorage of [[Obock]] in [[1862]].

Growing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. In 1884-85, [[France]] expanded its protectorate to include the shores of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] and the [[Somaliland]], installing [[Léonce Lagarde]] as governor of this protectorate. Boundaries of the protectorate, marked out in 1897 by France and [[Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia]], were reaffirmed by agreements with [[Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] in 1945 and 1954.

The administrative capital was moved from Obock to Djibouti in [[1896]]. [[Djibouti, Djibouti|Djibouti]], which has a good natural harbor and ready access to the Ethiopian highlands, attracted trade caravans crossing East Africa as well as Somali settlers from the south. The [[Franco-Ethiopian railway]], linking Djibouti to the heart of Ethiopia, was begun in 1897 and reached [[Addis Ababa]] in June 1917, increasing the volume of trade passing through the port.

==World War II==
During the Italian invasion and occupation of Ethiopia in the 1930s and during World War II, constant border skirmishes occurred between French and Italian forces. The area was ruled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy (French) government]] from the fall of France until December 1942, and fell under British blockade during that period. Free French and the Allied forces recaptured Djibouti at the end of 1942. A local battalion from Djibouti participated in the liberation of France in 1944.

==Reform==
On July 22, 1957, the colony was reorganized to give the people considerable self-government. On the same day, a decree applying the Overseas Reform Act (Loi Cadre) of [[June 23]], [[1956]], established a territorial assembly that elected eight of its members to an executive council. Members of the executive council were responsible for one or more of the territorial services and carried the title of minister. The council advised the French-appointed governor general.

In a September 1958 constitutional referendum, French Somaliland opted to join the French community as an overseas territory. This act entitled the region to representation by one deputy and one senator in the [[French Parliament]], and one counselor in the [[French Union]] Assembly.

The first elections to the territorial assembly were held on November 23, 1958, under a system of proportional representation. In the next assembly elections (1963), a new electoral law was enacted. Representation was abolished in exchange for a system of straight plurality vote based on lists submitted by political parties in seven designated districts. [[Ali Aref Bourhan]], allegedly of Turkish origin, was selected to be the president of the executive council. French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s August 1966 visit to Djibouti was marked by 2 days of public demonstrations by Somalis demanding independence. On [[September 21]], [[1966]], [[Louis Saget]], appointed governor general of the territory after the demonstrations, announced the French Government's decision to hold a referendum to determine whether the people would remain within the French Republic or become independent. In March 1967, 60% chose to continue the territory's association with France.

In July of that year, a directive from Paris formally changed the name of the region to the French Territory of Afars and Issas. The directive also reorganized the governmental structure of the territory, making the senior French representative, formerly the governor general, a high commissioner. In addition, the executive council was redesignated as the council of government, with nine members.

==Independence==
In 1975, the French Government began to accommodate increasingly insistent demands for independence. In June 1976, the territory's citizenship law, which favored the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] minority, was revised to reflect more closely the weight of the Issa Somali. The electorate voted for independence in a May 1977 referendum, and the Republic of Djibouti was established June that same year. [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]] became the country's first president.

In 1981, Aptidon turned the country into a one party state by declaring that his party, the Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progrès (RPP) ([[People's Rally for Progress]]), was the sole legal one. Civil war broke out in 1991, between the government and a predominantly [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] rebel group, the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD). The FRUD signed a peace accord with the government in December 1994, ending the conflict. Two FRUD members were made cabinet members, and in the presidential elections of 1999 the FRUD campaigned in support of the RPP. 

Aptidon resigned as president 1999, at the age of 83, after being elected to a fifth term in 1997. His successor was his nephew, [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]].

On May 12, 2001, President Ismail Omar Guelleh presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the FRUD. The peace accord successfully completed the peace process begun on February 7, 2000 in Paris. Ahmed Dini Ahmed represented the FRUD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Djibouti}}
'''Politics of Djibouti''' takes place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]], [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. The party system is dominated by the conservative [[People's Rally for Progress]].
==Political developments==
In 1981, [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]] was elected as President of [[Djibouti]]. He was re-elected, unopposed, to a second 6-year term in April 1987 and to a third 6-year term in May 1993 multiparty elections. The electorate approved the current constitution in September 1992. Many laws and decrees from before independence remain in effect.

In early 1992, the government decided to permit multiple party politics and agreed to the registration of four political parties. By the time of the national assembly elections in December 1992, only three had qualified. They are the ''Rassemblement Populaire Pour le Progres'' ([[People's Rally for Progress]]) (RPP) which was the only legal party from 1981 until 1992, the ''Parti du Renouveau Democratique'' (The [[Party for Democratic Renewal]]) (PRD), and the ''Parti National Democratique'' ([[National Democratic Party]]) (PND). Only the RPP and the PRD contested the national assembly elections, and the PND withdrew, claiming that there were too many unanswered questions on the conduct of the elections and too many opportunities for government fraud. The RPP won all 65 seats in the national assembly, with a turnout of less than 50% of the electorate.

In 1999, President Hassan Gouled Aptidon's chief of staff, head of security, and key advisor for over 20 years, [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] was elected to the Presidency as the RPP candidate. He received 74% of the vote, the other 26% going to opposition candidate [[Moussa Ahmed Idriss]], of the [[Unified Djiboutian Opposition]] (ODU). For the first time since independence, no group boycotted the election. Moussa Ahmed Idriss and the ODU later challenged the results based on election &quot;irregularities&quot; and the assertion that &quot;foreigners&quot; had voted in various districts of the capital; however, international and locally based observers considered the election to be generally fair, and cited only minor technical difficulties. Ismail Omar Guelleh took the oath of office as the second President of the Republic of Djibouti on [[May 8]], [[1999]], with the support of an alliance between the RPP and the government-recognized section of the Afar-led FRUD.

Currently, political power is shared by a Somali president and an Afar prime minister, with cabinet posts roughly divided. However, it is the Issas who presently dominate the government, civil service, and the ruling party, a situation that has bred resentment and political competition between the Somali Issas and the Afars.

In early November 1991, civil war erupted in Djibouti between the government and a predominantly Afar rebel group, the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD). The FRUD signed a peace accord with the government in December 1994, ending the conflict. Two FRUD members were made cabinet members, and in the presidential elections of 1999 the FRUD campaigned in support of the RPP. In February 2000, another branch of FRUD signed a peace accord with the government.

On [[12 May]] [[2001]], President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the FRUD. The peace accord successfully completed the peace process begun on [[7 February]] [[2000]] in Paris. [[Ahmed Dini Ahmed]] represented the FRUD.

Djibouti has its own armed forces, including a small army, which has grown significantly since the start of the civil war. In recent years the armed force has downsized and with the peace accord with the FRUD in 2001, the armed forces are expected to continue its downsizing. The country's security also is supplemented by a special security arrangement with the Government of [[France]]. France maintains one of its largest military bases outside France in Djibouti. There are some 2,600 French troops, which includes a unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]], stationed in Djibouti.

The right to own property is respected in Djibouti. The government has reorganized the [[labor union]]s. While there have been open elections of union leaders, the Government of Djibouti is working with the ILO to hold new elections.

Although women in Djibouti enjoy a higher public status than in many other [[Islam]]ic countries, women's rights and family planning face difficult challenges, many stemming from poverty. Few women hold senior positions. Education of girls still lags behind boys and, because of the high unemployment rate, employment opportunities are better for male applicants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Djibouti]]'s fledgling economy depends on a large foreign expatriate community, the maritime and commercial activities of the Port of Djibouti, its airport, and the operation of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad. During the civil war (1991-94), there was a significant diversion of government budgetary resources from developmental and social services to military needs. [[France]] is insisting that future aid be conditional on an overhaul of Djibouti's dilapidated state finances in conjunction with the [[International Monetary Fund]]. [[Agriculture]] and [[industry]] are little developed, in part due to the harsh climate, high production costs, [[unskilled labor]], and limited [[natural resources]]. Only a few [[mineral]] deposits exist in the country, and the arid soil is unproductive--89% is desert wasteland, 10% is pasture, and 1% is forested. Services and commerce provide most of the gross domestic product.

Djibouti's most important economic asset is its strategic location on the shipping routes between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]--the Republic lies on the west side of the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], which connects the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. Its port is an important transshipment point for containers. It also functions as a bunkering port and a small French naval facility. Business increased at Djibouti port when hostilities between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] denied Ethiopia access to the Eritrean port of Assab. Djibouti became the only significant port for landlocked Ethiopia, handling all its imports and exports, including huge shipments of U.S. food aid in 2000 during the drought and famine. In 2000, Jebel Ali Port Mangers, who manage the port of Dubai, took over management of Djibouti&amp;rsquo;s port. This was part of a regional management scheme that also included the port of Beirut. As a result, the Port of Djibouti has increased its efficiency and is positioned to be a major port and transshipment port for the Red Sea.

The [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad]] is the only line serving central and southeastern Ethiopia. The single-track railway--a prime source of employment--occupies a prominent place in Ethiopia's internal distribution system for domestic commodities such as cement, cotton textiles, sugar, cereals and charcoal.

Principal exports from the region transiting Djibouti are [[coffee]], [[salt]], hides, dried [[bean]]s, [[cereal]]s, other agricultural products, and [[wax]]. Djibouti itself has few exports, and the majority of its imports come from France. Most imports are consumed in Djibouti, and the remainder goes to Ethiopia and northwestern [[Somalia]]. Djibouti's unfavorable [[balance of trade]] is offset partially by invisible earnings such as transit taxes and harbor dues. In 1999, U.S. exports to Djibouti totaled $26.7 million while U.S. imports from Djibouti were less than $100,000.

The city of Djibouti has the only paved airport in the republic. Djibouti has one of the most liberal economic regimes in Africa, with almost unrestricted banking and commerce sectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Djibouti]]'s military and economic agreements with [[France]] provide continued security and economic assistance. Links with Arab states and East Asian states, [[Japan]] and [[People's Republic of China]] in particular, also are welcome. Djibouti is a member of the [[Arab League]], as well as the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), and the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD). After the terror attacks of [[September 11]], [[2001]], Djibouti joined the Global War on Terror, and now hosts a large military camp, home to soldiers from many countries, but primarily the U.S. The U.S. and Djibouti have forged strong ties in recent years. Foreign Aid from the U.S. plays the lead role in Djibouti's economy.

Djibouti is greatly affected by events in [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]], and therefore relations are important and, at times, very delicate. The fall of the [[Siad Barre]] and [[Mengistu]] governments in Somalia and Ethiopia, respectively, in 1991, caused Djibouti to face national security threats due to the instability in the neighboring states and a massive influx of refugees estimated at 100,000 from Somalia and Ethiopia. In 2000, after 3 years of insufficient rain, 50,000 drought victims entered Djibouti. In 1996 a revitalized organization of seven East African states, the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD), established its secretariat in Djibouti. IGAD’s mandate is for regional cooperation and economic integration. In 1991 and 2000, Djibouti played a key role in the search for peace in Somalia by hosting Somali Reconciliation Conferences. In the summer of 2000, Djibouti hosted the Arta Conference which brought together various Somali clans and warlords. Djibouti's efforts to promote reconciliation in Somalia led to the establishment of the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) in Somalia. Djibouti hopes the TNG can form the basis for bringing peace and stability to Somalia.

With the Ethiopia-Eritrea war of 2000, Ethiopia channeled most of its trade through Djibouti. Though Djibouti is nominally neutral, it broke off relations with Eritrea in November 1998, renewing relations in 2000. Eritrea's President Isaias visited Djibouti in early 2001 and President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] made a reciprocal visit to Asmara in the early summer of 2001. While Djibouti’s President Ismail Omar Guelleh has close ties with Ethiopia’s ruling [[Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), he has tried to maintain an even hand, developing relations with [[Eritrea]].

Djibouti has been the host country for [[Military of France|French]] military units since independence.  In [[2002]], [[Military of the United States|United States]] units began operations from Djibouti with the aim of countering the possible threat of Islamic terrorism in the [[Horn of Africa]].

[[Somalia]] has in the past claimed the areas of Djibouti inhabited by [[Somali]]s as part of the [[Greater Somalia]] idea.

The '''Commonwealth of Dominica,''' popularly known as '''Dominica''', is an [[island nation]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]].  It should not be confused with the [[Dominican Republic]], another Caribbean nation.  

The name is pronounced [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/&amp;#716;d&amp;#594;.m&amp;#618;n&amp;#712;i&amp;#720;.k&amp;#601;/}} (&quot;do-min-EE-ka&quot;). In [[Latin]] the name means &quot;Sunday&quot;, which was the day of its 'discovery' by Europeans (i.e. Columbus).

Dominica's [[pre-Columbian]] name is ''Wai'tu kubuli'', which means &quot;Tall is her body.&quot; The Kalinago (Indigenous) people of the island, somewhat erroneously called 'Caribs', have a territory which resembles the 'Indian' reserves of Canada. Because it lies between two overseas [[départements]] (territories) of [[France]],  [[Guadeloupe]] to the north and [[Martinique]] to the south, and due to a considerable historical influence from France, the island is sometimes called &quot;French Dominica.&quot;   The island is also nicknamed &quot;''The Nature Isle of the Caribbean''&quot; due to its seemingly unspoiled natural beauty.  

Dominica is a lush island of mountainous [[rainforests]], home of many rare plant, animal and bird species. The Sisserou parrot is featured on the Dominica flag. The isle of Dominica is one of the youngest islands in the [[Lesser Antilles]], and it is still being formed by [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]-[[volcano|volcanic]] activity.  Dominica's economy is heavily dependent on both tourism and agriculture.

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Dominica]]''

Dominica was first sighted by Europeans, including [[Christopher Columbus]], in [[1493]].  They encountered the [[indigenous]] peoples known as the [[Carib]]s, but soon left the island after being defeated by the Caribs.  In [[1627]] [[Kingdom of England|England]] also tried and failed to capture Dominica.  In [[1635]] the French claimed the island and sent missionaries, but were unable to wrench Dominica from the Caribs.  They abandoned the island, along with the island of [[Saint Vincent_(island)|Saint Vincent]], in the [[1660]]s.

For the next hundred years Dominica remained isolated, and even more Caribs settled there after being driven from surrounding islands as [[European]] powers entered the region.  [[France]] formally ceded possession of Dominica to the United Kingdom in [[1763]]. The United Kingdom then set up a government and made the island a colony in [[1805]].  The emancipation of African slaves occurred throughout the British Empire in [[1834]], and, by [[1838]], Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a Black-controlled legislature.  In [[1896]], the United Kingdom re-took governmental control of Dominica and turned it into a [[crown colony]].  Half a century later, from  [[1958]] to [[1962]], Dominica became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].  In [[1978]] Dominica finally became an independent nation.  Dominica's fortunes improved in [[1980]] when its corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of [[Mary Eugenia Charles]], the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years.

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of Dominica]]''

Dominica is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The President is [[head of state]], while executive power rests with the [[Cabinet]], headed by the [[Prime Minister]]. The [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] consists of the 30-member House of Assembly, which consists of twenty-one directly elected members and nine Senators, who may either be appointed by the President or elected by the other members of the House.

Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a [[Commonwealth realm]] with the [[British monarch]] as [[head of state]], as it instead became a [[republic]] on independence.

Dominica is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean_Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

==Parishes==
''Main article: [[Parishes of Dominica]]''

Dominica is divided into ten parishes, each named after a [[saint]].
The parishes are: St. Luke, St. Mark, St. George, St. Paul, St. St Joseph, St. Peter, 
St. Andrew, St. David, St. Patrick, St. John.

==Geography==
[[Image:Do-map.gif|thumb|280px|Map of Dominica]]
''Main article: [[Geography of Dominica]]''

Dominica is an [[island nation]] and [[borderless country]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]].  The size of the country is about 751 square kilometers (290 square miles).   The capital is [[Roseau]].  

Dominica is largely covered by [[rainforest]] and is home to the world's second-largest [[boiling lake]].  Dominica also has many waterfalls, springs and rivers.  Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.  The volcanic nature of the island and the lack of sandy beaches have made Dominica a popular [[scuba diving]] spot.

The Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with [[Venezuela]] over Venezuela's territorial claims to the sea surrounding [[Isla Aves]] (Bird Island), a tiny islet located 110 km (70 miles) west of the island of Dominica.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Dominica}}

The Dominican economy is dependent on both [[tourism]] and [[agriculture]].  Forty percent of Dominican workers are in the [[agricultural sector]], and Dominica's primary agricultural [[exports]] include [[tobacco]], [[bananas]], [[vegetables]], [[citrus]], [[copra]], [[coconut oil]], and [[essential oils]] such as [[bay leaf|bay oil]].  The country's industries, other than tourism, include [[soap]], [[furniture]], cement blocks, and [[shoes]].  Dominica is further benefited by the presence of an offshore medical school, [http://www.rossmed.edu/ Ross University], in the northern town of Portsmouth. About 900 students live and study in Portsmouth.

The Dominican economy has high [[poverty]] (30%), high [[unemployment]] (23%), and a low per capita [[GDP]] (US$5,400).  The Dominican economy has been hurt by problems in the banana industry.  The entire economy suffers when weather conditions damage the banana crop, or when the price of bananas falls.  The [[European Union]] has phased out preferred access of bananas to its markets, causing banana demand to fall.  In response, the Dominican government privatized the banana industry.  Also, the government has attempted to diversify the economy and has lifted [[price controls]] in an attempt to improve the lagging economy.  The government is also trying to develop tourism, especially [[ecotourism]].  The lack of a large international airport and lack of sandy beaches decrease opportunities for standard tourism, but the heavily rainforested island could lure those who want unconventional ecotourism experiences.  Indeed, it is remarked that of all the islands of the Caribbean, Dominica is the only one [[Christopher Columbus]] would still recognise.

==Demographics==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Dominica]]''

Almost all of the seventy thousand nationals of Dominica today are descendants of African slaves, brought in by colonial planters in the 18th century.  However, Dominica is also one of the few islands in the Eastern Caribbean to possess a population of pre-Columbian Carib Indians, about 3,000 of whom live on the island's east coast in their own territory.

The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to more developed Caribbean Islands, the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada.  English is the official language of Dominica and is universally understood; however, because of historic French domination, Antillean Creole &quot;[[Patwa]]&quot;, a French-based [[creole language]], is also widely spoken. About 80% of the population is Catholic, though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established.

==Culture==
''Main article: [[Culture of Dominica]]''

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Historically occupied by several native tribes, only a [[Carib]] tribe remained by the time European settlers reached the island. French and British settlers each claimed the island, and imported [[slaves]] from [[Africa]]. The native Caribs have a reserve on which they live in their traditional manner. This mix of cultures is important to Dominica.

The famed novelist [[Jean Rhys]] was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]], set her [[1954]] novel, ''[[The Orchid House]]'' ISBN 081352332X, in Dominica.
 
The dialect of Dominica also includes Cocoy and a French Patios. &quot;Cocoy&quot;, is primarly a mix of cockney english imported by English settler and with an infusion of African lingual. Cocoy is mainly spoken in the north-eastern part of the island. The French patios which is more widely spoken came from the French plantation owners from the neighbouring French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The island of '''[[Dominica]]''''s indigenous [[Arawak]] people were expelled or exterminated by [[Carib]]s in the 14th century. [[Christopher Columbus]] landed there in November [[1493]]. [[Spain|Spanish]] ships frequently landed on Dominica during the 16th century, but fierce resistance by the Caribs discouraged Spain's efforts at settlement.

In [[1635]], [[France]] claimed Dominica. Shortly thereafter, French missionaries became the first European inhabitants of the island. Carib incursions continued, though, and in [[1660]], the French and [[United Kingdom|British]] agreed that both Dominica and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent]] should be abandoned. Dominica was officially neutral for the next century, but the attraction of its resources remained; rival expeditions of British and French foresters were harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century.

Largely due to Dominica's position between [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], France eventually became predominant, and a French settlement was established and grew. As part of the [[1763]] [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[Seven Years' War]], the island became a British possession. In [[1778]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the French mounted a successful invasion with the active cooperation of the population, which was largely French. The [[1783]] Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, returned the island to Britain. French invasions in [[1795]] and [[1805]] ended in failure.

In 1763, the British established a legislative assembly, representing only the white population. In [[1831]], reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes, the [[Brown Privilege Bill]] conferred political and social rights on free nonwhites. Three Blacks were elected to the legislative assembly the following year. Following the abolition of slavery, in [[1838]] Dominica became the first and only British Caribbean colony to have a Black-controlled legislature in the 19th century. Most Black legislators were small holders or merchants who held economic and social views diametrically opposed to the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.

In [[1865]], after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one comprised of one-half elected members and one-half appointed. The elected legislators were outmaneuvered on numerous occasions by planters allied with colonial administrators. In [[1871]], Dominica became part of the [[Leeward Island Federation]]. The power of the Black population progressively eroded. Crown Colony government was re-established in [[1896]]. All political rights for the vast majority of the population were effectively curtailed. [[Development aid]], offered as compensation for disenfranchisement, proved to have a negligible effect.

Following [[World War I]], an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the representative government association. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in [[1924]] and one-half in [[1936]]. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration and was governed as part of the [[Windward Islands|Windwards]] until [[1958]], when it joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].

In [[1961]], a Dominica Labor Party government led by [[Edward Oliver LeBlanc]] was elected. After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom on [[February 27]], [[1967]] and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. LeBlanc retired in [[1974]] and was replaced by [[Patrick John]]. On [[November 3]], [[1978]], the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence by the United Kingdom.

Independence did little to solve problems stemming from centuries of economic [[underdevelopment]], and in mid-[[1979]], political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. It was replaced after the [[1980]] elections by a government led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]], the Caribbean's first female prime minister. 

On [[April 27]], [[1981]], [[Ku Klux Klan]] Grand Wizards [[Don Black (nationalist)|Don Black]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]], [[Larry Lloyd Jacklin]] and seven other men were arrested by [[United States|U.S.]] federal agents in [[New Orleans]] as they prepared to board a boat with guns and dynamite for an invasion of Dominica. The invasion (dubbed &quot;[[Operation Red Dog]]&quot; by its organizers) was meant to restore [[Patrick John]] to power and to transform the island into a white supremacist nation. The incident was later dubbed the &quot;Bayou of Pigs.&quot;

Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980. By the end of the 1980s, the economy had made a healthy recovery, which weakened in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices.

In 1995 the government was defeated in elections by the United Workers Party of [[Edison James]]. James became prime minister, serving until the February 2000 elections, when the [[Dominica United Workers Party]] (DUWP) was defeated by the [[Dominica Labour Party]] (DLP), led by [[Rosie Douglas]]. He was a former [[socialist]] [[radical]], and many feared that his approach to politics might be impractical. However, these were somewhat quieted when he formed a coalition with the more conservative Dominica Freedom Party. Douglas died suddenly after only a few months in office, on October 1, 2000, and was replaced by [[Pierre Charles]], also of the DLP. In 2003, [[Nicholas Liverpool]] was elected and sworn in as president, succeeding [[Vernon Shaw]].. On January 6, 2004, Prime Minister Pierre Charles, who had been suffering from heart problems since 2003, died. He became the second consecutive prime minister of Dominica to die in office of a heart attack. The foreign minister, [[Osborne Riviere]] immediately became prime minister, but the education minister, [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] succeeded him as prime minister and became the new leader of the Dominica Labour Party. Election were held on [[May 5]] [[2005]] with the ruling coalition maintaining power.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:DominicaMap.gif|thumb|300px|Map of Dominica]]
[[Dominica]] is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], located about halfway between [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  Its coordinates are 15 25 N, 61 20 W.  The island is roughly four times the size of [[Washington, DC]] (in area, not population).  There are no significant lakes on the island.

The island's [[climate]] is tropical, moderated by northeast [[trade wind]]s and heavy [[rain]]fall.  The interior features rugged [[mountain]]s of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. Volcanism is still quite evident on the island, the most popular examples being Dominica's boiling lake and &quot;valley of desolation.&quot; The boiling lake (the world's second largest) is within a crater and is fed by a waterfall - the boiling is believed to be caused by the heat of a magma chamber beneath the lake. The valley of desolation is a sulfurous valley of volcanic vents and hot springs that inhibits significant plant growth - in stark contrast to the surrounding rain forest. The lowest point in the country is at [[sea level]] along the coast, and the highest is [[Morne Diablotins]] (1,447 m).  The extreme southwestern coast of the island includes a large collapsed submarine caldera. Portions of the exposed rim of this caldera form the southwestern tip of the island at Scott's Head. 

Natural resources include [[farming]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].

Geographically, Dominica is distinctive in many ways. The country has one of the most rugged landscapes in the Caribbean, covered by a largely unexploited, multi-layered rain forest. It is also among the earth's most rain-drenched lands, and the water runoff forms cascading rivers and natural pools. The island, home to rare species of wildlife, is considered by many as a beautiful, unspoiled tropical preserve. According to a popular West Indian belief, Dominica is the only New World territory that Columbus would still recognize.

Dominica is the largest and most northerly of the Windward Islands. The island faces the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the west. Its nearest neighbors are the French islands of Guadeloupe, some forty-eight kilometers north, and Martinique, about forty kilometers south. Oblong-shaped and slightly smaller than New York City, Dominica is 750 square kilometers in area, 47 kilometers in length, and 29 kilometers in width. Roseau, the nation's capital and major port, is favorably situated on the sheltered, southwestern coast.

Geologically, Dominica is part of the rugged Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from 300 meters to 1,400 meters above sea level. Several east-west trending mountain spurs extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has level stretches no wider than 2,000 meters. The highest peak is Morne Diablatins, at 1,447 meters; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of 1,423 meters, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.

Dominica's rugged surface is marked by its volcanic past. Rock formations are mainly volcanic andesite and rhyolite, with fallen boulders and sharp-edged protrusions peppering slope bases. The light- to dark-hued clayey and sandy soils, derived from the rocks and decomposed vegetation, are generally fertile and porous. Only a few interior valleys and coastal strips are flat enough for soil accumulations of consequence, however. Although scores of mostly mild seismic shocks were recorded in 1986, volcanic eruptions ceased thousands of years ago. Sulfuric springs and steam vents, largely concentrated in the central and southern parts of the island, remain active, however. One of the largest springs, Boiling Lake, is located in the national park.

Dominica is water-rich with swift-flowing highland streams, which cascade into deep gorges and form natural pools and crater lakes. The streams are not navigable, but many are sources of hydroelectric power. Trafalgar Falls, located near the national park, is one of the most spectacular sites on the island. The principal rivers flowing westward into the Caribbean are the Layou and the Roseau, and the major one emptying eastward into the Atlantic is the Toulaman. The largest crater lake, called Boeri, is located in the national park.

Dominica has a tropical wet climate with characteristically warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Excessive heat and humidity are tempered somewhat by a steady flow of the northeast trade winds, which periodically develop into hurricanes. The steep interior slopes also alter temperatures and winds. Temperature ranges are slight. Average daytime temperatures generally vary from 26°C in January to 32°C in June. Diurnal ranges are usually no greater than 3°C in most places, but temperatures dipping to 13°C on the highest peaks are not uncommon.

Most of the island's ample supply of water is brought by the trade winds. Although amounts vary with the location, rain is possible throughout the year, with the greatest monthly totals recorded from June through October. Average yearly rainfall along the windward east coast frequently exceeds 500 centimeters, and exposed mountainsides receive up to 900 centimeters, among the highest accumulations in the world. Totals on the leeward west coast, however, are only about 180 centimeters per year. Humidities are closely tied to rainfall patterns, with the highest values occurring on windward slopes and the lowest in sheltered areas. Relative humidity readings between 70 percent and 90 percent have been recorded in Roseau.

Hurricanes and severe winds, most likely to occur during the wettest months, occasionally are devastating. The most recent hurricanes of note were David and Frederick in August 1979 and Allen in August l980. The 1979 hurricanes caused over 40 deaths, 2,500 injuries, and extensive destruction of housing and crops. Many agricultural commodities were destroyed during the 1980 storm, and about 25 percent of the banana crop was demolished by strong winds in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost all [[Dominica]]ns are descendants of [[Africa]]n [[Slavery|slave]]s brought in by [[colony|colonial]] planters in the [[18th century]]. Dominica is the only island in the eastern [[Caribbean]] to retain some of its pre-Columbian population--the [[Carib]] Indians--about 3,000 of whom live on the island's east coast.

The population growth rate is very low, due primarily to emigration to more prosperous Caribbean Islands, the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. [[English language|English]] is the official language and universally understood; however, because of historic [[French language|French]] domination, [[Antillean Creole]], a French patois, is also widely spoken. About 80% of the population is [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]. In recent years, a number of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches have been established.

'''Politics of Dominica''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Dominica]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

A president and prime minister make up the executive branch. Nominated by the prime minister in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, the president is elected for a 5-year term by the parliament. The president appoints as prime minister the leader of the majority party in the parliament and also appoints, on the prime minister's recommendation, members of the parliament from the ruling party as cabinet ministers. The prime minister and cabinet are responsible to the parliament and can be removed on a no-confidence vote. 

==Legislative branch==
The [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] has 32 members, 21 members elected for a five year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], 9 appointed senators, the Speaker and 1 ex-officio member. a [[head of state]] - the [[president]] -  is elected by the House of Assembly. is composed of 21 regional representatives and nine senators. The regional representatives decide whether senators are to be elected or appointed. If appointed, five are chosen by the president with the advice of the prime minister and four with the advice of the opposition leader. If elected, it is by vote of the regional representatives. Elections for representatives and senators must be held at least every 5 years, although the prime minister can call elections any time. 
Dominica has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]], with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. Dominica was once a three-party system, but in the past few years the [[Dominica Labour Party]] and the greatly diminished [[Dominica Freedom Party]] have built a coalition.

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|List of political parties in Dominica|Elections in Dominica}}
{{Dominica legislative election, 2005}}

==Judicial branch==
Dominica's legal system is based on English common law. There are three magistrate's courts, with appeals made to the Eastern Caribbean court of appeal and, ultimately, to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in [[London]]. The [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (located in Saint Lucia), one of the six judges must reside in Dominica and preside over the Court of Summary Jurisdiction.

==Administrative divisions==
Councils elected by universal suffrage govern most towns. Supported largely by property taxation, the councils are responsible for the regulation of markets and sanitation and the maintenance of secondary roads and other municipal amenities. The island also is divided into 10 parishes, whose governance is unrelated to the town governments: Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph, Saint Luke, Saint Mark, Saint Patrick, Saint Paul, Saint Peter.

==International organization participation==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like its [[Eastern Caribbean]] neighbors, the main priority of [[Dominica]]'s foreign relations is economic development. The country maintains missions in Washington, New York, London, and Brussels and is represented jointly with other [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) members in [[Canada]]. Dominica is also a member of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 1978 and of the [[World Bank]] and [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1979.

As a member of [[CARICOM]], in July 1994 Dominica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[UN Security Council Resolution 940]], designed to facilitate the departure of [[Haiti]]'s de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force, which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

In May 1997, Prime Minister James joined 14 other Caribbean leaders, and President Clinton, during the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]]. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counternarcotics issues, finance and development, and trade.

Dominica previously maintained official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]], but on March 23 a joint communique was signed in Beijing, paving the way for diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic. Beijing responded to Domica's severing relations with the Republic of China by giving them a $112 million aid package, which includes $6 million in budget support for the year 2004 and $1 million annually for six years.

[[Image:Dominican_republic_sm03.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Dominican Republic]]
The '''Dominican Republic''', ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República Dominicana'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[re'puβlika domini'kana]}}) is a country located on the eastern two-thirds of the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]], bordering [[Haiti]]. Hispaniola is the second-largest of the [[Greater Antilles]] islands, and lies west of [[Puerto Rico]] and east of [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]]. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule lasted for much of the [[20th century]]; the move towards [[representative democracy]] has improved vastly since the death of military dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] in [[1961]]. Dominicans sometimes refer to their country as '''Quisqueya''', a name for Hispaniola used by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Taíno]] people. The Dominican Republic is not to be confused with [[Dominica]], another Caribbean country.  

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of the Dominican Republic]]''
The country has had a history of changing ownership, with occasional attempts at independence and self-rule.  First a [[Spanish empire|Spanish colony]] and then a [[French colonial empires|French colony]], it was subsequently ruled by Haiti and then Spain again, and later the [[United States]] twice ruled Dominican territory.

In the beginning the island was primarily inhabited by the [[Taíno]], a branch of the [[Arawaks]]. ''Taíno'' means &quot;the good&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; in that native language. A system of [[Cacique|Cacicazgos]] ([[chiefdom]]s) was in place, and Marien, Maguana, Higuey, Magua and Xaragua (Also written as Jaragua) were their names. These chiefdoms were then subdivided into subchiefdoms. The Cacicazgos were based on a system of [[tribute]], consisting of the food grown by the Taino. Among the cultural signs that they left were cave paintings around the country, which have become touristic and nationalistic symbols of the Dominican Republic, and words from their language, including &quot;hurricane&quot; (hurrakan) and &quot;tobacco&quot; (tabakko).

===The arrival of the Guamikena (the covered ones)===
On December 5, [[1492]], the Europeans arrived. Believing that these beings from over the horizon were in someway supernatural, the Taínos welcomed the Europeans with all the honors available to them. This was a totally different society from the one the Europeans came from.  One of the things that piqued the curiosity was the amount of clothing worn by the Europeans. Therefore they came to call them &quot;guamikena&quot; (the covered ones). [[Guacanagarix]], the chief who hosted [[Christopher Columbus]] and his men, treated them kindly and provided him with everything they desired. Yet the Taínos' allegedly &quot;egalitarian&quot; system clashed with the Europeans' feudalist system, with more rigid class structures. This led the Europeans to believe the Taínos to be either weak or misleading, and they began to treat the tribes with more violence. Columbus tried to temper this when he and his men departed from Quisqueya and they left on a good note. Columbus had cemented a firm alliance with Guacanagarix, who was a powerful chief on the island. After the shipwrecking of the Santa Maria, he decided to establish a small fort with a garrison of men that could help him lay claim to this possession. The fort was called La Navidad, since the events of the shipwrecking and the founding of the fort occurred on Christmas day. The garrison, in spite of all the wealth and beauty on the island, was wracked by divisions within and the men took sides, that evolved  into conflict amongst these first Europeans. The more rapacious ones began to terrorize the Taíno, Ciguayo and Macorix tribesmen up to the point of trying to take their women.

Viewed as weak by the Spaniards and even some of his own people, Guacanagarix tried to come to an accommodation with the Spaniards, who saw his appeasement as the actions of someone who submitted, they treated him with contempt and even took some of his wives too.  The powerful cacique of the maguana, Caonabo could brook no further affronts, attacked the Europeans and destroyed La Navidad. Guacanagarix, dismayed as he was by this turn of events did not try too hard to aid these guamikena, probably hoped that the troublesome outsiders would never return. However, they did return.

===The twentieth century=== 
The twentieth century was marked by repeated U.S. intervention in local affairs. The reason for this was the island's strategic location in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. During the World Wars the islands of the Caribbean were used as stop-off points for German [[U-boats]] from which to plan possible attacks against the North American continent. During the [[Cold War]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and capitalist ideologies clashed openly on the island. Apart from tentative U.S. support for the [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo|Trujillo]] dictatorship (1930-1961) (though this faded during his final years), the largest example of this was the [[1965]] invasion by American troops in the midst of a Dominican civil war, an uprising that was sparked by an attempt to restore the republic's first democratically-elected president of the 20th century, [[Juan Bosch]], who had been overthrown by a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[coup]] in 1963. Following this civil war, and America's deployment of troops in [[Operation Power Pack]], [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (1966-1978) was democractically elected, winning by 57%. Juan Bosch's constitutional government never returned to power. The [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson administration]] justified the 1965 intervention by stating that it suspected many of Bosch's supporters were pro-[[Cuba|Cuban]] [[communism|Communists]].

==Politics== 
:''Main article: [[Politics of the Dominican Republic]]''

The Dominican Republic is a [[representative democracy]] whose national powers are divided among independent [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches. The [[President of the Dominican Republic|president]] appoints the cabinet, executes laws passed by the legislative branch, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president and vice president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for four-year terms.

Legislative power is exercised by a bicameral [[National Congress of the Dominican Republic|National Congress]] — the [[Senate of the Dominican Republic|Senate]] (32 members), and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (150 members). Presidential elections are held in years evenly divisible by four. Congressional and municipal elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four.

==Provinces==
:''Main article: [[Provinces of the Dominican Republic]]''

==Geography==
[[Image:Isla_Saona.jpg|thumb|400px|A beach on the Saona island]]
:''Main article: [[Geography of the Dominican Republic]]''
The capital of the country is the city of [[Santo Domingo ]]-full name Santo Domingo de Guzman, located in the south part of the island. Originally a single city located within the province Distrito Nacional (National District), it has now been divided into a Province of Santo Domingo and the National District. The Province of Santo Domingo is comprised of several municipalities: Santo Domingo Norte (North Santo Domingo), Santo Domingo Este (East Santo Domingo, which is the provincial capital), Santo Domingo Oeste (West Santo Domingo) and Boca Chica. The Ozama River serves a natural border between the National District and the Province of Santo Domingo. Thus the capital city of the Country is the City of Santo Domingo de Guzman, Province of National District. The second largest city is [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], more commonly referred to as simply Santiago.

[[Image:IMG_1281.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of Juan Pablo Duarte in front of La Pelona]]

The country has three major mountain ranges: The Central Mountains (Cordillera Central), which originate in Haiti and span the central part of the island, ending up in the south. This mountain range boasts the highest peak in the [[Antilles]], [[Pico Duarte]] (3 087 m above [[sea level]]). The Septentrional Mountains, running parallel to the Central Mountains, separate the Cibao Valley and the Atlantic coastal plains. The highest point here is Pico Diego de Ocampo. The lowest and shortest of the three ranges is the Eastern Mountains, in the eastern part of the country. There are also the Sierra Bahoruco and the Sierra Neyba in the southwest. This is a country of many rivers, including the navigable Soco, Higuamo, Romana, Yaque del Norte, Yaque del Sur, Yuna, Yuma, and Bajajabonicoco.

==Demographics==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of the Dominican Republic]]''
The majority of Dominicans are of Mixed African, European and Native American (Taino) Blood. A small presence of [[Asian|Asian]], mostly of [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]] descent, and [[Middle East|Middle Easterners]], mostly [[Lebanese]], can be found. Dominican culture is essentially Latin coated with a elements of [[Spanish]]'s culture, like language and religion. African culture also is a major factor, with elements such as the music and Carnival testimony to the rich slave heritage.  It also has many Antilliean, European, and American influences.

Since the early [[1960s]], economic problems have led to a vast migration of Dominicans to the U.S., mainly to large east coast cities, and coming on the heels of a similar migration of [[Puerto Ricans]]. [[New York City]]'s [[Washington Heights]] is so densely populated by Dominicans, it is sometimes referred to as '' Quisqueya Heights''. ''Quisqueya'' is a popular name for Hispaniola that many believe derives from the island's original Arawak name, although this is disputed by some historians. Dominicans are now one of the largest [[Latino]] groups in the US; less numerous than the Mexican majority and Puerto Ricans, and about even with Cubans. There are also sizeable Dominican emigre communities in the [[Netherlands]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Spain]], and [[St. Maarten]].

Dominican Republic has a history of race and prejudice issues, mostly of [[blacks]] against [[blacks]]. This phenomenon is common in the island and much more pronounced in Haiti. In recent years, illegal immigration from Haiti has dramatically increased as the Dominican economy improves and the Haitian economy remains virtually moribund. Most Haitian immigrants work at low-paying, unskilled labor jobs, including construction work and household cleaning. The Dominican sentiment towards these immigrants is frequently negative, and at times in its history, including the period during and after Haiti merged the two nations (the [[19th century]] and the reign of [[Rafael Leonidas Trujillo]]), there have been anti-Haitian pogroms, slaughtering 18,000 Haitians at the border [http://haitiforever.com/windowsonhaiti/warwh.shtml]. This also led to Dominican Republic paying Haiti $750,000 to avert war.  [http://www.thediamondangle.com/marasco/negleg/trujillo.html] Many foreigners reside in the country for business, religious, and leisure reasons, and there are significant populations of Americans, Canadians, Germans, French, and Koreans in the country.

==Economy==
:''Main article: [[Economy of the Dominican Republic]]''
The Dominican Republic is a middle-income developing country primarily dependent on [[agriculture]], [[trade]], and [[services]], especially [[tourism]]. Although the service sector has recently overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and [[Free Trade Zones]]), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place (behind [[mining]]) in terms of [[export]] earnings. Tourism accounts for more than $3 billion in annual earnings. [[Free Trade Zone]] earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. [[Remittances from overseas|Remittances]] from Dominicans living abroad are estimated to be about $3 billion per year.

Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the [[GDP]] fell by up to 5% and consumer price [[inflation]] reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of moderate growth and declining inflation until 2002 after which the economy entered a [[recession]], after the second [[commercial bank]] of the country collapsed, caused by a major [[fraud]]. GDP dropped by 1% in 2003 while inflation ballooned by over 27%.

Despite a widening merchandise [[trade deficit]], tourism earnings and remittances have helped build [[foreign exchange reserves]]. The Dominican Republic is current on foreign [[Consumer debt|private debt]], and has agreed to pay arrears of about $130 million to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture's]] [[Commodity Credit Corporation]].

==Peso==
:''Main article: [[Dominican Peso]]''
The [[Dominican Peso]] (RD$) is the national currency of the country although the [[US dollar]] is often acceptable in some places, especially tourist oriented shops and hotels. At the beginning the peso was worth about the same as a [[US dollar]]. In [[1993]] the US dollar was worth about RD$14.00, in [[1998]] RD$16.00, in [[2002]] RD$20.00, but in [[2003]] almost RD$55.00, [[2004]] RD$37.00, [[2005]] RD$29.90. The US dollar currently fluctuates on a daily basis, and is usually worth between $-31.90-35.00 pesos.  
==Culture==
:''Main article: [[Culture of the Dominican Republic]]''
[[Baseball]] is the top national sport in the Dominican Republic and there are many popular Dominicans who play [[Major League Baseball]] in the U.S., including [[Albert Pujols]], [[Sammy Sosa]],[[Rafael Furcal]], [[Pedro Martinez]], [[David Ortiz]], [[Miguel Tejada]], and [[Manny Ramirez]].  The Dominican Republic also has its own baseball league, which many MLB players go to during off-season, and which is also a &quot;training ground&quot; for the MLB.

Eighty-nine percent of Dominicans are baptized in the [[Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic|Roman Catholic Church]].  Other substantial religious groups are the Evangelical Christians and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Around one percent of the nation's inhabitants practice pure spiritism, although it is very common for Catholicism and spiritism to be mixed in Santeria's seancees and &quot;saint&quot; parties.

The Dominican Republic is known for a form of music called [[merengue (music)|Merengue]], which has been popular since the mid- to late-[[1900s]]. It has sexually charged syncopated beats using Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass and electric guitars. What was considered unpopular to the youth, until today, is a form of folk music called [[Bachata]]. Bachata is usually slow, romantic, and [[Spanish guitar]] driven. However, bachata's rhythm can be sped up to the same [[syncopation]] as Merengue, and its called ''bacharengue''. Both genres of music are popular throughout the world. [[Reggaeton]], a style of music that orginated in Panama, Jamaica, [[Reggae]] and Puerto Rico, is the dominant music of the country's youth, and defines the party lifestyle of the country. The most successful producers of Reggaeton music are [[Luny Tunes]] from [[La Romana]] in the Dominican Republic; Luny Tunes has produced many successfull songs of [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Tego Calderón]], [[Ivy Queen]] and [[Don Omar]]. Reggaeton is a mix of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[bomba]], and [[plena]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the German Institute for Standardization, for other uses of &quot;DIN&quot;, see [[DIN (disambiguation)]]''
'''Deutsches Institut für Normung e.V.''' (DIN, the German Institute for Standardization) is a German national organization for [[standardization]].  

[[DIN plug|DIN and mini-DIN connectors]] are familiar to computer users all over the world, but DIN issues standards in any conceivable area. One of the oldest and surely most popular is [[DIN 476]], specifying paper sizes since [[1922]]. It became an international norm.

DIN is a registered association (''e.V.''), founded in [[1917]], originally as '''Normenausschuss der deutschen Industrie''' (NADI, standardisation committee of the German industry). In [[1926]] the NADI was renamed to '''Deutscher Normenausschuss''' (DNA, German standardisation committee), in [[1975]] the DNA was finally renamed to DIN. Its headquarters is in [[Berlin]]. Since [[1975]] it has been recognized by the German government as the national standards body and represents [[Germany|German]] interests at international and [[Europe|European]] level.

The [[acronym]] DIN is often wrongly expanded as ''Deutsche Industrienorm'' (German industry standard). This is largely due to the historic origin of the DIN as the NADI. The NADI indeed published their standards as ''DI-Norm'' (''Deutsche Industrienorm'', German industry standard). E.g. the first published standard in 1917 was 'DI-Norm 1' (about [[taper pin]]s). Many people still wrongly associate DIN as an abbreviation for the old ''DI-Norm'' naming of standards.

==DIN standard designation==
The designation of a DIN standard shows its origin (# denotes a number):
* ''DIN #'' is used for German standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. ''E DIN #'' is a draft standard and ''DIN V #'' is a preliminary standard.
*''DIN EN #'' is used for German edition of European standards. ''DIN ETS #'' is used for standards prepared by [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]].
*''DIN ISO #'' is used for German edition of ISO standards. ''DIN EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.

==Example of DIN standards==
See the [[List of DIN standards|list of DIN standards]] for
a complete list.

*[[DIN 476]]: international paper sizes (now [[ISO 216]] or DIN EN ISO 216)
*[[DIN 72552]]: electric terminal numbers in [[automobile]]s
*[[DIN 31635]]: transliteration of the Arabic language.

[[Image:15thcenturyhispaniola.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Early map of Hispaniola]]
==Early History to 1599==
The [[island]] of [[Hispaniola]], of which the [[Dominican Republic]] forms the eastern two-thirds and [[Haiti]] the remainder, was originally occupied by [[Taíno]]s, an [[Arawak]]-speaking people who called the island ''Quisqueya'' (or ''Kiskeya''). The Taínos welcomed [[Christopher Columbus]] when he first arrived on December 5, [[1492]] and on his second voyage in 1493 when he founded the first Spanish colony in the New World.
Repression and diseases reduced the Taíno population from about 1 million to about 500 in 50 years. To ensure adequate labor for plantations, the Spanish brought African [[slaves]] to the island beginning in [[1503]]. 

==1600-1929==
In the next century, French settlers occupied the western end of the island, which [[Spain]] ceded to [[France]] in [[1697]], and which, in [[1804]], became the Republic of Haiti. The French held on in the eastern part of the island, until defeated by the Spanish inhabitants at the battle of [[Palo Hincado]] on [[November 7]], [[1808]] and the final capitulation of the besieged Santo Domingo on [[July 9]], [[1809]], with help from the [[Royal Navy]]. The Spanish authorities showed little interest in their restored colony, and the following period is recalled as ''La España Boba'' &amp;#8211; 'The Era of Foolish Spain'. In [[1821]] the Spanish settlers declared an independent state, but Haitian forces occupied the whole island just 9 weeks later and held it for 22 years.  
[[Image:Juan_pablo_duarte.jpg.jpg|frame|right|Juan Pablo Duarte y Diez]]

On [[February 27]], [[1844]], independence was declared from the Haitians. This was the culmination of a movement led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], then in exile, the hero of Dominican independence. The military  forces that drove the occupiers out were led by [[Pedro Santana]].  

The Dominican Republic's first constitution was adopted on [[November 6]], 1844. It adopted a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by [[Pedro Santana]] on the constitutional assembly by force, which gave him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war, but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. 

In [[1861]], during one of his presidencies, Santana restored the Dominican Republic to Spain. This move was widely rejected and on [[August 16]], [[1863]], a national war of &quot;restoration&quot; began. In [[1865]], independence was restored. Economic difficulties, the threat of European intervention, and ongoing internal disorders led to a U.S. occupation in [[1916]] and the establishment of a military government in the Dominican Republic. The occupation ended in [[1924]], with a democratically elected Dominican government. 

==1930 to 1980==
In [[1930]], [[Rafael Trujillo]], a prominent army commander, established absolute political control. Trujillo promoted economic development--from which mainly he and his supporters benefitted--and severe repression of domestic human rights. Mismanagement and corruption resulted in major economic problems.During the European [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Dominican Republic took in many Jews fleeing Hitler. In August [[1960]], the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President [[Rómulo Betancourt]] of [[Venezuela]]. These sanctions remained in force after Trujillo's assassination in May [[1961]]. In November 1961, the Trujillo family was forced into exile, fleeing to France. 

In January [[1962]], a council of state with legislative and executive powers was formed; it included moderate members of the opposition. OAS sanctions were lifted January 4, and, after the resignation of President [[Joaquín Balaguer]] on January 16, the council under President [[Rafael Bonnelly]] headed the Dominican government. In [[1963]], [[Juan Bosch]] was inaugurated President. Bosch was overthrown in a military coup in September 1963.  

After Bosch's overthrow a &quot;Triumvirate&quot; established a de facto dictatorship until April 24 [[1965]], when another military coup led to violence between military elements favoring the return to government by Bosch and those who proposed a military junta committed to early general elections. On April 28, after being requested by the anti Bosch army elements, U.S. military forces landed, officially to protect U.S. citizens and to evacuate U.S. and other foreign nationals. Additional U.S. forces subsequently established order. 

In June [[1966]], President Balaguer, leader of the Reformist Party (now called the [[Social Christian Reformist Party]]--PRSC), was elected and then re-elected to office in May [[1970]] and May [[1974]], both times after the major opposition parties withdrew late in the campaign because of the high degree of violence by pro government groups. In the May [[1978]] election, Balaguer was defeated in his bid for a fourth successive term by [[Antonio Guzmán]] of the PRD. Guzmán's inauguration on August 16 marked the country's first peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to another. 

==1980 - Present==
The PRD's presidential candidate, [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]], won the [[1982]] elections, and the PRD gained a majority in both houses of Congress. In an attempt to cure the ailing economy, the Jorge administration began to implement economic adjustment and recovery policies, including an austerity program in cooperation with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). In April [[1984]], rising prices of basic foodstuffs and uncertainty about austerity measures led to riots. 

Balaguer was returned to the presidency with electoral victories in [[1986]] and [[1990]]. Upon taking office in 1986, Balaguer tried to reactivate the economy through a public works construction program. Nonetheless, by [[1988]], the country slid into a 2-year economic depression, characterized by high inflation and currency devaluation. Economic difficulties, coupled with problems in the delivery of basic services--including electricity, water, and transportation--generated popular discontent that resulted in frequent protests, occasionally violent, including a paralyzing nationwide strike in June [[1989]]. 

In 1990, Balaguer instituted a second set of economic reforms. After concluding an IMF agreement, balancing the budget, and curtailing inflation, the Dominican Republic is experiencing a period of economic growth marked by moderate inflation, a balance in external accounts, and a steadily increasing GDP. 
[[Image:Leonel Fernández Reyna.jpg|frame|Leonel Fernández Reyna]]
The voting process in 1986 and 1990 was generally seen as fair, but allegations of electoral board fraud tainted both victories. The elections of [[1994]] were again marred by charges of fraud. Following a compromise calling for constitutional and electoral reform, President Balaguer assumed office for an abbreviated term. In June [[1996]], [[Leonel Fernández Reyna]] was elected to a 4-year term as president. In May [[2000]] [[Hipólito Mejía]] was elected to a 4-year term as president. In May [[2004]], [[Leonel Fernández Reyna]] was again elected to a 4-year term as president and inaugurated as such on August 16th, [[2004]].
The Dominican Republic was involved in the US led coalition in Iraq, but in ''[[2004]]'', the nation pulled its troops out of Iraq.

On Apr 27, 2005, education secretary, Alejandrina German, announced the republic's new plan to institute mandatory English classes beginning in September.  In addition, one school from each district will be selected to participate in a pilot program for bilingual education. The program involves teaching mathematics, sciences, the arts, and physical education in English in the first nine grades.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of the Dominican Republic}}
The [[Dominican Republic]] is a [[representative democracy]] whose national powers are divided among independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president appoints the cabinet, executes laws passed by the legislative branch, and is commander in chief of the armed forces. The president and vice president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for four-year terms.

[[Legislature|Legislative power]] is exercised by a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Congress of the Dominican Republic|National Congress]] -- the [[Senate of the Dominican Republic|Senate]] (32 members), and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (150 members). Presidential elections are held in years evenly divisible by four. Congressional and municipal elections are held in even numbered years not divisible by four.

Under the constitutional reforms negotiated after the 1994 elections, the 16-member Supreme Court of Justice is appointed by a National Judicial Council, which is nominated by the three major political parties. The Court has sole jurisdiction over actions against the president, designated members of his cabinet, and members of Congress.

The Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts and chooses members of lower courts. Each of the 29 provinces is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Elected mayors and municipal councils administer the National District (Santo Domingo) and the 103 municipal districts.

==Recent political history==

The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system with national elections every four years. In two rounds of presidential elections in 1996, nearly 80% of eligible Dominican voters went to the polls. The leading parties in 1994 were the PRSC, linked to the International [[Christian Democratic]] political movement, whose candidate was President [[Joaquín Balaguer]]; the PRD, affiliated with the Socialist International, whose candidate was [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]]; and the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), whose candidate was former President [[Juan Bosch]].

In the 1994 elections, international observers noted many irregularities in the voter lists, and the opposition PRD immediately charged the Central Electoral Board and the PRSC with fraud. A Verification Commission appointed by the Central Electoral Board, however, did not accept the PRD's charges. By all estimates, total disenfranchised voters far exceeded the 22,281-vote margin of victory in favor of President Balaguer on [[2 August]] [[1994]].

Following an intense period of political activity, the competing political parties signed a Pact for Democracy on [[10 August]], reducing President Balaguer's term of office from 4 to 2 years, setting early elections, and reforming the constitution. A new Central Electoral Board was named to work on electoral reform. The main candidates in 1996 were Vice President [[Jacinto Peynado]] (PRSC), José Francisco Peña Gómez (PRD), and [[Leonel Fernández]] (PLD).

Domestic and international observers saw the 1996 election as transparent and fair. After the first round in which Jacinto Peynado (PRSC) was eliminated, the PRSC with Joaquín Balaguer endorsed Leonel Fernandez (PLD). Results in the second round, 45 days later on [[30 June]], were tabulated quickly, and although the victory margin was narrow (1.5%), it was never questioned. The transition from incumbent administration to incoming administration was smooth and ushered in a new, modern era in Dominican political life.

Fernández' political agenda was one of economic and judicial reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric affairs, such as the Organization of American States and the follow up to the Miami Summit. On [[16 May]] [[2000]], [[Hipólito Mejía]], the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate, was elected president in another free and fair election. He defeated Dominican Liberation Party candidate [[Danilo Medina]] 49.8% to 24.84%. Former President Balaguer garnered 24.68% of the vote. Mejia entered office on [[16 August]] with four priorities: education reform, economic development, increased agricultural production, and poverty alleviation. Mejia also champions the cause of Central American and Caribbean economic integration and migration, particularly as it relates to Haiti.

The military consists of about 24,000 active duty personnel, commanded by the president. Its principal mission is to defend the nation, but it serves more as an internal security force. The army, twice as large as the other services combined, consists of four infantry brigades and a combat support brigade; the air force operates three flying squadrons; and the navy maintains 30 aging vessels. The Dominican Republic's military is second in size to Cuba's in the Caribbean.

The armed forces participate fully in counter-narcotics efforts. They also are active in efforts to control contraband and illegal immigration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Dominican Republic]] is a middle-income [[developing country]] primarily dependent on [[agriculture]], trade, and services, especially [[tourism]]. Although the service sector has recently overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and Free Trade Zones), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place (behind mining) in terms of export earnings. Tourism accounts for more than $1 billion in annual earnings. Free Trade Zone earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. [[Remittance]]s from Dominicans living in the [[United States]], are estimated to be about $1.5 billion per year.

==Overview==
Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the GDP fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of moderate growth and declining inflation until 2002 after which the economy entered a recession, after the second commercial bank of the country collapsed, caused by a major fraud.  GDP dropped by 1% in 2003 while inflation balooned by over 27%.

Despite a widening merchandise trade deficit, tourism earnings and remittances have helped build foreign exchange reserves. The Dominican Republic is current on foreign private debt, and has agreed to pay arrears of about $130 million to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation.

The government faces several economic policy challenges--high real interest rates, fiscal imbalances caused by money-losing public enterprises and poor tax-collection rates, and reducing dependence on taxes on international trade. Years of tariff protection for domestic production have left the economy vulnerable in a rapidly integrating global economy. The deteriorating non-free trade zone merchandise trade balance is in part due to the failure of the exchange rate to reflect inflationary trends in the 1993-1995 period.

In December 1996, incoming President Fernandez presented a bold reform package for this Caribbean economy - including the devaluation of the peso, income tax cuts, a 50% increase in sales taxes, reduced import tariffs, and increased gasoline prices - in an attempt to create a market-oriented economy that can compete internationally. Even though most reforms are stalled in the legislature - including the intellectual property rights bill, social security reform, and a new electricity law first submitted in 1993 - the economy has grown vigorously under Fernandez's administration. Construction, tourism and telecommunications are leading the advance. The government is working to increase electric generating capacity, a key to continued economic growth; the state electricity company was finally privatized following numerous delays. The continuation of this vigorous growth in 2000 will depend on the policies adopted by the new administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Dominican Republic]] has a close relationship with the [[United States]] and with the other states of the Inter-American system. It has accredited diplomatic missions in most [[Western Hemisphere]] countries and in principal [[Europe]]an capitals. The Dominican Republic maintains official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as “Taiwan”) instead of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Dominican Republic and [[Cuba]] recently established consular relations, and there is contact in fields such as commerce, culture, and sports. Although Dominican relations with its closest neighbor, the Republic of [[Haiti]], have never been extensive, there are signs this would have changed with the  government of President Mejia. Growing immigration from and political instability in Haiti have forced the Dominican Republic to take a closer look at relations with its neighbor both country-to-country and in international fora. There is a sizeable Haitian migrant community in the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic belongs to the [[United Nations]] and many of its specialized and related agencies, including the [[World Bank]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]. It also is a member of the [[OAS]], World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, World Customs Organization the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], and ACP Group.

The Dominican Republic has very strong ties and relations with [[Puerto Rico]]. Although a [[United States]] Commonwealth, the island is the Dominican Republic's largest trading partner.  While relations between both islands have had difficulties, mainly due the huge exodus of illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic due to the nation's history of economic woes, the islands still, with the assistance of the United States Coast Guard and the Dominican navy have worked hard to reduce the number of Dominicans crossing the [[Mona Passage]] in recent years. Puerto Rico is home to an estimated 500,000 Dominicans, and the Dominican Republic maintains consulates in the cities of [[San_Juan_Puerto_Rico|San Juan]] and [[Mayagüez_Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''disease''' is any abnormal condition of the [[human body|body]] or [[mind]] that causes [[discomfort]], [[dysfunction]], or distress to the person afflicted or those in contact with the person. Sometimes the term is used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, [[syndrome]]s, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts these may be considered distinguishable categories.

[[Pathology]] is the study of diseases.  The subject of systematic classification of diseases is referred to as [[nosology]]. The broader body of knowledge about human diseases and their treatments is [[medicine]]. Many similar (and a few of the same) conditions or processes can affect animals (wild or domestic). The study of diseases affecting animals is [[veterinary medicine]]. Plants as well can suffer from a variety of processes such as infection, nutrient deficiency, or deleterious mutation. The study of diseases affecting plants is termed [[plant pathology]]. 

==Syndromes, illness and disease==

Medical usage sometimes distinguishes a ''disease'', which has a known specific cause or causes (called its [[etiology]]), from a ''syndrome'', which is a collection of signs or [[symptom]]s that occur together. However, many conditions have been identified, yet continue to be referred to as &quot;syndromes&quot;. Furthermore, numerous conditions of unknown etiology are referred to as &quot;diseases&quot; in many contexts.

[[Illness]], although often used to mean disease, can also refer to a person's ''perception'' of their health, regardless of whether they in fact have a disease.  A person without any disease may feel unhealthy and believe he has an illness.  Another person may feel healthy and believe he does not have an illness even though he may have a disease such as dangerously [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]] which may lead to a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]].

==Transmission of disease==
Some diseases, such as [[influenza]], are contagious or [[infection|infectious]], and can be transmitted by any of a variety of mechanisms, including droplets from coughs and sneezes, by bites of insects or other [[vector (biology)|vectors]], from contaminated water or food, etc.	

Other diseases, such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]] are not considered to be due to infection, although micro-organisms may play a role.

==Social significance of disease==
The identification of a condition as a disease, rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function, can have significant social or economic implications. The controversial recognitions as diseases of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], also known as &quot;shell shock&quot;; [[repetitive motion injury]] or [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI); and [[Gulf War syndrome]] has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing [[senescence|aging]] as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.

A condition may be considered to be a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others. [[Oppositional-defiant disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], and, increasingly, [[obesity]] are conditions considered to be diseases in the United States and Canada today, but were not so-considered decades ago and are not so-considered in some other countries. [[Leprosy|Lepers]] were a group of afflicted individuals who were historically shunned and the term &quot;leper&quot; still evokes social stigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomena, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.

a disease can also be caused by repeated high anger or stress.

==Other uses of the term==

In [[biology]], ''disease'' refers to any abnormal condition of an organism that impairs function.

The term ''disease'' is often used metaphorically for disordered, dysfunctional, or distressing conditions of other things, as in ''disease of society''.

The '''Dardanelles''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Çanakkale Boğazı,'' [[Greek Language|Greek]]: ''Δαρδανελλια''), formerly known as the [[Hellespont]], is a narrow [[strait]] in northwestern [[Turkey]] connecting the [[Aegean Sea]] with the [[Sea of Marmara]]. It is located at approximately {{coor dm|40|13|N|26|26|E|}}. The strait is 61 km (38 miles) long but only 1.2 to 6 km (0.75 to 4 miles) wide, averaging 55 m (180 ft) deep with a maximum depth of 82 m (300 ft). Water flows in both directions along the strait, from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean via a surface current and in the opposite direction via an undercurrent.

Just like the [[Bosporus]] strait, it separates [[Europe]] (in this case the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula) and the mainland of [[Asia]]. The strait is an [[International waterway]] and together with the Bosporus connect the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The major city adjoining the strait is [[Çanakkale]] (which takes its name from its famous [[castle]]s; ''kale'' means &quot;castle&quot;). The name ''Dardanelles'' derives from [[Dardanus]], an [[ancient Greek]] city on the Asian shore of the strait.

==History==
The strait has long had a strategic role in history. The ancient city of [[Troy]] was located near the western entrance of the strait and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the [[Trojan War]]. It was also the scene of the legendary Greek story of [[Hero and Leander]]. The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes I]] and later the [[Macedon]]ian army of [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in [[480 BC]] and [[334 BC]] respectively. The Dardanelles were vital to the defence of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, and since the [[14th century]] they have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.

Gaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the [[Russian Empire]] during the [[19th century]]. Following the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829]], in [[1833]] Russia forced the Turks to sign the Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi which required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. This would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea. 

The treaty alarmed the Western powers, who feared the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Mediterranean. At the London Straits Convention in July [[1841]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] forced Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack the [[Crimea]] during the [[Crimean War]] in [[1853]], though this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire. This convention was formally reaffirmed by the [[Congress of Paris]] in [[1856]], following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, and it remained theoretically in force into the [[20th century]].

The Allies made a failed attempt to seize the Dardanelles during [[World War I]], seeking to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the conflict. The [[Dardanelles Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] damaged the career of [[Winston Churchill]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] who eagerly promoted the use of [[Royal Navy]] [[battleship|battleships]] to force open the straits. The straits were mined to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, although a British submarine did succeed in evading the minefields and sank a Turkish battleship off the [[Golden Horn]] in Istanbul.  [[Sir Ian Hamilton]]'s [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and a withdrawal was ordered in January [[1916]].

Following the war, the [[1920]] [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. This was amended under the [[1923]] [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which restored the straits to Turkey but allowed all foreign warships to traverse the straits freely. Turkey rejected the terms of this treaty and subsequently remilitarized the area. The reversion to this old regime was formalised under the [[Montreux Convention]] of July [[1936]]. The convention, which is still in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-[[Black Sea]] nations (like [[Greece]]). During [[World War II]], when Turkey was neutral for almost the entire length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations.

The '''Western Dvina''' or '''Daugava''' ({{lang-be|Заходняя Дзьвіна (Zahodniaja Dźvina)}}, {{lang-lv|Daugava}}, {{lang-ru|Западная Двина́}}, {{lang-pl|Dźwina}}, {{lang-de|Düna}}, {{lang-et|Väina}}) is a [[river]] rising in the [[Valdai Hills]], [[Russia]], flowing through Russia, [[Belarus]], and  [[Latvia]], draining into the [[Gulf of Riga]], an arm of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The total length of the river is 1,020 km (633.7 mi.).

It is connected by a canal with [[Berezina]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers.

It is not to be confused with [[Northern Dvina]].

There are three [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[dam]]s on the river - [[Rīgas HES]] just upstream from [[Riga]] or 35 km from the mouth of the river, [[Ķeguma HES]] another 35 km further up or 70 km from the mouth, and [[Pļaviņu HES]] another 37 km upstream or 107 km from the mouth. A fourth one, [[Daugavpils HES]], has been planned but has always faced strong criticism. [[Belarus]] currently plans to build several hydroelectric dams on the Belarusian part of Daugava.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Douglas Coupland''' (born [[December 30]], [[1961]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[fiction]] writer, artist and cultural commentator. He is perhaps best known for the [[1991]] [[novel]] ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]],'' which popularized the term &quot;[[Generation X]].&quot; Most of Coupland's work explores the harsher realities of life for this generation, including intense media saturation, a lack of religious values and economic instability.

==Biography==
Coupland was born to Dr. Douglas Charles Thomas and C. Janet Coupland on a Canadian [[NATO]] [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] base in Baden Söllingen, [[Germany]]. Douglas was the third child in his family; the rest of his siblings were all male. His family moved back to Canada four years later, where he was raised and still lives.

Coupland left Vancouver as a teenager to study [[physics]] at [[McGill|McGill University]]. There he stayed only 2 years before going back to Vancouver to study art at [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design|Emily Carr]]. Trained as a sculptor, Coupland graduated and began travelling. He worked in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] before returning to his hometown, where he began to write on youth and popular culture for local magazines.  This led him to the subject of his breakthrough novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'' ([[1991]]), which was critically praised for capturing the [[zeitgeist]] of his peer group, for whom its title provided a convenient label. Although society later guestimated &quot;[[Generation X|generation x]]&quot;, the generation, as being born up to and including the early [[1970s]], Douglas' range was close enough to approximate the label. Without knowing it, he had literally provided one of the names for his whole generation. Consequently, Coupland starred in a series of [[MTV]] promos, reading excerpts from his book, participating in a form of mutual validation.

His next novel, ''[[Shampoo Planet]]'', had a more conventional structure than its predecessor but many similarities, including a detailed eye for the mores and minutiae of the lives of its young protagonists, including [[video games]], hippie parents and an obsession with grooming products.  ''[[Microserfs]]'' ([[1995]]) is centred on high-tech life in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]], and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]], contrasting the corporate culture of [[Microsoft]] with pre-[[dot-com bubble]] start-up companies.

''[[Girlfriend in a Coma (book)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]'' (with a title from, and many knowing nods within the text to, [[The Smiths]]) showed a willingness to tackle broader themes and featured some of his most mature writing &amp;mdash; poet and critic [[Tom Paulin]] described his use of language as &quot;fresh, like wet paint&quot;.  Like the earlier novels, however, it was criticised as poorly structured.  

With its adoption of [[supernatural]] elements, ''Girlfriend in a Coma'' also marked a change in Coupland's work.  Hitherto, his narratives were focused on conventional characters living in a carefully drawn but instantly recognisable modern world.  The plots of ''Girlfriend in a Coma'' and his subsequent novels have all introduced either supernatural occurrences or involve what can only be described as &quot;low probability events&quot; (e.g. air disasters, meteorite impacts).  This change has moved Coupland away from his earlier generation-defining work, but has allowed him to develop and explore new themes.

While his books are rich in humour, observation and carefully drawn vignettes, Coupland's critics noted a tendency for the plot development to be lost amongst these.  The apocalyptic ending of ''Girlfriend...'', which seems forced and out of step with the remainder, is often held up as a case in point.  In this context, ''Miss Wyoming'' is possibly his most rounded and satisfying novel.

[[Sofia Coppola]]'s company acquired the film rights to ''Generation X'' in 2001, although the one-year option on the property has long expired, leaving this and many other Coupland film projects in limbo.{{ref|gill}} As of [[2005]], many of the film projects are still awaiting crystalization.  Coupland mentioned in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Advocate]]'' that the adaptation of his ''All Families Are [[Psychotic]]'' by [[Dreamworks Pictures]] appears to have the most chance of becoming a film.  In the same interview he also [[coming out|came out]] as [[homosexuality|gay]] to the general public.{{ref|duralde}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[film]], '''&quot;daily rushes&quot;''' (or simply &quot;rushes&quot; or &quot;dailies&quot;) is the footage shot during a given day, without external soundtrack or adjustment. &quot;Rush&quot; in this context means &quot;rush print&quot;, a film print made with greater than usual urgency to meet the deadline for viewing the day's work in progress.  

The rushes for a given day may consist of, for instance, footage of a conversation taken from two different cameras, without the [[insert]]s, [[cutaway]]s, or [[closeup]]s that may later be edited in; or they may consist entirely of cutaways, inserts, and establishing shots, without their later context.  Frequently the rushes from a given day will consist of short segments from completely different points in the film, making it more challenging to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].  For instance, the weather may make it impossible to film according to schedule, or a location may be available only for a certain amount of time, making it necessary to film all of the scenes at that place at the same time, regardless of their place within the story.  For this reason rushes are presented without final context and are typically not a good indicator of how the film might turn out.

[[Image:Dynamite.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Dynamite recovered in a mine in Ohio Valley. There is no certainty that all sticks of dynamite placed in a charge will detonate. Sticks that survive are a hazard to miners and workers who process the ore]]'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive]] based on the explosive potential of [[nitroglycerin]] using [[diatomaceous earth]] (Kieselguhr) as an adsorbent. It was invented by [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[1866]] and [[patent|patented]] in [[1867]]. It is usually sold in the form of a stick roughly eight [[inch]]es (20 cm) long and one inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, but other sizes also exist. Dynamite is considered a &quot;high explosive&quot;, which means it [[detonation|detonates]] instead of [[deflagration |deflagrating]]. 

==Uses== 

The chief uses of brexlits used to be in construction, mining, and demolition. During the [[industrial revolution]] there was a large need for such big explosives for use in the mining industry and in tunnel construction. However, newer explosives and techniques have replaced dynamite in many applications. Dynamite is still used, mainly as bottom charge or in underwater blasting.

Dynamite has been used in armed conflicts.

Criminals interested in [[safe-cracking]] have deliberately extracted nitroglycerin from dynamite by boiling the sticks and 'skimming' the nitroglycerin as it is forced out.

==Characteristics==
Dynamite is quite insensitive to impact, friction and shock. It is said that a stick will burn but not explode when placed in a small fire. 
A small explosion will detonate dynamite; a [[blasting cap]] or similar device is used for this effect. Dynamite can also be detonated by soaking it in gasoline, and then burning it. 

In long-term storage, dynamite will 'sweat', meaning the nitroglycerin will pass out of the adsorbent to form drops of pure liquid on the surface of the stick. This causes a serious safety hazard and has led to a decrease of the popularity of dynamite.

Another black mark against dynamite was that it was responsible, over the years, for a number of fatal explosions for which no cause could be found. For example, in the mid-seventies, a pile of sticks of dynamite recovered routinely during the course of the day from the ore conveyor belt at the [[Berg Aukas]] mine in [[Namibia]] exploded without warning or apparent cause and killed several workers. 

==Composition==
Dynamite contains three parts nitroglycerin, one part diatomaceous earth and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]]. This mixture is formed into short sticks and wrapped in paper.

Nitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, but in its pure form it is shock-sensitive (i.e., physical shock can cause it to explode), and it degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes it highly dangerous to transport or use in its pure form. Absorbed into diatomaceous earth, nitroglycerin is not shock-sensitive.

==History==
Dynamite was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than black powder. Nobel patented his discovery in October 1867.

He originally sold dynamite as ''&quot;Nobel's Safety Blasting Powder&quot;''. After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained popularity as a safe alternative to gunpowder and nitroglycerin.  Nobel tightly controlled the patent and unlicensed duplicators were quickly shut down.  However, a few United States businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula. Despite this, dynamite brought Nobel a great fortune, which he used to found the [[Nobel Prize]]. 
For several decades from the 1940's the biggest producer of dynamite in the world was the Republic of South Africa, where [[De Beers]] established a factory in [[1902]] at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] or African Explosives and Chemical Industries. The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centred on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 was already producing 340 000 cases (50lb) annually. In addition, a rival factory at Modderfontein was producting another 200 000 cases a year (http://www.caia.co.za/chsahs02.htm). 
One of the drawbacks of dynamite was that it was dangerous to manufacture. There were two massive explosions at the Somerset West plant in the 1960s. Some workers died but loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and earth works and plantations of trees that directed the blasts upwards. After 1985 production of dynamite at the factory was phased out http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm.

The word ''dynamite'' comes from the Greek word ''&amp;delta;&amp;upsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;alpha;&amp;mu;&amp;iota;&amp;sigmaf;'' (''dunamis''), meaning ''power'', and the Greek suffix ''-&amp;#953;&amp;#964;&amp;#951;&amp;#962;'' (''-it&amp;#275;s'').

'''David Fincher''' (born [[May 10]], [[1962]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[music video director|music video]] and [[film director]] known for his dark and stylish portraits of the human experience.
 
==Early Life and Career==
Born in [[Denver, Colorado]], Fincher was raised in [[Marin County]] [[California]]. He moved to [[Ashland]], [[Oregon]] in his teens where he graduated from high school. 

Inspired by the film, [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]], he began making movies at the age of eight with an 8mm camera. Filmmaking seemed the perfect outlet for a kid who could spend all day drawing and loved to make sculptures, take pictures and tape-record stuff. Fincher eschewed the film school route, getting a job loading cameras and doing other hands-on work for [[John Korty]]'s [[Korty Films]]. He next got a job at [[Industrial Light and Magic]] in 1980 with his first screen credit being for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', and stayed until [[1984]]. He left the company and directed the documentary ''[[The Beat of the Live Drum]]''. Based on its strength he went on to helm TV commercials, shooting his first one for the [[American Cancer Society]], a grim hint of things to come showing a fetus smoking a cigarette. Though he would go on to direct spots for [[Revlon]], [[Converse]], [[Nike]], [[Pepsi]] and [[Levi's]], Fincher soon discovered that the slightly expanded format of music videos was an even better place to try things out.

==Propaganda Films==
With his sights set on a directing career, he along with [[Steve Golin]], [[Sigurjón Sighvatson]] and [[Dominic Sena]] founded the talent management and advertising and video-production company ''[[Propaganda Films]]'' in 1986, which would soon become the biggest player in the field of advertising and music videos. Directors such as  [[David Kellogg]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Antoine Fuqua]], [[Neil LaBute]], [[Spike Jonze]], Andrew Douglas, Stephane Sednaoui, [[Mark Romanek]], Malcolm Venville, [[Michel Gondry]], [[Zack Snyder]], [[Gore Verbinski]], and [[Alex Proyas]] among others honed their talents at ''Propaganda'' before moving on to feature films. The company shut down in 2001 after key members left. The same year, Fincher, Golin, and Kellogg, among others, formed the talent management and advertising and music production company ''Anonymous Content''.

==Music Videos==
Fincher directed big-budget [[music video]]s for artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (including &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;), [[George Michael]], [[Aerosmith]], [[the Rolling Stones]] (including &quot;Love Is Strong&quot;), [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[the Wallflowers]] and [[A Perfect Circle]], as well as [[television commercial|commercial]]s. Like a number of other music video directors, he then moved into film.

==Features==
===''Alien³''===
Fincher's debut was ''[[Alien³]]'' ([[1992]]), which was then the most expensive picture ever made by a first-time director. Unfortunately the film was not a pleasant experience for Fincher, having had a difficult time with the people at [[20th Century Fox]], who built sets without a finished script and made production a nightmare.  While it received an Oscar nomination for special effects, the film was not well received by critics or movie goers.  Depressed and disillusioned, Fincher retreated back into the world of commercial and music video directing earning a [[Grammy]] for the [[Rolling Stones]]'s &quot;Love Is Strong&quot; (1994) fearing that he would never work in film again.

===''Se7en''===
Fate finally came knocking on Fincher's door with [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]'s screenplay for a grisly detective story titled ''[[Seven (movie)|Se7en]]'' (1995). Relentlessly grim and oozing with rancid cynicism, Fincher pulled no punches delivering an extraordinarily gripping, unrelenting story of a serial killer murdering his victims according to the seven deadly sins.  The movie rocketed past the $100 million mark turning Fincher from Hollywood's favorite whipping boy to arguably the town's hottest director. The film's success was even more remarkable for the fact that it strayed so far from the escapist fare that typically primes a film for mainstream commercial standing.

===''The Game''===
Next came the dark adventure film, ''[[The Game (film)|The Game]]'' (1997), a nightmarish, [[Twilight Zone]]-style thriller which projected the same sense of suffocating enclosure and mounting despair as had ''Se7en''. The film boasted almost as much feel-bad cynicism as ''Se7en'', but failed to get the warm reception enjoyed by its predecessor.
  
===''Fight Club''===
The relative disappointment of ''[[The Game (film)|The Game]]'', however, did little to dim the excitement that accompanied Fincher's next project, ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', a screen adaptation of [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel of the [[Fight Club|same name]]. Featuring a sterling cast that included [[Edward Norton]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and ''Se7en'' collaborator [[Brad Pitt]], the 1999 film was easily one of the most publicized of the year but was an early disappointment at the box-office and received with mixed reviews. Fueled in equal measure by stylistic audacity and the spirit of disenfranchised machismo, ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' the film was panned by most critics (called ''Macho porn'' by [[Roger Ebert]]) and alienated audiences leading to its box office failure. 

However many critics and audiences later had a change of heart and the film appeared on many best of the year lists and soon developed an enormous following.  Entertainment Weekly, which had originally given the film a negative grade of D, later ranked the DVD #1 on its list of &quot;The Top 50 DVDs You Need To Own.&quot;  The DVD market, which was experiencing rapid growth at the time, caused Fight Club to not only break even, but actually become profitable.  It now has one of the biggest cult followings in recent memory.

===''Panic Room''===
In 2002 he followed up with the thriller ''[[Panic Room]]'', which introduced some innovative uses of [[computer graphics]]. While a stunning technical achievement with a good gross at the box office, the film was not as well recieved as ''Se7en'', ''Fight Club'' or ''The Game''.

==The Future==
===Zodiac===
''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' is an adaptation of Robert Graysmith's books about the hunt for [[Zodiac killer]], the film stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Mark Ruffalo]].

===Benjamin Button=== 
The fantasy film, ''[[Benjamin Button]]'' is an adaptation of [[F Scott Fitzgerald]]'s short story ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button''. The film will reunite Fincher with [[Brad Pitt]]. 

===Torso===
Fincher is also attached to direct an adaptation of [[Brian Michael Bendis]]' [[graphic novel]] ''[[Torso (film)|Torso]]''.

This is a list of '''decades''' which have articles with more information about them. See also [[centuries]] and [[history]].

During the [[20th Century]] and continuing today it became popular to look at that century's decades as historical entities in themselves. Particular trends, styles, and attitudes would be associated with and define different decades of the century, and thus the names of the decades themselves have come to be synonymous with them. Some commentators suggest that this phenomenon will not continue into the [[21st Century]] with its decades.

'''Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart''' (born [[January 30]], [[1925]] in [[Oregon]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[inventor]] of [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian descent]].  He is best known for inventing the [[computer mouse]] (in a joint effort with [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English]]); as a pioneer of [[human-computer interaction]] whose team developed [[hypertext]], networked computers, and precursors to [[graphical user interface|GUIs]]; and as a committed and vocal proponent of the development and use of [[computers]] and [[computer network|networks]] to help cope with the world's increasingly more urgent and complex problems (which [[Horst W. J. Rittel]] and others since have called [[wicked problems]]).

==Education==
Engelbart received a [[Bachelor's degree]] in electrical engineering from [[Oregon State University]] in 1948, a Bachelor of Engineering degree from UC Berkeley in 1952, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]. from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] in 1955. While at Oregon State, he was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] social fraternity.

As a [[World War II]] naval radio [[technician]] based in the [[Philippines]], Engelbart was inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s article &quot;[[As We May Think]]&quot;. After the war, Engelbart studied at UC Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1955. He spent over a year trying to create an unsuccessful [[startup]], Digital Techniques, to commercialize some of his doctorate research into storage devices, then was hired to work in [http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/allmagnetic-logic.html magnetic logic] devices at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], now headquartered in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], while the organization was still affiliated with [[Stanford University]].

==Career and accomplishments==
[[Image:firstmouseunderside.jpg|frame|The first [[computer mouse]] held by Engelbart showing the wheels which directly contact the working surface.]]

[[Historian]] of science [[Thierry Bardini]] has persuasively argued that Engelbart's complex personal [[philosophy]] (which drove all his research endeavors) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of [[coevolution]] to the philosophy and use of [[technology]]. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the [[principle of linguistic relativity]] developed by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]].  

Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved  technologies.  He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing  computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work. Engelbart's philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly expressed in the 1962 research report which Engelbart refers to as his 'bible':  [http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]. The concept of network augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart based on this pioneering work.

At SRI, Engelbart was the primary force behind the design and development of the [[On-Line System]], or NLS. He and his team at the [[Augmentation Research Center]] (the lab he founded) developed computer-interface elements such as bit-mapped screens, multiple windows, groupware, [[hypertext]] and precursors to the [[graphical user interface]]. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas back in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most individuals were kept away from computers, and could only use computers through intermediaries (see [[batch processing]]), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.  

[[Image:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg|200px|thumb| An [[Apple Macintosh]] Plus's Mouse, 1986]]

In 1970 Engelbart received a [[patent]] for the wooden shell with two metal wheels ([[computer mouse]] {{US patent|3,541,541}}), describing it in the patent application as an ''&quot;X-Y position indicator for a display system&quot;''.  Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the ''mouse'' because the tail came out the end. It was also called the ''bug'' at the time (as evidenced by Engelbart's personal correspondence on file at Stanford) but eventually this practice died out. 

He never received any [[royalties]] for his mouse invention, partly because his patent expired in 1987, before the personal computer revolution made the mouse an indispensable input device, and also because subsequent mice used different mechanisms that did not infringe upon the original patent. During an interview, he says &quot;[[SRI International|SRI]] patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later I learned that they had licensed it to [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for something like $40,000.&quot;

Engelbart showcased many of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at the so-called [[The Mother of All Demos|mother of all demos]].

===ARPANET===
Because Engelbart's research and tool-development for online collaboration and interactive human-computer interfaces was partially funded by [[Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]], SRI's ARC became involved with the, [[ARPANET#Initial_ARPANET_deployment |ARPANET]] (the precursor of the [[Internet]]). 

On [[October 29]], [[1969]], the world's first electronic computer network, the [[ARPANET#Initial_ARPANET_deployment |ARPANET]], was established  between nodes at [[Leonard Kleinrock]]'s lab at [[UCLA]] and Engelbart's lab at SRI. [[Interface Message Processors]] at both sites served as the [[Internet backbone| backbone]] of the first [[Internet]] [http://www.engineer.ucla.edu/stories/2004/Internet35.htm]. 

In addition to SRI and UCLA, [[UCSB]], and the [[University of Utah]] were part of the original four network nodes. By [[December 5]], [[1969]], the entire 4-node network was connected.

ARC soon became the first [[Network Information Center]] and thus managed the directory for connections among all ARPANET nodes. ARC also published a large percentage of the early [[Request For Comment]]s, an ongoing series of publications that document the evolution of ARPANET/Internet.

==End of corporate career and subsequent developments==
Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity after 1976 due to various misfortunes and misunderstandings.  Several of Engelbart's best researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for [[Xerox PARC]], in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing, where Engelbart saw the future in timeshare (client/server) computing, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and social: Engelbart came from a time in which only timeshare computing was achievable, and also believed in joint effort; the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon. The [[Mansfield Amendment]], the end of the [[Vietnam War]], and the end of [[Project Apollo]] reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and [[NASA]]. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of [[artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Bert Raphael]], who fired Engelbart (from the lab that Engelbart had founded) in 1976. Engelbart's house in [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] burned down shortly afterwards, causing him and his family even further problems. 

In 1978, a company called [[Tymshare]] bought [[On-Line System|NLS]], hired its creator as a Senior Scientist, and offered commercial services based upon NLS.  Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; back when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.

At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity--operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to do further research.  Various executives first at Tymshare and later at [[McDonnell Douglas]] (which took over Tymshare in 1982) expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them.  He left McDonnell in 1986 and retired from corporate life.

Since the late 1980s, prominent individuals and organizations have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions:

In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, he was the first recipient of what would later become the [[Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award]]. In 1997 he was awarded the [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] of $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and innovation, and the [[Turing Award]]. In 1998 the [http://svarchive.stanford.edu/ ''Stanford Silicon Valley Archives''] and the [[Institute for the Future]] hosted [http://unrev.stanford.edu/ ''Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution''], a large [[symposium]] at [[Stanford University]]'s Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas. In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with a dedicated team of volunteers and financial supporters, what was called the Engelbart Colloquium or [http://www.bootstrap.org/colloquium/colloquium.html ''The Unfinished Revolution - II''], at Stanford University. The Colloquium was meant to document and publicize his work and ideas to a large audience (live, and online). The archives of this [http://scpd.stanford.edu/scpd/students/Dam_ui/pages/ArchivedVideoList.asp?Include=engelbart_colloquium ''Engelbart UnRev-II Colloquium at Stanford''] are still available online as of this writing ([[2005|September 2005]]). In December 2000, US President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Engelbart the [http://www.bootstrap.org/chronicle/pix/nmt.html ''National Medal of Technology''], the United States' highest technology award. In 2001 Engelbart was awarded a [[British Computer Society]]'s [[Lovelace Medal]]. 2005 saw Engelbart made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum and winner of the [[Norbert Wiener Award]], awarded annually by [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility]].

==At present==
Currently (at age 81 in [[As of 2006|2006]]), he is the director of his own company, the [[Bootstrap Institute]] which he founded in 1988 with his daughter, [[Christina Engelbart]]. It is located in [[Fremont, California]] and promotes Engelbart's latest refinement of his philosophy, the concept of [[Collective intelligence|Collective IQ]], and development of what he calls [http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/augment-132082.htm Open Hyper-Document Systems](OHS), and [http://www.invisiblerevolution.net/hyper-and-blog.html HyperScope], a subset of OHS. Bootstrap is housed rent-free courtesy of the [[Logitech|Logitech Corp.]], the world's largest manufacturer of computer mice.

[[Image:Brillanten.jpg|thumb|250px|A scattering of round-brilliant cut diamonds shows off the many reflecting facets.]]
&lt;!--First paragraph: Chemistry and Material Properties, Introduction, Industry Size--&gt;
'''Diamond''' is  one of the two best known forms (or ''[[allotropy|allotropes]]'') of [[carbon]], whose [[hardness]] and high [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light make it useful for industrial applications and [[Jewellery|jewelry]] (the other equally well known [[allotropes of carbon|allotrope]] is [[graphite]]). Diamonds are specifically renowned as a [[mineral]] with superlative physical qualities - they make excellent [[abrasive]]s because they can only be scratched by other diamonds, which also means they hold a polish extremely well and retain [[luster]].  About 130 million [[Carat (mass)|carats]] (26,000 kg) are mined annually, with a total value of nearly [[US dollar|USD $]]9 [[billion]].

&lt;!--Second paragraph: Etymology and Applications--&gt;
The name &quot;diamond&quot; derives from the [[Greek language|ancient Greek]] ''adamas'' (&amp;#945;&amp;#948;&amp;#940;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#962;; &quot;invincible&quot;).  They have been treasured as [[gem]]s since their use as religious [[icon]]s in [[India]] at least 2,500 years ago&amp;mdash;and usage in [[drill bit]]s and [[engraving]] tools also dates to early human history.  Popularity of diamonds has risen since the 19th century because of improved cutting and polishing techniques, and they are commonly judged by the &quot;four Cs&quot;: ''carat'', ''clarity'', ''color'', and ''cut''.  Although nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds are produced as [[synthetic diamond]] each year, the vast majority of synthetic diamond production remains small, imperfect diamonds suitable only for industrial-grade use, with gem-quality synthetic diamonds only recently becoming available.

&lt;!--Third paragraph: Mining and Distribution--&gt;
Most natural diamonds originate from central and southern [[Africa]], although significant sources of the mineral have been discovered in [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Australia]]. 
They are generally mined from [[volcanic pipe]]s, which are deep in the Earth where the high pressure and temperature enables the formation of the crystals.  The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy&amp;mdash;such as with concerns over the sale of ''[[conflict diamond|conflict diamonds]]'' by African [[paramilitary]] groups.  There are also allegations that the [[De Beers|De Beers Group]] misuses its dominance in the industry to control supply and manipulate price via [[monopoly|monopolistic]] practices.

==Material properties==
[[Image:Diamond unit cell.PNG|thumb|The [[unit cell]] of the diamond crystal.]]
{{main|Material properties of diamond}}

''See also: [[Crystallographic defects in diamond]]''

Diamond is a [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[crystal]] of pure [[carbon]] consisting of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] bonded carbon atoms. Humans have been able to adapt diamonds for many uses because of the material's exceptional physical characteristics. Most notable among these properties are the extreme [[hardness]] of diamond, its high [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] index, and high thermal conductivity. These properties form the basis for most modern applications of diamond. 

===Mechanical properties===
====Crystal structure====
Diamonds typically crystallize in the face-centered [[cubic crystal system]] and consist of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] bonded carbon atoms. The [[crystal structure#unit cell|unit cell]] of diamond has a two atom basis at (0,0,0) and (1/4,1/4,1/4), which means half of the atoms are at lattice points and the other half are offset by (1/4,1/4,1/4), where 1 is the length of a side of the unit cell.

The tetrahedral arrangement of atoms in a diamond crystal is the source of many of diamond's properties. [[Graphite]], another [[allotrope]] of carbon, has a [[rhombohedral]] crystal structure and as a result shows dramatically different physical characteristics — contrary to diamond, graphite is a very soft, dark gray, opaque mineral. Other elements of the [[carbon group]] such as [[silicon]] have forms analogous to diamond.

[[Lonsdaleite]] is a [[polymorph]] of diamond (and a distinct mineral species) that crystallizes with hexagonal symmetry; it is rarely found in nature, but is characteristic of [[synthetic diamond]]s. A [[cryptocrystal]]line variety of diamond is called [[carbonado (diamond)|carbonado]]. A colorless, grey or black diamond with a tiny radial structure is a [[spherulites|spherulite]].

====Hardness====
[[Image:Diamsm.gif|framed|The diamond crystal bond structure gives the gem its [[hardness]] and differentiates it from [[graphite]].]]
Diamond is the [[hardness|hardest]] known naturally occurring material, scoring 10 on the relative [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] and having an absolute hardness value of between 167 and 231 [[gigapascal]]s in various tests. Diamond's hardness has been known since antiquity, and is the source of its name. However, [[aggregated diamond nanorods]], an [[Carbon#Allotropes|allotrope]] of [[carbon]] first synthesized in 2005, are now believed to be even harder than diamond.

The hardest diamonds in the world are diamonds from the New England area in New South Wales, [[Australia]]. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness is considered to be a product of the crystal growth form, which is  single stage growth crystal. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws and defect planes in the crystal lattice all of which affect their hardness (Taylor et al. 1990). 

Industrial use of diamonds has historically been associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools.  It is one of the most known and most useful of more than 3,000 known minerals.   As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial adaptations of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, or use of diamond powder as an [[abrasive]]. Other specialized applications also exist or are being developed, including use as [[semiconductor]]s: some blue diamonds are natural semiconductors, in contrast to most other diamonds, which are excellent electrical [[insulator]]s. Industrial-grade diamonds are either unsuitable for use as gems or synthetically produced, which lowers their price and makes their use economically feasible.  Industrial applications, especially as [[drill bit]]s and [[engraving]] tools, also date to ancient times.

The hardness of diamonds also contributes to its suitability as a [[gemstone]]. Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well, keeping its luster over long periods of time. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of  its resistance to scratching&amp;mdash;perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in an [[engagement ring]] or [[wedding ring]], which are often worn every day.

====Toughness====
Unlike hardness, which only denotes resistance to scratching, diamond's [[toughness]] is only fair to good. Toughness relates to a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamonds cut into certain particular shapes are therefore more prone to breakage than others.

====Color====
Diamonds occur in a variety of transparent [[hue]]s &amp;mdash; colorless, [[white]], steel, [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[red]], [[green]], [[pink]], [[brown]]&amp;mdash;or colored [[black]]. Diamonds with a detectable hue to them are known as ''colored diamonds''. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the [[crystal lattice]]. The most common impurity, [[nitrogen]], causes a yellowish or brownish tinge.

====Thermodynamic stability====
At surface air pressure (one atmosphere), diamonds are not as stable as graphite, and so the decay of diamond is thermodynamically favorable ([[Gibbs free energy|&amp;Delta;''G'']]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2.99&amp;nbsp;kJ&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;mol). Diamonds will burn at approximately 800 degrees [[Celsius]], providing that enough oxygen is available. This was shown in the late 18th century, and previously described during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. However, owing to a very large kinetic energy barrier, diamonds are [[metastable]]; under [[Standard temperature and pressure|normal conditions]], it would take an extremely long time (possibly more than the age of the Universe) for diamond to decay into graphite.

===Electromagnetic properties===
[[Image:Prism rainbow schema.png|framed|Diamonds exhibit high dispersion of visible light.]]
====Optical properties====
Diamonds exhibit a high [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of visible light. This strong ability to split white light into its component colors is an important aspect of diamond's attraction as a gemstone, giving it impressive [[prism (optics)|prismatic]] action that results in so-called ''fire'' in a well-cut stone. The [[luster]] of a diamond, a characterization of how light interacts with the surface of a crystal, is brilliant and is described as ''adamantine'', which simply means diamond-like. This is owed to their high [[refractive index]] of 2.417 (at 589.3 [[1 E-9 m|nm]]), which causes [[total internal reflection]] to occur. Some diamonds exhibit [[fluorescence]] of various colors (predominately blue) under long wave [[ultraviolet light]].  Nearly all diamonds fluoresce bluish-white, yellow or green  under [[X-ray|X-rays]] and this property is used extensively in mining to separate the fluorescing diamond from the non-fluorescing rock. Most diamonds show no fluorescence although colored diamonds show a wider range of fluorescence than the blue fluorescence normally observed in clear diamonds

====Electrical properties====
Except for most [[blue]] diamonds, which are [[semiconductor]]s, diamonds are good electrical [[insulator]]s. Blue diamonds owe their semiconductive property to [[boron]] impurities, which act as a [[doping (semiconductors)|doping agent]] and cause [[p-type semiconductor]] behavior. Blue diamonds which are not boron-doped, such as those recently recovered from the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in [[Australia]] that owe their color to an overabundance of [[hydrogen]] atoms, are not semiconductors.

====Thermal properties====
Unlike most electrical insulators, diamond is a good conductor of heat because of the strong covalent bonding within the crystal. Most natural blue diamonds contain [[boron]] atoms which replace carbon atoms in the crystal matrix, and also have high thermal conductivity. Specially purified synthetic diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] (2000&amp;ndash;2500 W/(m&amp;middot;K), five times more than copper) of any known solid at room temperature. Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.

==Natural history==
===Formation===
Diamond is formed by prolonged exposure of carbon bearing materials to high [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. On [[Earth]], the formation of diamonds is possible because there are regions deep within the Earth that are at a high enough pressure and temperature that the formation of diamonds is [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] favorable (see the diamond [[phase diagram]] and [[geotherm]]s [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/diamonds/formation.html here]). Under [[continental crust]], diamonds form starting at depths of about 150 kilometers (90 miles), where pressure is roughly 5 [[pascal|gigapascal]]s and the temperature is around 1200 degrees Celsius (2200 degrees Fahrenheit). Diamond formation under [[oceanic crust]] takes place at greater depths because of higher temperatures, which require higher pressure for diamond formation. Long periods of exposure to these high pressures and temperatures allow diamond crystals to grow larger.

[[Image:Rough diamond.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The slightly misshapen octahedral shape of this rough diamond crystal in matrix is typical of the mineral. Its lustrous faces also indicate that this crystal is from a primary deposit.]]

Through studies of carbon [[isotope]] ratios (similar to the methodology used in [[carbon dating]]) except using the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13, it has been shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as ''[[Peridotite|harzburgitic]]'', are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. In contrast, ''[[eclogite|eclogitic]]'' diamonds contain organic carbon from organic [[detritus]] that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] through [[subduction]] (see [[plate tectonics]]) before transforming into diamond. These two different source carbons have measurably different &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally very old, ranging from under 1 [[billion]] to 3.3 billion years old.

Diamonds occur most often as [[euhedral]] or rounded [[octahedron|octahedra]] and [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] octahedra known as ''macles''.  As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic arrangement of the atoms, they have many [[facet]]s that belong to a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], [[octahedron]], [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], [[tetrakis hexahedron]] or [[disdyakis dodecahedron]]. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Sometimes they are found grown together or form double &quot;twinned&quot; crystals grown together at the surfaces of the octahedron. This is all due to the conditions in which they form. Diamonds (especially those from secondary deposits) are commonly found coated in ''nyf'', an opaque gum-like skin.

Diamonds can also form in other natural high-pressure, high-temperature events. Very small diamonds, known as ''microdiamonds'' or ''nanodiamonds'', have been found in [[impact crater]]s where [[meteor]]s strike the Earth and create shock zones of high pressure and temperature where diamond formation can occur. Microdiamonds are now used as one indicator of ancient [[meteorite]] impact sites.

=== Surfacing ===
[[Image:VolcanicPipe.jpg|right|thumb|float|220px|Schematic diagram of a volcanic pipe]]
Diamond-bearing rock is forced close to the surface through deep-origin [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The [[magma]] for such a volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed, 90 miles (150 km) deep or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes); this is a relatively rare occurrence. Below these typically small surface volcanic craters are formations known as [[volcanic pipe]]s, which contain material that was pushed toward the surface of the earth by volcanic action, but did not erupt before the volcanic activity ceased. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are most commonly found in the oldest regions of continental crust, which relates to the fact that these areas are the coolest portions of the earth's crust, and therefore diamonds can form at the shallowest depths.

The magma in such volcanic pipes is usually one of two characteristic types, which cool into [[igneous rock]] known as either [[kimberlite]] or [[lamproite]]. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks and material upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in [[magnesium]] bearing [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], and [[amphibole]] minerals which are usually altered to [[serpentine]] under near surface conditions. Certain ''indicator minerals'' typically occur within diamondiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogic tracers in the search for diamond deposits by prospectors. These minerals are rich in [[chromium]] (Cr) or [[titanium]] (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromian [[garnet]]s (usually bright red Cr-[[pyrope]], and occasionally green [[ugrandite]]-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange Ti-pyrope, red high chromian [[spinel]]s, dark [[chromite]], bright green
Cr-[[diopside]], glassy green [[olivine]], black [[ilmenite|picroilmenite]], and [[magnetite]]. Kimberlite deposits are known as ''blue ground'' for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as ''yellow ground'' for the near surface [[smectite]] [[clay]] and carbonate [[weathering|weathered]] and [[oxidation|oxidized]] portion.

Once diamonds have been forced to the surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may [[erosion|erode]] out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds is known as a ''primary source'' of diamonds. ''Secondary sources'' of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds, eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, accumulate because of water or weather action. These include [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their approximate size and density.  Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by [[glacier]]s (notably in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Indiana]]); however, in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are not known to be of significant concentration and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.

Diamonds can also be brought to the surface through certain processes which may occur when two continental plates collide forcefully, although this phenomenon is less understood and currently assumed to be uncommon.

==Gemological characteristics==
The use of diamonds as gemstones of decorative value is the most familiar use to most people today, and is also the earliest use, with decorative use of diamonds stretching back into antiquity.  The dispersion of white light into a rainbow of colors, known in the trade as ''fire'', is the other primary characteristic of gem diamonds, and has been highly prized throughout history.  Over time, especially since around 1900, experts in the field of ''[[gemology]]'' have developed methods of characterizing diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the ''four Cs'', are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are ''carat'', ''clarity'', ''color'', and ''cut''.

Most gem diamonds are traded on the wholesale market based on single values for each of the four Cs; for example knowing that a diamond is rated as 1.5 carats, VS2 clarity, F color, excellent cut, is enough to reasonably establish an expected price range. More detailed information from within each characteristic can then be used to determine actual market value for individual stones. Consumers who purchase individual diamonds are often advised to use the four Cs to pick the diamond that is &quot;right&quot; for them; to these is sometimes added the &quot;fifth C&quot; of ''cost''.

Other characteristics not described by the four Cs can and do influence the value or appearance of a gem diamond. These characteristics include physical characteristics such as the presence of [[fluorescence]], as well as data on a diamond's history including its source and which gemological institute performed evaluation services on the diamond.  ''Cleanliness'' also dramatically affects a diamond's beauty.

There are four major gemological associations which &quot;certify&quot; diamonds: that is, define the four Cs of a diamond. While carat weight and cut angles are mathematically defined, the clarity and color are judged by the trained human eye and are therefore open to slight variance in interpretation. 
* [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) was the first laboratory to issue modern diamond reports, and holds the highest reputation amongst gemologists for its consistent, conservative grading.
* [[American Gemological Society]] (AGS) is not as widely recognized nor as old as the GIA, but garners an equally high reputation.
* [[International Gemological Laboratory]] (IGL) is a generally respected laboratory but suffers from a negative industry reputation for its grading practices, which are perceived by critics as being either less conservative or less consistent than the GIA and AGS.
* [[European Gemological Laboratory]] (EGI) has a similar reputation to the IGL. 

=== Carat ===
The ''[[carat (mass)|carat]] weight'' measures the mass of a diamond. One carat is defined as exactly 200 [[milligram]]s (about 0.007 [[ounce]]). The ''point'' unit&amp;mdash;equal to one one-hundredth of a carat (0.01 carat, or 2 mg)&amp;mdash;is commonly used for diamonds of less than one carat. All else being equal, the value of a diamond increases exponentially in relation to carat weight, since larger diamonds are both rarer and more desirable for use as gemstones. A review of comparable diamonds available for purchase in September 2005 demonstrates this effect (approximate prices for round cut, G color, VS2 diamonds with &quot;1A&quot; cut grade, as listed on http://www.pricescope.com): &lt;!-- When updating, round to nearest $500 --&gt;

The price per carat does not increase smoothly with increasing size. Instead, there are sharp jumps around milestone carat weights, as demand is much higher for diamonds weighing just more than a milestone than for those weighing just less. As an example, a 0.95 carat diamond may have a significantly lower price per carat than a comparable 1.05 carat diamond, because of differences in demand.

A weekly price list published by Rapaport of New York, of diamond prices per carat, for different diamond cuts, clarity and weights, is currently considered the [[de-facto]] retail price baseline. Jewelers often trade diamonds at negotiated discounts off the Rapaport price (e.g., &quot;R -3%&quot;).

In the wholesale trade of gem diamonds, carat is often used in denominating lots of diamonds for sale. For example, a buyer may place an order for 100 carats of 0.5 carat, D&amp;ndash;F, VS2-SI1, excellent cut diamonds, indicating he wishes to purchase 200 diamonds (100 carats total mass) of those approximate characteristics. Because of this, diamond prices (particularly among wholesalers and other industry professionals) are often quoted per carat, rather than per stone.

''Total carat weight'' (t.c.w.) is a phrase used to describe the total mass of diamonds or other gemstone in a piece of jewelry, when more than one gemstone is used. Diamond solitaire earrings, for example, are usually quoted in t.c.w. when placed for sale, indicating the mass of the diamonds in both earrings and not each individual diamond. T.c.w. is also widely used for diamond necklaces, bracelets and other similar jewelry pieces.

===Clarity===
{{main|Diamond clarity}}
Clarity is a measure of internal defects of a diamond called ''inclusions''. Inclusions may be crystals of a foreign material or another diamond crystal, or structural imperfections such as tiny cracks that can appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. The [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) and others have developed systems to grade clarity, which are generally based on those inclusions which are visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above, under 10x magnification.

Diamonds become increasingly rare when considering higher clarity gradings. Only about 20 percent of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high enough for the diamond to be considered appropriate for use as a gemstone; the other 80 percent are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20 percent, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are visible to the naked eye upon close inspection. Those that do not have a visible inclusion are known as &quot;eye-clean&quot; and are preferred by most buyers, although visible inclusions can sometimes be hidden under the setting in a piece of jewelry.

Most inclusions present in gem-quality diamonds do not affect the diamonds' performance or structural integrity. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.

Diamonds are graded by the major societies on a scale ranging from Flawless to Imperfect.  (see the main article for more detail)

===Color===
{{main|Diamond color}}
[[Image:ThompsonDiamonds.JPG|thumbnail|right|Jewelers sometimes set diamonds in groups of similar colors.]]
[[Image:Hope_Diamond.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hope Diamond]]]]
A chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond is perfectly transparent with no [[hue]], or '''color'''. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect. The color of a diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the [[crystal lattice]]. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price as more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink or blue diamonds (such as the [[Hope Diamond]]) can be dramatically more valuable.

Most diamonds used as gemstones are basically transparent with little tint, or ''white diamonds''. The most common impurity, [[nitrogen]], replaces a small proportion of carbon atoms in a diamond's structure and causes a yellowish to brownish tint. This effect is present in almost all white diamonds; in only the rarest diamonds is the coloration due to this effect undetectable. The GIA has developed a rating system for color in white diamonds, from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; (with D being &quot;colorless&quot; and Z having a bright yellow coloration), which has been widely adopted in the industry and is universally recognized, superseding several older systems once used in different countries. The system uses a benchmark set of either natural diamonds of known color grade, or precision-crafted [[cubic zirconia]]; test lighting conditions are also standardized and carefully controlled. Diamonds with higher color grades are rarer, in higher demand, and therefore more expensive, than lower color grades. Oddly enough, diamonds graded Z are also rare, and the bright yellow color is also highly valued. Diamonds graded D-F are considered &quot;colorless&quot;, G-J are considered &quot;near-colorless&quot;, K-M are &quot;slightly colored&quot;. N-Y are usually appear light yellow or brown. 

In contrast to yellow or brown hues, diamonds of other colors are much rarer and more valuable. While even a pale pink or blue hue may increase the value of a diamond, more intense coloration is usually considered more desirable and commands the highest prices. A variety of impurities and structural imperfections cause different colors in diamonds, including yellow, pink, blue, red, green, brown, and other hues. Diamonds with unusual or intense coloration are sometimes labeled &quot;fancy&quot; by the diamond industry. Intense yellow coloration is considered one of the fancy colors, and is separate from the color grades of white diamonds. Gemologists have developed rating systems for fancy colored diamonds, but they are not in common use because of the relative rarity of colored diamonds.

===Cut===
{{main|Diamond cut}}
[[Diamond cutting]] is the art and science of creating a gem-quality diamond out of mined rough. The ''cut'' of a diamond describes the manner in which a diamond has been shaped and polished from its beginning form as a rough stone to its final gem proportions. The cut of a diamond describes the quality of workmanship and the angles to which a diamond is cut. Often diamond cut is confused with &quot;shape.&quot; 

There are mathematical guidelines for the angles and length ratios at which the diamond is supposed to cut at in order to reflect the maximum amount of light. Round brilliant diamonds, the most common, are guided by these specific guidelines, though fancy cut stones are not able to be as accurately guided by mathematical specifics.

The techniques for cutting diamonds have been developed over hundreds of years, with perhaps the greatest achievements made in 1919 by [[mathematician]] and gem enthusiast [[Marcel Tolkowsky]]. He developed the [[brilliant (diamond cut)|round brilliant cut]] by calculating the ideal shape to return and scatter light when a diamond is viewed from above. The modern round brilliant has 57 facets (polished faces), counting 33 on the ''crown'' (the top half), and 24 on the ''pavilion'' (the lower half). The girdle is the thin unpolished middle. The function of the crown is to diffuse light into various colors and the pavilion's function to reflect light back through the top of the diamond.

Tolkowsky defines the ideal dimensions to have:
* Table percentage (table diameter divided by overall diameter) = 53%
* Depth percentage (Overall depth divided by the overall diameter) = 59.3%
* Pavilion Angle (Angle between the girdle and the pavilion) = 40.75°
* Crown Angle (Angle between the girdle and the crown) = 34.5°
* Pavilion Depth (Depth of pavilion divided by overall diameter) = 43.1%
* Crown Depth (Depth of crown divided by crown diameter) = 16.2%

The culet is the tiny point at the bottom of the diamond. This should be a negligible diameter, otherwise light leaks out of the bottom. Tolkowsky's ideal dimensions did not include a girdle. However, a thin girdle is required in reality in order to prevent the diamond from easily chipping in the setting. A normal girdle should be about 1%&amp;ndash;2% of the overall diameter.

The further the diamond's characteristics are from Tolkowsky's ideal, the less light will be reflected. However, there is a small range in which the diamond can be considered &quot;ideal.&quot; Today, because of the relative importance of carat weight in society, many diamonds are often intentionally cut poorly to increase carat weight. There is a financial premium for a diamond that weighs the magical 1.0 carat, so often the girdle is made thicker or the depth is increased. Neither of these tactics make the diamond appear any bigger, but it also greatly reduces the sparkle of the diamond. So a poorly cut 1.0 carat diamond may have the same diameter and appear as large as a 0.85 carat diamond. The depth percentage is the overall quickest indication of the quality of the cut of a round brilliant. &quot;Ideal&quot; round brilliant diamonds should not have a depth percentage greater than 62.5%. Another quick indication is the overall diameter. Typically a round brilliant 1.0 carat diamond should have a diameter of about 6.5 mm. Mathematically, the diameter in millimeters of a round brilliant should approximately equal 6.5 times the [[cube root]] of carat weight, or 11.1 times the cube root of gram weight. 

====Shape====
Diamonds do not show all of their beauty as rough stones; instead, they must be cut and polished to exhibit the characteristic fire and brilliance that diamond gemstones are known for. Diamonds are cut into a variety of shapes that are generally designed to accentuate these features. 

Diamonds which are not cut to the specifications of Tolkowsky's round brilliant shape (or subsequent variations) are known as &quot;fancy cuts.&quot; Popular fancy cuts include the ''baguette'' (from the French, resembling a [[baguette|loaf of bread]]), ''marquise'', ''princess'' (square outline), ''heart'', ''briolette'' (a form of the rose cut), and ''pear'' cuts. Generally speaking, these &quot;fancy cuts&quot; are not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants and there are less specific mathematical guidelines of angles which determine a well-cut stone. Cuts are influenced heavily by fashion: the baguette cut&amp;mdash;which accentuates a diamond's luster and downplays its fire&amp;mdash;was all the rage during the [[Art Deco]] period, whereas the princess cut&amp;mdash;which accentuates a diamond's fire rather than its luster&amp;mdash;is currently gaining popularity. The princess cut is also popular amongst diamond cutters: of all the cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. The past decades have seen the development of new diamond cuts, often based on a modification of an existing
cut. Some of these include extra facets. These newly developed cuts are viewed by many as more of an attempt at brand differentiation by diamond sellers, than actual improvements to the state of the art.

====Quality====
The quality of a diamond's cut is widely considered the most important of the four Cs in determining the beauty of a diamond; indeed, it is commonly acknowledged that a well-cut diamond can appear to be of greater carat weight, and have clarity and color appear to be of better grade than they actually are. The skill with which a diamond is cut determines its ability to reflect and refract light.

In addition to carrying the most importance to a diamond's quality as a gemstone, the cut is also the most difficult to quantitatively judge. A number of factors, including proportion, [[symmetry]], and the relative angles of various facets, are determined by the quality of the cut and can affect the performance of a diamond. A poorly cut diamond with facets cut only a few degrees out of alignment can result in a poorly performing stone. For a round brilliant cut, there is a balance between &quot;brilliance&quot; and &quot;fire.&quot; When a diamond is cut for too much &quot;fire,&quot; it looks like a [[cubic zirconia]], which gives off much more &quot;fire&quot; than real diamond. A well executed round brilliant cut should reflect most light out from the tabletop and make the diamond appear white when viewed from the top. An inferior cut will produce a stone that appears dark at the center and in some extreme cases the ring settings may show through the top of the diamond as shadows.

Several different theories on the &quot;ideal&quot; proportions of a diamond have been and continue to be advocated by professional gemologists. Recently, there has been a shift away from grading cut by the use of various angles and proportions toward measuring the performance of a cut stone. A number of specially modified viewers and machines have been developed toward this end. They included the FireScope, a.k.a. SymmetriScope or IdealScope (tests for light leakage, light return and proportions), Hearts and Arrows Viewer (test for &quot;[[hearts and arrows]]&quot; characteristic pattern observable on stones exhibiting high symmetry), GemEx BrillianceScope (tests for direct light performance results of a diamond), Isee2 Machine (tests for diffused light performance results of a diamond), and ASET (test for AGS cut grade).  These viewers and machines often help consumers determine the light performance results of the diamond in addition to the traditional 4 C's.  Along with this shift there are a few companies that provide results on these viewers and machines in addition to the original 4c's.

====The cutting process====
{{main|Diamond cutting}}

[[Image:DiamanteEZ.jpg|thumb|An uncut diamond does not show its prized optical properties.]]

The process of shaping a rough diamond into a polished gemstone is both an art and a science. The choice of cut is often decided by the original shape of the rough stone, location of the inclusions and flaws to be eliminated, the preservation of the weight, popularity of certain shapes amongst consumers and many other considerations. The round brilliant cut is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly shaped crystals such as macles are more likely to be cut in a ''fancy cut''&amp;mdash;that is, a cut other than the round brilliant&amp;mdash;which the particular crystal shape lends itself to.

Even with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve the carat rating. Since the per carat price of diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat diamonds are the result of compromising &quot;Cut&quot; for &quot;Carat.&quot; Some jewelry experts advise consumers to buy a 0.99 carat diamond for its better price or buy a 1.10 carat diamond for its better cut, avoiding a 1.00 carat diamond which is more likely to be a poorly cut stone.

===Cleaning===
{{main|Jewelry cleaning}}
Although it is not one of the four Cs, ''cleanliness'' affects a diamond's beauty as much as any of the four Cs.  A clean diamond is more brilliant and fiery than the same diamond when it is &quot;dirty.&quot;  Dirt or grease on the top of a diamond reduces its luster.  Water, dirt, or grease on the bottom of a diamond interferes with the diamond's brilliance and fire.  Even a thin film absorbs some light that could have been reflected to the person looking at the diamond.  Colored dye or smudges can affect the perceived color of a diamond.  Historically, some jewelers' stones were misgraded because of smudges on the girdle, or dye on the culet.  Current practice is to thoroughly clean a diamond before grading its color.

Maintaining a clean diamond can sometimes be difficult, as jewelry settings can obstruct cleaning efforts, and oils, grease, and other [[hydrophobic]] materials adhere well to a diamond's surface.  Some jewelers provide their customers with [[ammonia]]-based cleaning kits; [[ultrasonic cleaner]]s are also popular.

Cleanliness does not affect the diamond's market value, as any competent jeweler will clean the diamond before offering it for sale.  However, cleanliness might reflect a diamond's sentimental value:  some jewelers have noted a correlation between ring cleanliness and marriage quality [http://www.diamondcuttersintl.com/diamond_education/articles/customers/getting_in_shape.html].

==History==
Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in [[India]], where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could then be found.  The earliest written reference can be found in the [[Sanskrit]] text ''[[Arthasastra]]'', which was completed around [[296 BCE]], describes diamond's hardness, luster, and dispersion.  Diamonds quickly became associated with divinity, being used to decorate religious [[icon]]s, and were believed to bring good fortune to those who carried them.  Ownership was restricted among various [[caste]]s by color, with only kings being allowed to own all colors of diamond.

In February 2005, a joint [[China|Chinese]]-U.S. team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] reported the discovery of four [[corundum]]-rich stone ceremonial burial [[axe]]s originating from China's [[Liangzhu jade culture|Liangzhu]] and [[Sanxingcun]] cultures ([[4000 BCE]]&amp;ndash;[[2500 BCE]]) which, because of the axes' specular surfaces, the scientists believe were polished using diamond powder [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm] [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-02/18/content_417247.htm].  Although there are diamond deposits now known to exist close to the burial sites, no direct evidence of coeval diamond mining has been found: the researchers came to this conclusion by polishing corundum using various [[lapidary]] abrasives and modern techniques then comparing the results using an [[atomic force microscope]].  At that scale, the surface of the modern diamond-polished corundum closely resembled that of the axes; however, the polishes of the latter were superior.

Diamonds were traded to both the east and west of India and were recognized by various cultures for their gemological or industrial uses.  The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] writer [[Pliny the Elder]] noted diamond's ornamental uses, as well as its usefulness to [[engraving|engravers]] because of its hardness, in his work ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.  In China, diamonds seem to have been used primarily for engraving [[jade]] and drilling holes in beads.  Archaeological evidence from [[Yemen]] suggests that diamonds were used as drill tips as early as the [[4th century BCE]].  In [[Europe]], however, diamonds disappeared for almost 1,000 years following the rise of [[Christianity]] because of two effects: early [[Christian]]s rejected diamonds because of their earlier use in [[amulet]]s, and [[Arab|Arabic]] traders restricted the flow of trade between Europe and India.

[[Image:Diamond cut history.png|right|thumb|350px|Diagram of old diamond cuts showing the evolution from the most primitive (point cut) to the most advanced pre-[[Marcel Tolkowsky|Tolkowsky]] cut (old European).]]

Until the late [[Middle Ages]], diamonds were most prized in their natural octahedral state, perhaps with the crystal surfaces polished to increase luster and remove foreign material.  Around [[1300s|1300]], the flow of diamonds into Europe increased via [[Venice]]'s trade network, with most flowing through the [[low Countries|low country]] ports of [[Bruges]], [[Antwerp]], and [[Amsterdam]].  During this time, the [[taboo]] against cutting diamonds into gem shapes, which was established over 1,000 years earlier in the traditions of India, ended allowing the development of diamond cutting technology to begin in earnest. By 1375, a guild of diamond polishers had been established at [[Nuremberg]].  Over the following centuries, various diamond cuts were introduced which increasingly demonstrated the fire and brilliance that makes diamonds treasured today: the ''table cut'', the ''briolette'' (around 1476), the ''rose cut'' (mid-16th century), and by the mid-17th century, the ''Mazarin'', the first [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliant cut diamond]] design.  In 1919, [[Marcel Tolkowsky]] developed an ''ideal'' round brilliant cut design that has set the standard for comparison of modern gems; however, diamond cuts have continued to be refined.

The rise in popularity of diamonds as gems seems to have paralleled increasing availability through European history.  In the 13th century, King [[Louis IX of France]] established a law that only the king could own diamonds.  However, within a century diamonds were popular gems among the moneyed [[aristocrat]]ic and merchant classes, and by at latest 1477 had begun to be used in [[wedding ring]]s.  Popularity continued to rise as new cuts were developed that enhanced the diamond's aesthetic appeal, and has largely continued unabated to this day; diamonds have proven popular with all classes in society as their cost has become within reach.  A number of large diamonds have become historically significant objects, as their inclusion in various sets of [[crown jewels]] and the purchase, sale, and sometimes theft of notable diamonds, have sometimes become politicized.

===Record-holding diamonds===
The [[Cullinan Diamond]], owned by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905), at 3,106.75 carats.  One of the diamonds cut from it, Cullinan I or the Great Star of Africa, was formerly the largest cut diamond at 530.2 carats, but now that title has been taken by [[the Golden Jubilee]] (1985), a 545.67 carat yellow-brown diamond.  The largest flawless and colorless (grade D) diamond is the [[Centenary Diamond]] which weighs 273.85 carats. The [[Millennium Star]] is the second largest (1990) at 203.04 carats.

== The diamond industry ==
[[Image:Diamond.jpg|framed|A round [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliant cut]] diamond set in a ring.]]

The diamond industry can be broadly separated into two basically distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.

===Gem diamond industry===
A large trade in [[gem]]-grade diamonds exists.  Unlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.  One hallmark of the trade in gem-quality diamonds is its remarkable concentration: wholesale trade and diamond cutting is limited to a few locations (most importantly New York, [[Antwerp]], [[London]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Surat]]), and a single company&amp;mdash;[[De Beers]]&amp;mdash;controls over half of all trade in diamonds.  They are based in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] and [[London]], [[England]].

The production and distribution of diamonds is largely consolidated in the hands of a few key players, and concentrated in traditional diamond trading centers (the most important being [[Antwerp]]).  The De Beers company holds a clearly dominant position in the industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888.  De Beers owns or controls a significant portion of the world's rough diamond production facilities ([[mining|mines]]) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds.  The company and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40 percent of annual world diamond production, and control distribution channels handling nearly two thirds of all gem diamonds.  At one time it was thought over 80 percent of the world's rough diamonds passed through the [[Diamond Trading Company]] (DTC, a subsidiary of [[De Beers]]) in [[London]], but presently the figure is estimated at around 60 percent.  De Beers has used its [[monopoly]] position to establish strict price controls, and aggressively market diamonds directly to consumers in world markets.

The [[De Beers#Marketing|De Beers diamond advertising campaign]] is acknowledged as one of the most successful and innovative ones in history.  [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]], the advertising firm retained by De Beers in the mid-20th century, succeeded in reviving the American diamond market and opened up new markets, even in countries where no diamond tradition had existed before.  N.W. Ayer's multifaceted marketing campaign included [[product placement]], advertising the diamond itself rather than the De Beers brand, and building associations with celebrities and royalty.  This coordinated campaign has lasted decades and continues today; it is perhaps best captured by the now-familiar [[slogan]] &quot;a diamond is forever&quot;.

=== Industrial diamond industry ===
The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20,000 kg annually), unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80,000 kg) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use&amp;mdash;nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period.  

The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are gem-quality except for their small size, can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see [[diamond anvil]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s.

With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[microchip]]s from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]]. Significant research efforts in [[Japan]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]] are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers.

=== Diamond supply chain ===
''See also: [[List of diamond mines]]''

The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world. In fact, the amount of power which De Beers has consolidated historically prevented it from direct trade with the [[United States]], as its trade practices led to an [[indictment]] for violating [[Sherman Antitrust Act|antitrust regulations]] (the case was settled in 2004). The concentration of power only loosens at the retail level, where diamonds are sold by a limited number of distributors, known as [[sightholder]]s, to jewelers around the world.

[[Image:Childrenmining 300.jpg|thumb|Alluvial mining by traditional methods continues, as seen here in [[Sierra Leone]].]]

==== Sources ====
Historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in [[southern India]]; India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the [[9th century BCE]] to the mid-[[18th century|18th century CE]], but the commercial potential of these sources has been exhausted.  The first non-Indian diamond source was found in [[Brazil]] in 1725.  Today, most commercially viable diamond deposits are in [[Africa]], notably in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], [[Siberia]] (mostly in [[Sakha|Yakutia territory]], for example [[Mir pipe]] and [[Udachnaya pipe]]), Brazil, and in Northern and Western [[Australia]]. Diamond prospectors continue to search the globe for diamond-bearing kimberlite and lamproite pipes.

In some of the more politically unstable central African and west African countries, revolutionary groups have taken control of diamond mines, using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations. Diamonds sold through this process are known as ''[[conflict diamond]]s'' or ''blood diamonds''. In response to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing to war and human rights abuses in central Africa and west Africa, the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the [[Kimberley Process]] in 2002, which is aimed at ensuring that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups. The Kimberley Process provides documentation and certification of diamond exports from producing countries to ensure that the proceeds of sale are not being used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities. Although the Kimberly Process has been somewhat successful in limiting the number of conflict diamonds entering the market, conflict diamonds smuggled to market continue to persist to some degree.

Currently, gem production totals nearly 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of cut and polished stones annually, and over 100 million carats (20,000 kg) of diamonds are sold for industrial use each year. In 2003, this constituted total production of nearly US$9 [[billion]] in value.

==== Distribution ====
The [[Diamond Trading Company]], or DTC, is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds produced both by De Beers mines and other mines from which it purchases rough diamond production; in whole, about two thirds of all rough diamonds pass through the company. DTC performs sophisticated sorting of rough diamonds into over 16,000 categories, and then sells bulk lots of rough diamonds to a limited number of sightholders a few times a year.

Once purchased by sightholders, diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones. The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in a limited number of locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are [[Antwerp]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Johannesburg]], [[New York, New York|New York]], and [[Tel Aviv]]. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in [[China]], [[India]], and [[Thailand]]. Cutting centers with lower [[cost of labor|costs of labor]], notably [[Surat]] in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds are more likely to be handled in [[Europe]] or [[North America]]. Demonstrating this, India produces 90% of all cut and polished diamonds by number, but only 55% by value. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems than was previously economically feasible.

Diamonds which have been prepared as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called ''bourses''. There are 24 registered diamond bourses. This is the final tightly controlled step in the diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or as is increasingly popular, sold unset (&quot;loose&quot;). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9 billion as rough diamonds, US$14 billion after being cut and polished, US$28 billion in wholesale diamond [[jewelry]], and retail sales of US$57 billion.

===Synthetics, simulants, and enhancements===
{{main|Synthetic diamond}}
{{main|Diamond simulants}}
{{main|Diamond enhancement}}
The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for raw stones. A portion of this demand is now being met by [[synthetic diamond]]s, man-made diamonds which have similar properties to natural diamonds. This process has historically produced industrial-grade diamonds, but synthetic diamond producers have recently begun to penetrate the gem diamond market. Diamonds have been manufactured synthetically for over fifty years.

A diamond's gem quality, which is not as dependent on material properties as industrial applications, has invited both imitation and the invention of procedures to enhance the gemological properties of natural diamonds. Materials which have similar gemological characteristics to diamond but are not real mined or synthetic diamond are known as ''diamond simulants''. The most familiar diamond simulant to most consumers is [[cubic zirconia]] (commonly abbreviated as CZ); recently [[moissanite]] has also gained cachet as a popular diamond simulant. Both CZ and moissanite are synthetically produced for use as a diamond simulant. Diamond enhancements are specific treatments, performed on natural diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which are designed to better the gemological characteristics of the stone in one or more ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.

Currently, trained gemologists with appropriate equipment are able to distinguish natural diamonds from all synthetic and simulant diamonds, and identify all enhanced natural diamonds. The established natural diamond industry has a vested interest in maintaining the distinction between natural diamonds and other diamonds, and has made significant investments toward that end. However, synthetic diamonds may one day be indistinguishable from natural diamonds, and new techniques for simulants (such as coating them with a very thin diamond-like layer of carbon) are making it harder to easily distinguish between simulants and real diamonds.

==Symbolism==
[[Image:Mary of burgundy.jpg|right|thumb|Mary of Burgundy is the first known recipient of a diamond engagement ring, in 1477.]]
Because of their extraordinary physical properties, diamonds have been used symbolically since near the time of their first discovery. Perhaps the earliest symbolic use of diamonds was as the eyes of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] devotional statues. The diamonds themselves were thought to be endowments from the gods and were therefore cherished. The point at which diamonds began to be associated with divinity is not known, but early texts indicate that it was recognized in [[India]] since at least [[400 BCE]]. It is said the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] believed diamonds were tears of the gods; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed they were splinters of fallen stars. Many long dead cultures have sought to explain diamond's superlative properties through divine or mystical affiliations.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] (Diamond Vehicle), diamonds are an important symbol, and the [[Diamond Sutra]] is one of the most popular texts.

In Western culture, diamonds are the traditional emblem of fearlessness and virtue, but have also often associated with power, wealth, crime and misfortune. Today, diamonds are used to symbolize eternity and love, being often seen adorning [[engagement ring]]s and sometimes [[wedding ring]]s as well. The popularity of this modern tradition can be traced directly to the marketing campaigns of De Beers, starting in 1938. Prior to the [[De Beers]] marketing campaign, engagement rings had no one particular stone associated with them. The first diamond engagement ring can be traced to the marriage of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] (then Archduke of [[Austria]]) to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477. Other early examples of betrothal jewels incorporating diamonds include the ''Bridal Crown of Blanche'' (ca. 1370&amp;ndash;80) and the ''Heftlein'' brooch of Vienna (ca. 1430&amp;ndash;40), a pictorial piece depicting a wedding couple. Inaccessibility of diamonds to the vast majority of the population limited the popularity of diamonds as betrothal jewels during this period.


The [[LifeGem]] company further taps modern symbolism by offering to synthetically convert the carbonized remains of people or pets into &quot;memorial diamonds.&quot; However, many people feel very uncomfortable at the thought of wearing the carbonized remains of people as jewelry.

The diamond is the [[birthstone]] for people born in the month of [[April]], and is also used as the symbol of a sixty-year [[anniversary]], such as a [[Diamond Jubilee]] (see ''[[hierarchy of precious substances]]'').

Diamonds are a common focus of fiction. Notable pieces of fiction include [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1956), [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' (1988) and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' (1995). In addition, diamonds are the subject of various myths and legends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the Los Angeles rapper and producer Dr. Dre.  For the New York radio and television presenter, see [[Doctor Dre]]'' 
[[Image:DR-DRE.jpg|frame|Dr.Dre|right]]
'''Dr. Dre''' (born '''Andre Romel Young''' on [[February 18]], [[1965]], in [[Compton, California|Compton]], [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an [[African-American]] [[record producer]], [[rapper]], and record executive, and is one of the wealthiest, most influential, most successful and well-known producers in the field of [[hip hop music]].

Dre became famous as a member of iconic [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]], continuing his success as a best-selling solo rapper, and most famously, the founder of record labels [[Death Row Records]] and [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. He is notable for having launched the careers of rap superstars [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Eminem]], and is widely regarded as one of hip hop's greatest producers. The artists on his sizeable Aftermath roster today include [[RIAA|multi-platinum]] artists such as [[Eminem]], [[50 Cent]], and more recently [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] and of course Dr. Dre himself.

Dr. Dre has made three solo albums, [[The Chronic]], [[Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath]], [[2001 (album) | 2001]]. 

==Biography==
Dr. Dre started his producing career as a member of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] during the first half of the [[1980s]]. In [[1986]], he and fellow World Class Wreckin' Cru member [[DJ Yella]] were two of the founding members of N.W.A, a highly successful and controversial group which created the prototype for much of what was termed &quot;gangsta rap&quot; in the [[1990s]]. On the other hand, Dre's rapping style and image was still very much evolving at the time. Take, for example, his verse on the song &quot;Express Yourself&quot; off the album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'':

:Some drop science; while I'm droppin' english
:Even if Yella, makes it [[A cappella|a-capella]]
:I still express, yo, I don't smoke [[cannabis (drug)|weed]] or cess
:Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
:And brain damage on the mic don't manage - NUTHIN
:but makin' a sucka and you equal
:Don't be another sequel..
(NWA, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;)

Dr. Dre enjoyed significant success in N.W.A.. After a dispute with [[Eazy-E]], a founding member of N.W.A. and [[Ruthless Records]], Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in [[1991]] to form Death Row Records with Suge Knight.

Dr. Dre released his first solo single, &quot;[[Deep Cover (single)|Deep Cover]],&quot;(AKA 187) in the spring of [[1992]]. This was the beginning of his collaboration with rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg (who is now simply known as &quot;Snoop Dogg&quot;, following his departure from [[Death Row Records]],) a young man who had recorded some homemade tapes with Dre's stepbrother [[Warren G]]. Warren G played Dre some of Snoop's [[mixtape]]s and Dre arranged a meeting with the young man, beginning a lifelong association. [[Image:Dr.DreTheChronicalbumcover.jpg|frame|Dr. Dre's Chronic|right]]
Snoop's voice appeared on Dre's [[1992]] debut album ''[[The Chronic]]'' as much as Dre's did.  Thanks to the single &quot;[[Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang]],&quot; and hits like &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; and &quot;Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')&quot;, ''The Chronic'' became a multi-platinum seller, making it virtually impossible to hear mainstream hip-hop that wasn't affected in some way by Dr. Dre. Shortly after its release, [[The Chronic]] became one of the biggest-selling hip hop albums in history. The song &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; won Dre the 1993 Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. &quot;The Chronic&quot; was followed shortly by a string of multi-platinum albums from Dre’s protégés, including Snoop Dogg’s debut album [[Doggystyle]] and [[Warren G]]’s ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]''. 

The following year, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album ''Doggystyle'', with similar subject matter and musical style. ''Doggystyle'' achieved phenomenal success, being the first debut album for an artist to debut at #1 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts.

In [[1996]], the song &quot;California Love,&quot; a highly successful collaboration with [[Death Row Records | Death Row]] artist [[Tupac Shakur]], helped further establish [[Death Row Records | Death Row]] and Dr. Dre as a major force in the music industry. By the end of the year, however, the success of [[Death Row Records | Death Row]] had taken a reverse turn, following the death of [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[racketeering]] charges against [[Suge Knight]]. Foreseeing the label's collapse, Dr. Dre left [[Death Row Records | Death Row]] to form his own [[Aftermath Entertainment]] label. The ''[[Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath]]'' album, released at the end of the year, featured songs by the newly signed [[Aftermath Entertainment | Aftermath]] artists, and a solo track &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;. The track was intended as a symbolic good-bye to [[gangsta-rap]], in which Dre suggested that he is moving on to another level of music and lifestyle. While going platinum, the album was considered a commercial disappointment by Dre's standards, and was a critical failure as well.

In 1997, Dre produced ''[[Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album]]''; while also going platinum, the album met with similarly negative reviews from critics.

The turning point for Aftermath came in [[1998]], when Dre signed aspiring Detroit rapper Eminem to his label, producing his controversial album ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' in [[1999]], followed by the even more successful and controversial ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' in [[2000]]. Though he was heavily involved in the latter, producing five beats with collaborator [[Mel-Man]], by the time ''[[The Eminem Show]]'' was released in [[2002]], Eminem was producing the bulk of his output himself. However, ''[[Encore (album)|Encore]]'' featured substantially increased production involvement from Dre.

He released his second solo album, ''[[Dr. Dre 2001]]'' (sometimes referred to by fans as ''&quot;The Chronic 2001: No Seeds&quot;''), or more often simply '2001' in 1999. Once again, the album featured about as much of Dre's voice as the voices of numerous collaborators, including [[Devin the Dude]], [[Hittman]], Snoop Dogg, and Eminem. The album was highly successful, thus reaffirming a recurring theme featured in its lyrics, stating that Dre is still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. 

In 2000, Dr. Dre won the Grammy award for Producer Of The Year, for his work on &quot;[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]&quot; and &quot;2001&quot;. The albums followed a new musical direction, characterised by high-pitched piano and string melodies over a deep and rich [[bassline]]. The style was also prominent in his following production work for other artists, including hits such as &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; by Eve and [[Gwen Stefani]] (whom he would produce again on the Stefani and Eve track &quot;Rich Girl&quot;), &quot;Break Ya Neck&quot; by Busta Rhymes, and &quot;Family Affair&quot; by [[Mary J. Blige]].

Dr. Dre has also appeared in the movies ''[[Set It Off]]'', ''[[The Wash (movie)|The Wash]]'' and ''[[Training Day]]'', though he later stated that he does not intend to pursue a career in acting. A song of his, &quot;Bad Intentions&quot; (featuring [[Knoc-Turn'Al]]) and produced by Mahogany, was featured on the [[soundtrack]] to ''[[The Wash (movie)|The Wash]]''. Dre also appeared on two other songs &quot;On the Blvd.&quot; and &quot;The Wash&quot; along with his co-star Snoop Dogg.

In [[2003]], Dr. Dre and Eminem produced the major-label debut ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' for [[Queens]] rapper 50 Cent, featuring the Dre-produced hit single &quot;[[In Da Club]].&quot;

The release of ''[[Detox (album)|Detox]]'', which was to be Dre's final solo album, was planned for [[2004]]. The project was declared to be cancelled for a while, as Dre decided to put all his effort into producing the artists on his [[Aftermath Entertainment | Aftermath]] label, including Eminem, 50 Cent, Eve, The Game, Stat Quo, and Busta Rhymes; former N.W.A member [[Ice Cube]] is currently negotiating a contract with the label.  However, in [[November]] 2004, Dre and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] confirmed that ''Detox'' was still in the works and is currently scheduled to be released in late [[2006]]. On Eminem's song &quot;[[Encore (song)|Encore]]&quot;, featuring Dre himself, Eminem mentions that the Eminem crew will &quot;make&quot; him do the album. Dre will also be producing Snoop Dogg's next album, ''[[The Blue Carpet Treatment]]'' which will be released in 2006.

'''Delicate Arch''' is a remarkable freestanding [[natural arch]] located in [[Arches National Park]] near [[Moab, Utah|Moab]], [[Utah]]. 

It is the most widely-recognized [[landmark]] in Arches National Park and is depicted on both Utah [[license plate]]s and a [[postage stamp]] commemorating Utah's [[centennial]] anniversary of [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|statehood]] in [[1996]]. The [[Olympic torch]] [[relay]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] passed through the arch.

The Delicate Arch is located at the end of a moderately strenuous, 1.5-mile (2.4 km) hiking trail from the parking area at [[Wolfe Ranch]]. Taking more than an hour each way, the round trip is slightly more than 3 miles long and the Arch is completely hidden from view on this trail.  The first third of the hike gains only a slight elevation, but is through rugged, brushy terrain. On the middle third of the hike the trail is nearly invisible, along the face of an exposed [[entrada|slickrock]] outcrop. Slickrock is not slick at all, but has a surface much like [[sandpaper]]. The elevation gain on this section is strenuous, but offers some excellent pauses to see the [[geology]] in the salt valley more clearly. Cairns (piles of rocks) have been placed by visitors and park staff to roughly suggest the trail to the top.  But visitors will enjoy the huge expanse of completely exposed [[sandstone]] and tend to wander all over the mountain.  Aiming for the top of the slickrock, mostly to the right(south)side will bring you to the correct trail at the top.  The latter third of the trail is the most rugged, as hikers have now nearly reached the &quot;top&quot; of the plateau.  The Arch is still invisible, and the trail runs around outcrops, through washes and between stands of twisted brush and trees.  The trail may be easier to follow, but will tend to wander as parts become muddy and difficult to walk through.  During the 2004 fall season, the trail clearly followed the left (northern) side of the plateau, and brought visitors along a breathtakingly narrow shelf nearly 150 feet above a dry wash.  The arch rises suddenly into view around a corner in the trail and spectacularly frames the [[Manti-La Sal National Forest|La Sal Mountains]] to the east.  Plan on spending at least an hour at the Arch, due to the need to take a lot of pictures. Step carefully, the geology at the arch is unbelievable, and very rugged.  Small children (4 years and up) can make this hike, with frequent stops and lots of water, but they will need to be closely monitored at the Arch as many of the unguarded cliffs plunge a hundred feet or more.  The views of the southern expanse of the park are spellbinding. Visitors are strongly cautioned to be aware of weather conditions prior to the hike, as the entire trail is exposed to the elements.

Because of its distinctive shape, the arch was known as &quot;the Chaps&quot; and &quot;the Schoolmarm's Bloomers&quot; by local cowboys. It was given its current name by Frank Beckwith, leader of the Arches National Monument Scientific Expedition, who explored the area in the winter of [[1933]]-[[1934]]. (The story that the names of Delicate Arch and [[Landscape Arch]] were inadvertently exchanged due to a signage mixup by the [[National Park Service]] is false.)

The arch played no part in the original designation of the area as a [[U.S. National Monument]] in [[1929]], and was not included within the original boundaries; it was added when the monument was enlarged in [[1938]]. In the [[1950s]], the National Park Service investigated the possibility of applying a clear [[plastic]] coating to the arch to protect it from further [[erosion]] and eventual destruction. The idea was ultimately abandoned as impractical and contrary to NPS principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''deed poll''' is a [[Law|legal]] document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. It is strictly speaking not a [[contract]] because it only binds one [[party (law)|party]] and expresses an intention instead of a promise.

The most common use is a [[name change]] through a [[Deed of Change of Name]] (often simply referred to as a '''Deed Poll'''). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], some [[States and territories of Australia]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].

Another common use is to [[partition]] land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out), by a '''Deed Poll''', into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of Deed Poll is commonly used in [[Hong Kong]], where the development and redevelopment of land is rapid and flourishing.

It should be noted that citizens of [[Scotland]] whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] there are not required to undergo deed poll to change their name - they need only inform people of their new name.  After two years the person can apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their [[birth certificate]] amended to show the new name.  This is in addition to changes of [[surname]] by [[marriage]].  [[Scots law]] only requires that no one changes their name with the intent to [[fraud|defraud]].

==Origin of the term==

The name ''deed'', also known in this context as a &quot;specialty,&quot; is common to signed written agreements not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, &quot;Signed, sealed and delivered,&quot; or even merely &quot;Executed as a deed&quot;) is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the contract between the parties to the deed. ''Poll'' is an [[Archaism|archaic]] legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an ''indenture'', so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet for each party, then irregularly torn or &quot;indented&quot; so that each party had a document with a unique tear, to discourage [[forgery]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Documentary film''' is a broad category of cinematic expression united by the intent to remain factual or [[non-fiction]]al.
==History==
===Pre-1900===
The French used the term to refer to any non-fiction including travelogues and instructional videos. The earliest &quot;moving pictures&quot; were by definition documentary.  They were single shots, moments captured on film, whether of a train entering a station, a boat docking, or a factory of people getting off work.  Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event.  These short films were called actuality films. Very little storytelling took place before the turn of the century, due mostly to technological limitations: cameras could hold only very small amounts of film; many of the first films are a minute or less in length.

===Romanticism===
[[Image:Nanook of the north.jpg|thumb|''Nanook of the North'' movie poster.]]
With [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in [[1922]], documentary film embraced [[romanticism]]; Flaherty went on to film a number of heavily staged romantic films, usually showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then (for instance, in ''Nanook of the North'' Flaherty does not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but has them use a harpoon instead, putting themselves in considerable danger).    

Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless [[igloo]] for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.

===Newsreel tradition=== 
The [[newsreel]] tradition is an important tradition in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually reenactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early [[20th century]] was staged -- the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and reenact scenes to film them.  [[Dziga Vertov]] was involved with the Russian ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' newsreel series (&quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; means literally, &quot;film-truth,&quot; a term that was later translated literally into the French [[cinéma vérité]]).  [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series was a newsreel series in the [[United States]], commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war.

===Realist tradition===
The continental, or realist, tradition focused on man within man-made environments, and included the so-called &quot;city symphony&quot; films such as ''[[Berlin, Symphony of a City]]'', ''[[Rien que les Heures]]'', and ''[[Man with the Movie Camera]]''.  These films tended to feature people as products of their environment, and leaned towards the impersonal or avant-garde.

===Propagandist tradition===
[[Image:Triumph018.jpg|thumb|[[Leni Reifenstahl]] filming ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' in [[Nuremburg]] in [[1934]].]]

The propagandist tradition consisted of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point.  One of the most notorious [[propaganda film]]s is [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.  ''Why We Fight'' was explicitly contracted as a propaganda newsreel series in response to this, covering different aspects of [[World War II]], and had the daunting task of persuading the US public to go to war.  The series has been selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]]. In Britain, [[Humphrey Jennings]] succeeded in blending propaganda with a poetic approach to documentary.

===J. Grierson and D. Vertov===
In the [[1930s]], documentarian and film critic [[John Grierson]] argued in his essay ''First Principles of Documentary'' that Robert Flaherty's film ''[[Moana]]'' had &quot;documentary value,&quot; and put forward a number of principles of documentary.  These principles were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the &quot;original&quot; actor and &quot;original&quot; scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials &quot;thus taken from the raw&quot; can be more real than the acted article.  In this regard, Grierson's views align with Dziga Vertov's contempt for dramatic fiction as &quot;bourgeois excess,&quot; though with considerably more subtlety.  Grierson's definition of documentary as &quot;creative treatment of actuality&quot; has gained some acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.

In his essays, Vertov argued for presenting &quot;life as it is&quot; (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and &quot;life caught unawares&quot; (life provoked or surprised by the camera).  Cinema verite borrows from both [[Italian neorealism]]'s penchant for shooting non-actors on location, and the [[French New Wave]]'s use of largely unscripted action and improvised dialogue; the filmmakers took advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfold.

===Cinéma vérité===
The films ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (directed by [[Barbara Kopple]]), ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' ([[D. A. Pennebaker]]), ''[[Lonely Boy]]'' ([[Wolf Koenig]] and [[Roman Kroitor]]) and ''[[Chronicle of a Summer]]'' ([[Jean Rouch]]) are all considered [[cinéma vérité]]. Although sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité ([[Jean Rouch]]) and the North American &quot;[[Direct Cinema]]&quot;, pioneered among others by French Canadian [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Brault Michel Brault], [[Pierre Perrault]], [[Richard Leacock]], [[Frederick Wiseman]] and [[Albert and David Maysles]]. The directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement, Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choosing non-involvement, and Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favoring direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.
The fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving camera (not a tripod) to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the shooting ratio (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80:1. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement, Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, Susan Froemke, and Ellen Hovde are often overlooked, but their input to the film so vital that they were often given co-director credits. Famous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include ''Showman'', ''Salesman'', ''The Children Were Watching'', ''Primary'', ''Behind a Presidential Crisis'', and ''Grey Gardens''.

===The '60s and '70s===
In the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against [[neocolonialism]] and [[capitalism]] in general, especially in [[Latin America]], but also in the then turbulent [[Quebec]] society. ''La Hora de los hornos'' (''[[The Hour of the Furnaces]]'', from 1968), directed by [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Fernando E. Solanas]], influenced a whole generation of filmmakers.

===Compilation films===
The creation of compilation films is not a recent development in the field of documentary. It was pioneered in 1927 by [[Esfir Schub]] with'' The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty''. More recent examples include  ''Point of Order'' (1964),directed by [[Emile de Antonio]] about the McCarthy hearings and ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'' which is made entirely out of found footage which various agencies of the U.S. government made about the safety of nuclear radiation (e.g., telling troops at one point that it's safe to be irradiated as long as they keep their eyes and mouths shut).  Meanwhile ''[[The Last Cigarette]]'' combines the testimony of various [[tobacco]] company executives before the U.S. Congress with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.

Non-fiction film can also be used to produce the more subjective reflective attitude characteristic of essays. Important essay film makers include [[Chris Marker]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Raoul Peck]] and [[Harun Farocki]].

===Modern documentaries===
[[Image:Movie_poster_fahrenheit_9-11.jpg|thumb|''Fahrenheit 9/11'' movie poster.]]
[[Box office]] analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' being the most successful examples.  Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets.  This has made them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.

The nature of documentary films has changed in the past 20 years from the cinema verité tradition.  Landmark films such as ''[[The Thin Blue Line]]'' by [[Errol Morris]], which incorporated stylized re-enactments, and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger and Me]]'', which made claims of chronology that were later questioned by critics such as [[Pauline Kael]], placed far more overt interpretive control in the hands of the director.  Indeed, the commercial success of the documentaries mentioned above may owe something to this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics usually refer to these works as &quot;[[mondo films]]&quot;.  However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Robert Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form.

The recent success of the documentary genre, and the advent of [[DVD]]s, has made documentaries financially viable even without a cinema release. There are now around thirty quality feature-length documentaries on notable photographers, for instance, a situation that would have seemed incredible twenty years ago. Documentaries are also being released only on the internet for those with [[broadband access]], notably ''[[Stolen Honor]]'' (2004) about [[John Kerry]].

Modern documentaries have a substantial overlap with other forms of television, with the development of so-called ''[[reality television]]'' that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged.

The ''making-of'' documentary shows how a [[Film|movie]] or a [[Computer and video games|computer game]] was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is usually closer to an advertisement than to classical documentary.

Modern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''''drama film''''' is a [[film]] that depends mostly on in-depth character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes.  In a good drama film, the audience are able to experience what other characters are feeling and identify with someone.  

This genre could be especially useful by challenging the ignorance from stereotypes or any other overly simplistic generalisations by bringing it down to a more personal and complex level.  As well, such movies could also be theraputic by showing how characters cope with their problems, challenges, or issues, and to the extent the viewer can identify with the characters with his or her own world.   

This film genre can be contrasted with an [[action film]] which relies on fast-paced action and develops characters sparsely.

'''''Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle''''' ('''DoTT''') is a graphical [[adventure game]], originally released in [[1993]], and published by [[LucasArts]]. It is the eighth game to use the [[SCUMM]] engine.

The game was released simultaneously on [[floppy disk]] and [[CD-ROM]], with the CD-ROM version featuring a full [[voiceover]] [[soundtrack]]. ''Day of the Tentacle'' was designed by [[Dave Grossman]] and [[Tim Schafer]].

==Storyline==
{{spoiler}}
''Day of the Tentacle'' begins five years after the events in ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''.  Of the seven playable characters in the first game, only Bernard Bernoulli, a stereotypical [[nerd]] character, makes a return appearance.  This time, Bernard has a starring role, as he leads his two new friends, Hoagie and Laverne, back to the Mansion.  One of Dr. Fred Edison's two creations, the Purple Tentacle, drinks radioactive waste from the Mansion, growing two stubby appendages for arms and an appetite for [[global domination]]. Bernard and friends plan to travel back in time, using Dr. Fred's  [[Port-a-john|Port-a-Potty]]-turned-[[time machine]]s (dubbed &quot;Chron-o-John&quot;s), to stop Purple from drinking the toxic waste in the first place.

Unfortunately, the cheap imitation diamond in Dr. Fred's time machine fails, leaving Hoagie 200 years in the past (where he can meet such famous historical figures as [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]), Laverne 200 years in the future (where Purple Tentacle's dreams for domination have come true) and Bernard still in the present. Bernard, with the assistance of budding rock star Green Tentacle, has to find a non-imitation diamond in order to make the time machine functional once more, and Hoagie and Laverne both have to get back to their time machines and connect them to a power source, in order to team up again and finally defeat Purple Tentacle. The game uses the three time streams effectively, with several puzzles depending on actions in one era affecting the other eras.

One of the most notable features of ''Day of the Tentacle'' is that it includes the entire original ''Maniac Mansion'' as a game-within-a-game. To play it, simply use Weird Ed's computer (in the Macintosh version of the game, the computer needs to be used five times in a row).

The game has several puzzles that require the player to perform actions in the past that affect the future. For example, a vacuum cleaner advertisment flyer can be inserted into the suggestion box for the American constitution; consequently a clause is added to the constitution that every American should have a vacuum cleaner in their basement. And consequently, in the future when vacuum cleaners have actually been ''invented'', you can find one and use it.

==Historical interaction==
{{spoiler}}
One of the unique aspects of ''Day of the Tentacle'''s plot is that it gives the game player the opportunity to interact with computer-generated versions of several important historical figures from [[Colonial America]], namely [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Hancock]] and [[Betsy Ross]].  Their personality traits are exaggerated for comic effect.  Some of the more entertaining puzzles/challenges of the game involve these characters. Their descendants (or at least [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s that look like them) can be seen in the other ages (present time and future time). 
[[Image:Dottscreen.png|thumb|left|250px|''Day of the Tentacle'' characters (l to r) John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, Hoagie and George Washington]]
In one sequence, Hoagie must give an exploding cigar to Washington in order to replace his famous [[false teeth]] with chattering novelty mechanical dentures, while in another he gives a drawing of a tentacle to Ross, who sews it into the [[American flag]].

By painting the fruits of a [[Kumquat]] tree red, the player forces Washington to chop down the created &quot;Cherry&quot; tree, also a myth concerning Washington's youth.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Dott-screenshot.png|right|thumb|200px|The Purple Tentacle, seen here shortly after his mutation in the opening cinematic, is the main antagonist in ''Day of the Tentacle''.]]
''Day of the Tentacle'' follows the [[point-and-click]] two-dimensional [[adventure game]] formula, first established by the original ''Maniac Mansion''.  Players direct the controllable characters around the game world by clicking with the computer mouse.  To interact with the game world, players choose from a set of commands arrayed on the screen and then on an object in the world. This was the last SCUMM game to use the original interface of having the bottom half of the screen being taken up by a verb selection and inventory; starting with the next game to use the SCUMM engine, [[Sam and Max Hit the Road]], the engine was modified to scroll through a more concise list of verbs with the right mouse button and having the inventory on a separate screen. In ''Day of the Tentacle'', the player can switch between any one of the three playable characters at any time.  The three protagonists can also share inventory items amongst themselves (at least, those items that can be stowed in a toilet), a feature that plays into many of the game's puzzles.

In ''Maniac Mansion'', the playable characters can be killed by various sequences of events.  LucasArts adopted a different philosophy towards its adventure games in 1990, beginning with ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.  Their philosophy was that the game should not punish the player for exploring the game world.  Accordingly, in most of the adventure games released by LucasArts after ''Monkey Island'' (including ''Day of the Tentacle''), the player character(s) cannot die (there is one exceptional sequence in which the player character of ''Monkey Island'' could perish; see that game's article for more information).

==Sequels==
There have been a few fan groups in Germany who have started developing fan-games, but [[as of 2005]], none of them are complete.  As of this time, LucasArts seems to be very unreceptive to the idea of making any more adventure games or allowing others to commercially develop their old licenses.

[[Image:Douglasadams.jpg|thumb|200px|Douglas Noël Adams in an undated publicity photograph by [[Jill Furmanovsky]]. {{ref|PromoPhoto}} ]] 
'''Douglas Noël Adams''' ([[March 11]], [[1952]] &amp;ndash; [[May 11]], [[2001]]), known to some fans as ''Bop Ad'' (after his illegible signature), or by his initials &quot;DNA&quot;, was a [[cult figure|cult]] [[United Kingdom|British]] comic [[radio drama|radio dramatist]], amateur musician and [[author]], most notably of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series (''HHGG'' or ''H2G2''). ''Hitchhiker's'' began on radio, and developed into a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|&quot;trilogy&quot; of five books]] (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], a [[towel]], a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]] and a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]] that was completed after Adams's death.

In addition to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of science fiction staple ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and served the series as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|Dirk Gently]]'' novels, and co-author credits on two ''[[Meaning of Liff|Liff]]'' books and ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was realized by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by [[Terry Jones]]. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002. His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], and other &quot;techno gizmos.&quot; He was a keen technologist, using such inventions as [[e-mail]] and [[Usenet]] before they became widely popular, or even widely known.

Adams was a self-described &quot;radical [[atheist]]&quot;. Towards the end of his life, he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.  Since his death at the age of 49, he is still widely revered in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[fandom]] circles.

==Early life==
&lt;!-- Please leave this section heading as is, for the chronology of events. Adams's own family (wife and daughter) are discussed later. --&gt;
			
Douglas Adams was born to Janet (Donovan) Adams (now Janet Thrift) and Christopher Douglas Adams in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. His parents had one other child together, Susan, who was born in March 1955. His parents separated and divorced in 1957, and Douglas, Susan, and Janet moved in with Janet's parents, the Donovans, in [[Brentwood, Essex]]. Douglas's grandmother kept her house as an official [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] refuge for hurt animals, which &quot;exacerbated young Douglas's hayfever and asthma.&quot; {{ref|2005Webb01}}

Christopher Adams remarried in July 1960, to Mary Judith Stewart (born Judith Robertson). From this marriage, Douglas Adams had a half-sister, Heather. Janet remarried in 1964, to a veterinarian, Ron Thrift, providing two more half-siblings to Douglas: Jane and James Thrift.

==Education and early works==
Adams first attended Primrose Hill Primary School in [[Brentwood, Essex]]. He took the exams and interviewed for [[Brentwood School (Brentwood, England)|Brentwood School]] at age six, and attended the Preparatory School from 1959 to 1964, then the main school till 1970. He was in the top stream, and specialised in the arts in the sixth form, after which he stayed an extra term in a special seventh form class, customary in the school for those preparing for Oxbridge entrance exams. 

While at the prep school, he had an English class, taught by Frank Halford, where Halford awarded Adams the only ten out of ten of his entire teaching career for a creative writing exercise. Adams remembered this for the rest of his life, especially when facing writer's block. Some of Adams's earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on the school's Photography Club in ''The Brentwoodian'' (in 1962) or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'' (edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]]). Adams also had a letter and short story published nationally in the UK in the boys' magazine ''The Eagle'' in 1965. He met [[Griff Rhys Jones]], who was in the year below, at the school, and was in the same class as &quot;Stuckist&quot; artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]; all three appeared together in a production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1968. He was six feet tall (1.83 m) by the time he was 12, and he stopped growing only at 6'5&quot; (1.96 m). 

On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that mixed the [[Beatles]] with [[William Blake]], he was awarded a place at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to read [[English literature|English]], entering in 1971. {{ref|ODNB}} Adams attempted early on to get into the [[Footlights]] Dramatic Club, with which several other names in British Comedy had been affiliated. He was, however, turned down, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and [[Martin Smith]], forming a group called &quot;Adams-Smith-Adams.&quot; Later, on another attempt to join Footlights, Douglas Adams was encouraged by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] and Adams found himself working with Rhys Jones, among others. In 1974, Adams graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English literature]].

Some of his early work appeared on [[BBC2]] (television) in 1974, in an edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' from Cambridge, that year. A version of the same revue performed live in [[London]]'s [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being &quot;discovered&quot; by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, and Adams earned a writing credit in one episode (episode 45: &quot;Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Liberal Party&quot;) of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill out numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment (a joke he later incorporated into the [[Vogon]]s' obsession with paperwork). Adams also contributed to a sketch on the album for ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

[[Image:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Douglas Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb in episode 42.]]

Douglas also had two &quot;blink and you miss them&quot; appearances in the fourth series of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''. At the beginning of Episode 42, &quot;The Light Entertainment War,&quot; Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. At the beginning of Episode 44, &quot;Mr Neutron,&quot; Adams is dressed in a &quot;pepperpot&quot; outfit and loads a missile onto a cart, driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling out for scrap metal (&quot;Any old iron...&quot;). The two episodes were first broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]].''

Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''. He also co-wrote, again with Graham Chapman, the [[20 February]] [[1977]] episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the [[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]] television comedy series.

As Adams had difficulty selling his jokes and stories, he took a series of &quot;odd jobs&quot; in order to have some income. A biography from an early edition of one of the ''HHGG'' novels provides the following description of his early career:
:After graduation he spent several years contributing material to radio and television shows as well as writing, performing, and sometimes directing [[revue| stage revues]] in [[London]], Cambridge and at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. He has also worked at various times as a [[hospital]] porter, [[barn]] builder, [[chicken]] shed cleaner, [[bodyguard]], [[radio producer]] and [[script editor]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.
Adams held the job as a bodyguard in the mid-1970s. He was employed by an Arab family, which had made its fortune in oil (and were from [[Qatar]], according to the ''Encyclopedia Britannica''). {{ref|EB_Adams}} He had a couple of favourite anecdotes about the job: one story related that the family once ordered one of everything from a hotel's menu, tried all of the dishes, and sent out for hamburgers. Another story had to do with a prostitute, sent to the floor Adams was guarding one evening. They acknowledged each other as she entered, and an hour later, when she left, she is said to have remarked, &quot;At least you can read while you're on the job.&quot; {{ref|Webb2005_93}}

[[Image:Remarkable Fidgety River Title.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card from the ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'' episode &quot;The Remarkable Fidgety River&quot;, written by Douglas Adams and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]].]]

In 1979, Adams and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] wrote the scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': &quot;The Remarkable Fidgety River&quot; and &quot;The Great Disappearing Mystery&quot; (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; radio series (Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth (a.k.a. Episodes Five and Six, ''see explanation below'')), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''. Lloyd and Adams also collaborated on an SF movie comedy project based on ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', which would have starred [[John Cleese]] as the UN Secretary General, and had a race of aliens beating humans in athletic competitions, but the humans winning in all of the &quot;absurd&quot; record categories. This latter project never proceeded past a treatment.

After the first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a pantomime called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''. He left the position after six months to become the script editor for [[Doctor Who]].

==''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''==
[[Image:H2G2 UK front cover.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Front cover, designed by [[Hipgnosis]], of the original UK paperback edition of the novel ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.]]

''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in Neil Gaiman's book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could potentially be used in the series. 

According to Adams, the idea for the title ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] (though he joked that the [[BBC]] would instead claim it was [[Spain]] &quot;because it's easier to spell&quot; {{ref|Adams2003_10}}), gazing at the stars. He had been wandering the countryside while carrying a book called the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'' when he ran into a town where, as he humorously describes, everyone was either &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; or only spoke languages he couldn't. After wandering around and drinking for a while, he went to sleep in the middle of a field and was inspired by his inability to communicate with the townspeople. He later said that due to his constantly retelling this story of inspiration, he no longer had any memory of the moment of inspiration itself, and only remembered his retellings of that moment. A postscript to M. J. Simpson's biography of Adams, ''Hitchhiker'', provides evidence that the story was in fact a fabrication and that Adams had conceived the idea some time ''after'' his trip around Europe.

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''. {{ref|Webb2005_120}} However, very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series itself was based on the first six radio episodes, but sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written. 

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the [[Christmas]] Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of [[21 January]] - [[25 January]] [[1980]]. 

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that only got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a [[hotel]] suite with his [[editor]] for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'' was completed. {{ref|2004bookslut}} He was quoted as saying, &quot;I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.&quot; {{ref|HitchhikerUS236}}

[[Image:DNA with H2G2 towel.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Douglas Adams with an officially licensed ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' towel on his left shoulder.]]

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[computer game]], and a photo illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardcover edition).{{ref|42PuzzleCovers}} Adams also began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a movie in 1980, making several trips to [[Los Angeles, California]], and working with a number of Hollywood studios and potential producers. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project green-lit with Disney. The screenplay finally got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], was green-lit in September 2003, and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting movie]] was released in 2005.

Radio Producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams in 1993 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series. They also vaguely discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book &quot;trilogy.&quot; As well as the movie, this project was only realized after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and is now available on audio CD. Douglas Adams himself can be heard playing the part of Agrajag. ''So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June of 2005, and subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, &quot;more upbeat&quot; ending) concluded with, &quot;The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author.&quot; {{ref|ScriptBookTwo356}}

==''Doctor Who''==
[[Image:The Pirate Planet Writers Credit.jpg|thumb|200px|Douglas Adams's credit from the opening titles of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Pirate Planet]]''.]]
Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen,&quot; which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe, and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who serials|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as the Doctor:

* ''The Pirate Planet'' (the second serial in the &quot;[[The Key to Time|Key To Time]]&quot; arc, in [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 16 (1978-79)|Season 16]])
* ''[[City of Death]]'' (with producer [[Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher]]. It was transmitted under the pseudonym &quot;[[David Agnew]]&quot;)
* ''[[Shada]]'' (only partially filmed and not broadcast due to industrial disputes)

Adams was also known to allow [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references#Hitchhiker's references in Doctor Who|in-jokes]] from ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' to appear in the ''Doctor Who'' stories he wrote and other stories on which he served as Script Editor. Conversely, at least one reference to ''Doctor Who'' was worked into a ''Hitchhiker's'' novel. In ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', two characters travel in time and land on the pitch at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. The reaction of the radio commentators to their sudden appearance is very similar to a scene in the eighth episode of the 1965-66 story ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which has [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s [[TARDIS]] [[Materialization (science fiction)|materialise]] on the pitch at Lord's, with the reactions of the match's commentators.

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams's later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]]. [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[BBCi]] website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on [[10 December]] [[2005]].

Adams is credited with introducing a fan of his, the zoologist [[Richard Dawkins]], to Dawkins' future wife, [[Lalla Ward]], who had played the part of [[Romana]] in Doctor Who.

When he was at school, he wrote and performed a play called ''Doctor Which''.

==Music==
Adams played the left-handed [[guitar]] and had a collection of twenty-four of these instruments when he died in 2001 (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied [[piano]] in the 1960s with the same instructor who taught [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who later played in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004-2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). {{ref|Webb2005_49}} [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] all had great influence on Adams's work.

===Pink Floyd===
Adams included a direct reference to [[Pink Floyd]] in the original radio version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which he describes the main characters surveying the landscape of an alien planet while Marvin, their android companion, hums Pink Floyd's &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot;. See also [[Pink Floyd trivia]] or [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)#Trivia|Hitchhiker's radio series trivia]].

Adams's official biography shares its name with the song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; by [[Pink Floyd]]. Adams was friendly with their guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on the occasion of his 42nd birthday (the number 42 having especial significance, being [[The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything]]), was invited to make a guest appearance at one of their 1994 concerts in [[London]], playing [[rhythm guitar]] on the songs &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot;. Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'' by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks. Gilmour also performed at Adams's Memorial Service.

Pink Floyd and their lavish stage shows were also the inspiration for the Adams-created fictional [[rock band]] &quot;[[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desiato|Disaster Area]]&quot;, described in the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' as not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. One element of Disaster Area's stage show was to send a space ship hurtling into a sun, probably inspired by the plane that would crash into the stage during some of Pink Floyd's live shows, usually at the end of &quot;On The Run&quot;. The 1968 Pink Floyd song “Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun” may also have influenced part of the ideas behind Disaster Area.

===Procol Harum===
Douglas Adams was a good friend with [[Gary Brooker]], the lead singer, pianist and songwriter of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Procol Harum]]. Adams is known to have invited Brooker to one of the many parties that Adams held at his house. On one such occasion Gary Brooker performed the full (4 verse) version of his hit song ''[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]''. Brooker also performed at Adams's Memorial Service.

Adams also appeared on stage with Brooker to perform ''In Held Twas in I'' at Redhill when the band's lyricist [[Keith Reid]] was not available. On several other occasions he had been known to introduce Procol Harum at their gigs. 

Adams also let it be known that while writing he would listen to music, and this would occasionally influence his work. On one occasion the title track from the Procol Harum album ''[[Grand Hotel (album)|Grand Hotel]]'' was playing when ''&quot;suddenly in the middle of the song there was this huge orchestral climax that came out of nowhere and didn't seem to be about anything. I kept wondering what was this huge thing happening in the background? And I eventually thought ... it sounds as if there ought to be some sort of floorshow going on. Something huge and extraordinary, like, well, like the end of the universe. And so that was where the idea for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe came from.&quot;'' {{ref|ProcolHarum}}

===Other musical links===
Adams made a number of links to music of the time in his books. For example, a [[mouse]] proposes that the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything is &quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot;, a line from [[Bob Dylan]]'s song ''[[Blowin' in the Wind]]''.

In ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', as the Heart of Gold approaches [[Magrathea]] and the ship's computer is otherwise occupied, Eddie, the ship's computer personality, sings ''[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]'' in the background, a [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] hit from the musical [[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]].

''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'' is dedicated to the 1980 Paul Simon soundtrack album [[One Trick Pony]].  Adams says he played it &quot;incessantly&quot; while writing the book.

In ''So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish'', Arthur Dent listens to a [[Dire Straits]] LP and Adams goes on to pay tribute to their lead guitarist, [[Mark Knopfler]]. Adams later revealed that the particular song to which he refers in the book&amp;mdash;although never by name&amp;mdash;is ''Tunnel of Love'', from the ''Making Movies'' album.

In ''Mostly Harmless'', [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is discovered playing in a diner attended by [[Ford Prefect]] and [[Arthur Dent]], where he is simply known as &quot;The King&quot;.

Besides modern rock music, Douglas Adams was a great admirer of the work of [[JS Bach]], which provides a minor plot element in ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''.

Adams was also a major fan of [[The Beatles]]. He makes a reference to [[Paul McCartney]] in ''Life, The Universe, and Everything'' and quotes lyrics and titles from songs by The Beatles in ''Mostly Harmless'' and ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''.

Adams also does this at least once in ''The Salmon of Doubt''. In Chapter 3 there is a conversation between Kate and Dirk, which includes the following exchange:
:&quot;So?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.&quot;

Taken together, these two lines form a quotation from &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album.

==Computer games and projects==
[[Image:Starship Titanic box art.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Front cover of the box from the original U.S. Windows 95 CD-ROM release of ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', by Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive.]]

Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' together with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a weeklong brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game, ''[[Labyrinth (game)|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' (also by Infocom, but not based on any book). Adams was also responsible for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was published in 1999 by [[Simon and Schuster]]. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled ''Douglas Adams’s Starship Titanic'', since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[H2G2|h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project which was the most prominent attempt at making The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy a reality.

In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a [[television documentary]] programme ''[[Hyperland]]'' {{ref|Hyperland_IMDb}} also featuring [[Tom Baker]] as a &quot;software agent&quot; (similar to the &quot;Assistants&quot; used in several versions of [[Microsoft Office]], derived from their failed &quot;Bob&quot; program), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], which was essentially about the use of [[hypertext]]. Although Adams didn't ''invent'' hypertext, he was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of it, and his influence should not be underestimated. This was the same year that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] used the idea of hypertext in his [[HTML]].

==Dirk Gently==
[[Image:Dirk Gently UK front cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Front cover of the original UK hardcover edition of ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''.]]

In between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as &quot;a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics.&quot; {{ref|Gaiman2003_169}} It received many rave reviews from American newspapers upon its publication in the USA. Adams borrowed a few ideas from two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories he had worked on: ''[[City of Death]]'' and ''[[Shada]]''. 

A sequel novel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' Reviewers, however, were not as generous with praise with the second volume as they had been with the first. After the obligatory book tours, Adams was off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

==Personal beliefs==
===Religion===
Adams was a self-declared &quot;radical [[atheist]]&quot;, though he used the term for emphasis, so that he would not be asked if he in fact meant [[agnostic]]. He stated in an interview with American Atheists {{ref|AmAtheists}} that this was easier and conveyed the fact that he really meant it, had thought about it a great deal, and that it was an opinion he held seriously. He was convinced that there is no [[God]], having never seen one shred of [[evidence]] to convince him otherwise, and devoted himself instead to secular causes like [[environmentalism]].

===Environmentalism and Animal Rights===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of a number of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[kakapo]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In [[1992]], this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audio book]], [[eBook]] and picture slide show a decade before such things became fashionable. His environmental activism is also recounted in the book ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in a short account of a hike he once made across the plains of [[Africa]] while wearing a rhino suit.  

Since 2003, the British charity organization ''[[Save the Rhino]]'' (one of several similar charities supported by Adams) have held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns{{ref|DNAML}}.  The lectures in the series are:

* [[2003]] [[Richard Dawkins]] — ''Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science''
* [[2004]] [[Robert Swan]] — on walking across [[Antarctica]] and his environmental work there 
* [[2005]] [[Mark Carwardine]] — ''Last Chance to See… Just a bit more'' 
* [[2006]] [[Robert Winston]] — ''Is the Human an Endangered Species?''

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''. {{ref|TGAP}} This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]] launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human or nonhuman.

===Technology===
Adams was a serious fan of technology. Though he did not buy his first [[word processor]] until 1982, he had considered one as early as 1979. He was quoted as saying that until 1982, he had difficulties with &quot;the impenetrable barrier of jargon. Words were flying backwards and forwards without concepts riding on their backs.&quot; In 1982, his first purchase was a 'Nexus'. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went out to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow-100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] 100. {{ref|Simpson2003_184-5}} In ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the Northern White Rhinoceros. {{ref|LCtC_59}}

Adams's posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features multiple articles written by Douglas on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''MacUser'' magazine, and in ''The Independent on Sunday'' newspaper. In these, Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that his love affair with the [[Apple Macintosh]] first began after seeing one at Infocom's headquarters in Massachusetts in 1983 (though that was actually very likely an [[Apple Lisa]]). {{ref|Adams2002_90-1}}

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. Adams was also an &quot;Apple Master,&quot; one of several celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (other Apple Masters included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video can still be seen on Adams's [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams even installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework. {{ref|AdamsForum}} Adams can also be seen in the ''Omnibus'' tribute included with the Region One/NTSC DVD release of the TV adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' using Mac OS X (version 10.0.x) on his [[PowerBook]] G3.

Adams used e-mail extensively from the technology's infancy, adopting a very early version of e-mail to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] during the pair's collaboration on Infocom's version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup: alt.fan.douglas-adams. {{ref|GoogleAFDA1}} Many of his posts are now archived through [[Google]]. Challenges to the authenticity of his identity later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s, Adams had an affair with married novelist [[Sally Emerson]], to whom he dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]''. Emerson returned to her husband after splitting with Adams in 1981, and Adams was soon afterward introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the &quot;lady barrister&quot; mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s (&quot;He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh&quot;). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation to make ''Hitchhiker'' into a Hollywood movie. When the deal fell through, they moved to London, and after several separations and an aborted engagement, they were married on [[25 November]] [[1991]]. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on [[22 June]] [[1994]], in the year that Adams turned [[42 (number)#In pop culture|42]]. In 1999, the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until Adams's death. Following his funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London, where they currently reside. {{ref|Webb2005_ch10}}

==Adams's death==
[[Image:The_Salmon_of_Doubt_Macmillan_front.jpg|thumb|175px|The front cover of the UK first hardcover edition of ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''.]]

Adams died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 49 on Friday 11th May 2001, while working out at a private [[gym]] in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], [[California]]. He is survived by his wife Jane and daughter Polly. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north [[London]].

In May 2002, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many short stories, essays, and letters, and [[eulogy|eulogies]] from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf]] (in the U.S. edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the U.S. paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his long-awaited but unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was to be a new [[Dirk Gently]] and/or ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|HHGG]]'' novel, or neither.

Other events after Adams's death included the completion of ''[[Shada]]'', radio dramatizations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of the film adaptation of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.

==Biographies==
His [[official biography]], ''Wish You Were Here'', by [[Nick Webb (author)|Nick Webb]], was published on [[6 October]] [[2003]] (ISBN 0755311558). {{ref|2003WebbBio}}

Another biography is ''[[Hitchhiker: a Biography of Douglas Adams (book)|Hitchhiker: a Biography of Douglas Adams]]'' (2003) by M. J. Simpson, with a [[foreword]] (in the [[UK]] edition) by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] (ISBN 0340824883). The [[United States|American]] edition contains a foreword by [[Neil Gaiman]] (ISBN 1932112170).

Upon the mutual discovery that Webb and Simpson were both working on new posthumous biographies, the two authors agreed that the former would focus on Adams's life and personality, and the latter on his work.

The BBC produced a tribute as part of their TV series Omnibus. It was first broadcast on BBC 2 on [[4 August]] [[2001]], presented by [[Kirsty Wark]]. The programme included interviews with [[Stephen Fry]], [[Clive Anderson]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and John Lloyd, among others. A copy is included with the Region One DVD release of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' TV series. 

A movie documentary, ''Life, The Universe and Douglas Adams'', was released in 2002, directed and produced by Rick Mueller and Joel Greengrass. Archive footage of Adams is generously included, as well as interviews with Adams's friends, colleagues and family. This documentary was narrated by [[Neil Gaiman]] and is available on VHS tape. {{ref|2002Video}}

'''Drum and bass''' (commonly abbreviated '''dnb''') is a type of [[electronic dance music]] also known as '''jungle'''. 

It began as an offshoot of the [[United Kingdom]] [[breakbeat hardcore]] and [[rave]] scene and came into existence in the early 1990s.  Over the first decade of its existence, drum and bass saw many permutations in style, incorporating everything from [[reggae]] and [[jazz]] to [[techno]] and [[trance]]. Today it is usually heard in [[nightclubs]] and its most recognizable features include a heavy emphasis on fast tempo drums in addition to loud intricate [[bassline]]s.

==History==
===Beginnings in the UK===
Drum and bass has its origins in breakbeat hardcore, a part of the UK rave scene.  Hardcore DJ typically played their records at fast tempos, and breakbeat hardcore emphasised breakbeats over the [[4-to-the-floor]] beat structure common to [[house music]].  Breakbeat harcore records  (commonly called 'tunes' within the community) Lennie De Ice's &quot;We are I.E&quot; ([[1991]]) and LTJ Bukem's ''Demon's Theme'' (1991) are generally credited [http://www.discogs.com/release/156749] as being among the first to have a recognizable drum and bass sound.  

Most hardcore tracks at the time were extremely light and upbeat; the most extreme example of this was the so called &quot;toy-town&quot; track such as Smart E's' ''Sesame's Treat'' which features the children's show ''[[Sesame Street]]'' theme song.  This style of hardcore would many years later be known as [[happy hardcore]].

In response to these lighter tracks, some producers started focusing on darker, more aggressive sounds; this style became known as [[darkcore]].  Strange noises and effects, syncopated rhythms made from rearranged funk [[breaks]] and loud bass lines defined the genre.  Examples of darkcore include [[Goldie]]'s '''Terminator''' (1992) and Nasty Habits' (aka [[Doc Scott]]) ''Here Comes the Drumz'' (1992).    

This darker, more aggressive sound appealed to many in the [[dancehall]] and raggae communities.  Both darkcore and dancehall shared an emphasis on rhythm and bass, and the tempos were well suited to be mixed together.  Soon many elements of dancehall raggae were being incorporated into the hardcore sound.

Whilst it has been suggested that it was the dancehall-aware black youth of Britain who fueled the drum and bass scene in the early days, this is not entirely true as there was substanial white following in northern British cities. The drum and bass [[subculture]] today has retained this racial diversity.  

The influence of Jamaican sound-system culture can be found in the use of basslines and remixing techniques derived from [[Dub]] and [[Reggae]] music, alongside the fast breakbeats and samples derived from urban musics such as [[hip-hop]], [[Funk]], [[jazz]], and [[r&amp;b]] alongside many production techniques borrowed from early electronic music such as [[house]], and [[techno]].

As the genre aged, the use of sampled funk breakbeats became increasingly complex (most notably and wide spread is the [[Amen break]] taken from a b-side funk track &quot;Amen, My Brother&quot; by the Winston Brothers) producers began cutting apart loops and using the component drum sounds to create new rhythms.  To match the complex drum lines, basslines which had less in common with the simple patterns of house and techno music than with the complex phrasings of dub and hip-hop began to be used.  Gradually, the bass and drum elements began to dominate to the music and -- combined with the liberal use of 32nd notes and abstract time signatures -- drum and bass became incompatible with house and techno and began to develop its own separate identity.  This sonic identity became highly-distinctive for both the depth of its bass and the increasingly-complex, rapid-fire breakbeat percussion.  Vastly different rhythmic patterns were distinctively being used, as well as new types of sampling, synthesis and effects processing techiniques, resulting in a greater focus on the intricacies of sampling/synthesis production and rhythm. This notably included early use of the [[Time stretching]] effect which was often used on percussion or vocal samples. As the influences of reggae and dub became more prominent, the sound of drum and bass began to take on an urban sound which was heavily influenced by ragga and dancehall music as well as hip-hop, often incorporating the distinctive vocal styles of these musical genres.  This raggae/dancehall influenced sound is most commonly associated with the term jungle.

However, as the early nineties saw drum and bass break out from its underground roots and begin to win popularity with the general British public, many producers attempted to expand the influences of the music beyond the domination of ragga-based sounds. By 1995, a counter movement to the ragga style was emerging, dubbed &quot;[[intelligent drum and bass|intelligent]]&quot; drum and bass by the music press, and embodied by producers such as [[LTJ Bukem]] and his [[Good Looking Organisation|Good Looking]] label. Some say that the move to intelligent drum and bass was a conscious and concerted reaction by top DJs and producers against a culture that was becoming tinged with &quot;gangsta&quot; and violent elements, and stereotyped with the recognizable production techniques of the ragga-influenced producers.  Intelligent drum and bass maintained the uptempo breakbeat percussion, but focused on more atmospheric sounds and warm, deep basslines over vocals or samples which often originated from [[Soul music|Soul]] or [[Jazz]] music.  From this period on, drum and bass would maintain the unity of a relatively-small musical culture, but one characterised by a competing group of stylistic influences.  Although many DJs have specialised in distinctive sub-genres within jungle and drum and bass, the majority of artists within the genre remain connected via record labels, events and radio shows. 

Jungle being a specific musical culture, has also resulted in the appearance of [[junglist]] [[subculture]], which, while not nearly as distinctive, alienated, ideological or obvious as other youth subcultures, and having many similarities with hip-hop styles and behaviour, does function distinctively within the drum &amp; bass listening community.

====Early pioneers====
Pioneers such as Bizzy B, [[Remarc]], Krome &amp; Time, [[Technical Itch]], [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]], [[DJ Hype]], [[Grooverider]], [[L Double]], [[Andy C]], [[Roni Size]], [[DJ SS]], [[Brockie]], [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]], [[Ray Keith]], [[Kenny Ken]], [[Goldie]], [[Jonny Waines]], [[LTJ Bukem]], [[Omni Trio]] and other DJs quickly became the stars of the genre. Other early artists include [[A Guy Called Gerald]] (seminal track &quot;28 Gun Bad Boy&quot;) and [[4hero]] (&quot;Mr Kirk's Nightmare&quot;) who later developed own styles, leaving the drum and bass mainstream. However, many of the early producers and DJs still produce and play in today's scene, forming something of a jungle 'old guard'.

===Jungle to drum and bass===
The phrase &quot;drum and bass&quot; had been used for years previously in the London soul and funk pirate radio scenes (and was even a bit of a catchphrase for UK Radio 1's R&amp;B Guru [[Trevor Nelson]] in his pirate days, who used it to describe the deeper, rougher funk and &quot;rare groove&quot; sound that was popular in London at the time. A formal station ID jingle used on legendary London pirate [[Kiss 100|Kiss FM]] from the late 1980s would proclaim &quot;Drum and Bass style on Kiss&quot;). 

Since the term jungle was so closely related to the raggae influenced sound, DJs and producers who did not incorporate raggae elements began to adopt the term &quot;drum and bass&quot; to differentiate themselves and their musical styles.  The mid 1990s also saw a large splintering of the scene.  Each sub-genre would tend to be known by its name as opposed to either jungle or drum and bass, though today all sub-genres are usually grouped by the umbrella term ''drum and bass''.

As intelligent drum and bass gained in popularity, the [[ragga jungle]] sound became more stripped-down;  The complex chopped beats were dropped in favor of simplified rhythms featuring loud, aggressive-sounding snare drums.  This hard percussive style eventually became known as [[hardstep]].  Simultaneously, certain producers developed a more hiphop and funk influenced style known as [[jump-up]], which was exemplified by artists like Mickey Finn and [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]] (with their [[Urban Takeover]] label), and the releases on the [[Ganja Kru]]'s [[True Playaz]] label.  Outside these genres, which became the most popular styles, other artists pushed a smoother, dubby style of music which had more in common with the jazzy and soulful interests of intelligent drum and bass. Records in this style were often referred to as ''rollers''.  

Through 1996, hardstep and jump-up sounds were very popular in clubs and at raves, whereas intelligent drum and bass was pushing a sound which was considered more accessible to the home listener.  This resultied in the popularity of the style with mainstream music magazines, as CD album releases by [[4 Hero]] and [[Goldie]] were more readily-available than the underground dubplates which characterised the club-based styles.  Stylistically, drum and bass began to adopt an ever more diverse range of influences, crossbreeding with many other forms of dance music to produce a series of hybrid sounds.  In 1997, a sound which was influenced by the double-bass work of jazz musicians came to the forefront, producing a funky, accessible style which achieved mainstream success for artists such as [[Roni Size]] and [[Reprazent]].  The group's ''New Forms'' album won the UK's [[Mercury Prize]], and their innovative live band helped drum and bass to break out of the DJ circuit, winning acclaim for performances at music festivals and on television shows.

Around this time, drum and bass also sealed its popularity by winning a Friday night slot on [[Radio One]], the [[BBC]]'s flagship radio station. Initially presented by a revolving groups of jungle luminaries, hosted by [[MC Navigator]], the station eventually secured the presenting services of [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] and [[Grooverider]], two of the oldest and most-respected DJs in the scene.

===The birth of techstep===
As a lighter sound of drum and bass began to win over the musical mainstream, many producers continued to work on the other end of the spectrum, resulting in a series of releases which highlighted a dark, technical sound which drew more influence from [[techno music|Techno]] and the soundscapes of [[science fiction]] and [[anime]] films. This style was championed by the labels Emotif and [[No U-Turn]], and artists like Trace, [[Ed Rush]] and [[Optical (artist)|Optical]], and [[Dom and Roland]], and is commonly referred to as [[techstep]].  Techstep focused intensely on studio production and applied new techniques of sound generation and processing to older jungle appraoches. Self-consciously underground, and lacking the accessible influences of much other drum and bass, techstep is deeply atmospheric, often characterized by sinister or science-fiction themes, cold and complex percussion, and dark, distorted basslines.  

As the 1990s drew to a close, drum and bass withdrew from mainstream popularity and concentrated on sounds which were popular in clubs, rather than on mainstream radio.  Techstep came to dominate the drum and bass genre, with artists like [[Konflict]] and [[Bad Company (drum and bass artist)|Bad Company]] amongst the most visible.  As time went on, techstep was becoming more minimal, and increasingly dark in tone, and the funky, commercial appeal represented by Roni Size back in 1997 was waning.  However, 2000 saw an increasing movement to &quot;bring the fun back into drum and bass&quot;, heralded by the chart success enjoyed by singles from [[Andy C]] and [[Shimon]] (''Bodyrock'') and [[Shy FX]] and [[T Power]] (''Shake UR Body'').  In the clubs there was a new revival of rave-oriented sounds, as well as remixes of classic jungle tunes that capitalised on nostalgia and an interest in the origins of the music.  Many felt that jungle music had weathered the support, and then hostility, of the mainstream media (which had declared that &quot;Drum and bass is dead&quot; in the late 90s), and that the revival of chart success indicated that the style was more than a passing fashion.

===Since 2000===
Since the revival in popularity in 2000, the drum and bass scene has become very diverse, despite its relatively-small size, to the point where it is difficult to point to any one subgenre as the dominant style.  

In 2000, [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] began championing a form he called [[Liquid funk]], with a compilation release of the same name on his [[Creative Source]] label.  This was characterised by influences from [[disco]] and [[house (music)|house]], and widespread use of vocals.  Although slow to catch on at first, the style grew massively in popularity around 2002-2004, and by 2004 it was established as one of the biggest-selling subgenres in Drum &amp; Bass, with labels like [[Hospital Records]] and [[Soul:R]] and artists including [[High Contrast]], [[Calibre (artist)|Calibre]], [[Nu:Tone]], [[London Elektricity]] and [[Logistics (artist)|Logistics]] among its main proponents.

The decade also saw the revival of [[Jump-Up]].  Referred to as &quot;Nu Jump Up&quot;, or pejoratively as [[Clownstep]], this kept the sense of fun and the simplistic, bouncing basslines from the first generation of Jump Up, but with tougher, harder production values.  Prominent Nu Jump Up artists include [[Twisted Individual]], [[Generation Dub]], and [[DJ Hazard]].

Sales figures for 2004 suggest that liquid funk and Nu Jump Up combined probably account for a significant majority of the drum and bass market.

The period also saw the rise of a style known as [[Dubwise]], which returned drum and bass to its reggae-influenced roots, combined with modern production techniques which had advanced immeasurably since the early days of jungle.  Although the dub-influenced sound was not new, having long been championed by artists like [[Digital (artist)|Digital]] and [[Spirit (artist)|Spirit]], 2003-2004 saw a significant increase in its popularity and visibility, with new artists like [[Amit]] at the forefront.

Similarly, whilst there had long been a niche dedicated almost entirely to detailed drum programming and manipulation, championed by the likes of [[Paradox (artist)|Paradox]], the first half of this decade saw a revival and expansion in the subgenre known variously as [[Drumfunk]], &quot;Edits&quot;, or &quot;Choppage&quot;.  Major labels include [[Inperspective]] and the new wave of artists in this style include [[Fanu]], [[Breakage]], and [[Fracture and Nepture]].

The new millennium also saw a fresh wave of live drum and bass bands.  The likes of [[Reprazent]] and [[Red Snapper]] had performed live drum and bass during the 1990s, but the re-creation of [[London Elektricity]] as a live band focussed renewed interest on the idea, with acts like [[The Bays]], [[Keiretsu (band)|Keiretsu]], [[Deadsilence Syndicate]] and [[Ultra-Violet]] pursuing this avenue.

===The global scene in 2005===
The other major development largely occurring since the turn of the millennium is geographical: from UK-oriented beginnings, drum and bass has firmly established itself worldwide.  There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including the  [[USA]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]],  [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].  It is popular across [[Europe]], especially in [[Germany]] and in [[The Netherlands]], [[Baltics]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]. It is also popular in [[South America]]. Asia also has a drum and bass scene in places like Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong. São Paulo is sometimes called the drum and bass Ibiza. Brazilian drum and bass is sometimes called [[Sambass]], although in [[Venezuela]], artists have created Industrial forms of Drum and bass, and also [[Drill N Bass]] / [[intelligent dance music|IDM]], mixing also with Latin rhythms like [[Salsa music|Salsa]] or [[Latin Jazz]].ok

==Musicology of drum and bass==
There are many views of what constitutes &quot;real&quot; drum and bass as it has many scenes and styles within it, from heavy pounding bass lines to the relaxed vibes of [[Liquid funk]]. It has been compared with [[jazz]] where the listener can get very different sounding music all coming under the same [[music genre]], because like drum and bass, it is more of an approach, or a tradition, than a style.  As such, it is difficult to precisely define; however, the following key features may be observed: 

===Defining characteristics===
====Basslines====
Regarded by many as being the most important musical element in drum and bass. Basslines exist in many forms, but most notably they originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[Synthesizer|synthesizers]]. Live played basslines are rare. Sampled basslines are often taken from [[double bass]] recordings or from publicly available loops. Synthesized basslines are very common and have sprouted a classic sound known as the ''Hoover'' or ''Reese''.

====Tempo====
Drum and bass is usually between 160-180 BPM, in contrast to other forms of [[Breakbeat]] such as [[Nu skool breaks]] which maintain a slower pace at around 130-140 BPM.  A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass.  The earliest Old School rave and breakbeat-descended jungle was around 155-165 BPM, whilst [[21st Century]] material rarely falls below 170BPM, and often hits 180BPM.

====Importance of drum and bassline elements====
The name &quot;drum and bass&quot; should not lead to the assumption that tracks are constructed solely from these elements.  Nevertheless, they are by far and away the most critical features, and usually dominate the mix of a track.  The genre places great importance on deep [[sub-bass|sub-bass]] which is felt physically as much as it is heard, the &quot;bassline&quot;.  There has also been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bassline region, particularly within [[techstep]].

Despite the apparent simplicity, to the untrained ear, of drum &amp; bass productions, an inordinate amount of time is spent on preparing tracks by the more experienced producers.

In drum &amp; bass productions, the basslines are subjected to many and varied [[sound effect]]s, including standard techniques such as echo, flanger, chorus, over-drive, equalization, etc. and drum &amp; bass specific techniques such as the [[Reece Bass]]. These techniques are fully appreciated in a club or rave environment as only high grade bass speakers can fully reproduce the sounds of the eponymous bassline, whose frequences are sometimes lower than audible (they can however be felt on the body). This has led to the creation of of very large and intensely loud [[soundsystems]] by producers wishing to show off their tracks in a true high fidelity environment, such as [[Dillinja]]'s [[Valve Soundsystem]]. This however does not mean that the music cannot be appreciated on personal equipment.

The drum element, that is the syncopated break, is another that producers spend a very large amount of time on.  A drum fragment lasting seconds may often take a day or more to prepare, depending on the dedication of the producer, here [[Remarc]] is an acknowledged master.

===Context===
For the most part, drum and bass is a form of [[dance music]], mostly designed to be heard in [[Nightclub|clubs]].  It exhibits a [[full frequency response]] and physicality which often simply cannot be fully appreciated on home listening equipment. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music.  Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.

Drum and bass is often heard via a [[DJ]].  Because most tracks are designed to be mixed by a DJ, their structure typically reflects this, with intro and outro sections designed for a DJ to use while beat-matching, rather than being designed to be heard in entirety by the listener.  The DJ typically mixes between records so as not to lose the continuous beat. In addition, the DJ may employ hip-hop style &quot;[[scratching]]&quot;, &quot;double-drops&quot; (where two tracks are synchronized such that both tracks [[drop (music)|drop]] at the same time), and &quot;rewinds.&quot;  

Most mixing points begin or end with the &quot;[[drop (music)|drop]]&quot;.  The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and &quot;[[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]&quot;.  Sometimes the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tunes, though as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point, this could be considered lazier than blending the music where breakbeats play together. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will &quot;rewind&quot; or &quot;reload&quot; by spinning the record back and restarting it at the build.  This is a technique which can easily be overused as it breaks the continuity of a set. &quot;The drop&quot; is a key point from the point of view of the dancefloor, since the drumbreaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to dance. &quot;Jump up&quot; initially referred to the urge for those seated to dance at this point, though it came later to refer more specifically to a style of the music. A &quot;rewind&quot; would be popular here as the crowd could dance from the start of the record, and to the change in music they hadn't anticipated.

DJs are typically accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]]s, drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Reggae]]/[[Ragga]].

There are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The mix cd is a particularly popular form of release, with a big name dj/producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening.  Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.

===Relationship to other electronic music styles===
Recently, smaller scenes within the drum and bass community have developed and the scene as a whole has become much more fractured into specific sub-genres. Some major sub-genres of drum and bass include: 

* [[Breakcore]]
* [[Clownstep]] 
* [[Darkstep]]
* [[Drumfunk]] (or &quot;Choppage&quot;, &quot;Edits&quot;) 
* [[Dubstep]]
* [[Hardstep]]
* [[Intelligent drum and bass]] (or &quot;Atmospheric DnB&quot;)
* [[Jazzstep]] (&quot;Jazz and Bass&quot;)
* [[Jump-Up]] 
* [[Jungle music|Jungle]] 
* [[Liquid funk]]
* [[Neurofunk]]
* [[Techmospheric]] 
* [[Techstep]]
* [[Wobble]]

As with all attempts to classify and categorize music, the above should not be treated as gospel. Many producers release albums which touch into many of the above styles.

[[Drill and bass]], a sub-genre of [[Intelligent dance music]] (also known as &quot;IDM&quot;), popularized by [[Aphex Twin]], features many of the same types of rhythms used in drum and bass and is generally focused on complexity in programming and instrumentation.  Amongst its main proponents include [[Squarepusher]], [[Amon Tobin]] and [[Venetian Snares]], amongst others.

====Jungle vs Drum and Bass====
The difference between jungle and drum and bass is one of the most common debates within the community.  There is no universally accepted semantic distinction between the terms &quot;jungle&quot; and &quot;drum and bass&quot;.  Some associate &quot;jungle&quot; with older material from the first half of the 1990s (sometimes referred to as &quot;jungle techno&quot;), and see drum and bass as essentially succeeding jungle.   Others use jungle as a shorthand for ragga jungle, a specific sub-genre within the broader realm of drum and bass.  In the [[USA]], the combined term &quot;Jungle Drum and Bass&quot; (JDB) has some popularity, but is not widespread elsewhere.  Probably the widest held viewpoint is that the terms are simply synonymous and interchangeable: drum and bass is jungle, and jungle is drum and bass.

[[DJ Hype]]: &quot;At the end of the day I am a ambassador for Drum and Bass the world over and have been playing for 16 years under the name Hype... To most of you out there Drum and Bass will be a important part of your lives, but for me Drum and Bass/Jungle is my life and always has been... We all have a part to play and believe me when I say I am no fucking bandwagon jumper, just a hard working Hackney man doing this thing called Drum and Bass/Jungle&quot; [http://www.realplayaz.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?t=13411]

==Appearances in the mainstream==
Certain drum and bass releases have found mainstream popularity in their own right, almost always material prominently featuring vocals. Perhaps the earliest example was [[Goldie]]'s ''[[Timeless (Goldie album)|Timeless]]'' album of 1995, along with Reprazent's ''New Forms'' in 1997.  More recently, tracks such as [[Shy FX]] and [[T-Power]]'s &quot;Shake UR Body&quot; gained a UK Top 40 Chart placing. [[Hive (record producer)|Hive's]] &quot;Ultrasonic Sound&quot; was also used in ''[[The Matrix]]'' soundtrack. More recently, video game tracks, specifically [[Rockstar Games]] releases, have contained many drum and bass tracks, i.e. the [[MSX]]/[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories soundtrack#MSX 98|MSX 98]] radio station in ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]''.

On the other hand, [[pop music]] has also occasionally co-opted elements of drum and bass, albeit in watered-down fashion. Examples include [[Puretone]] and [[Girls Aloud]].  Drum and bass also often appears in advertising and TV.

==Record labels==

==Accessing drum and bass==
===Purchasing===
Drum and bass is mostly sold in 12-inch [[vinyl record|vinyl]] single format, although some albums, compilations and DJ mixes are sold on [[CD]]. File downloads are also becoming increasingly available.  Purchasing drum and bass can involve searching specialized record shops or using one of many online vinyl, CD and mp3 retailers, see [[List of drum &amp; bass on-line purchasing sites]].

===Media===
The best known drum and bass publication is ''[[Knowledge (magazine)|Knowledge]]''. Other publications include the longest running drum and bass magazine worldwide ''[[ATM Magazine]]'', [[Canada|Canadian]]-based ''[[Rinse Magazine]]'' and [[Austrian]]-based ''[[Resident (magazine)|Resident]]''.

The highest profile drum and bass radio show is [[Fabio (DJ)|Fabio]] and [[Grooverider]] on [[BBC Radio One]].  The BBC's &quot;urban&quot; station [[BBC 1Xtra|1Xtra]] also features the genre heavily, with DJs [[L Double]] and [[Bailey (DJ)|Bailey]] and Flight.  The genre has long been supported by [[pirate radio]] stations, particularly in London; these days, they are joined by a large, and ever-expanding number, of [[internet radio]] stations available globally. In the [[United States|US]], [[XM Satellite Radio]] dedicates two hours a day to its drum and bass show, &quot;Pressure&quot;, on channel 80 - [[The Move (XM)]].

Drum and bass has a strong online presence with many dedicated portals, forums and communities.  Some of the largest of these are linked below.

'''Donald Ervin Knuth''' (born [[January 10]], [[1938]]) is a renowned [[computer science|computer scientist]] and [[Emeritus_Professor#Other_positions:|professor emeritus]] at [[Stanford University]].

Knuth (pronounced &quot;Ka-NOOTH&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; at Stanford site]&lt;/ref&gt; is best known as the author of the multi-volume ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', one of the most highly respected references in the computer science field. He practically created the field of rigorous [[analysis of algorithms]], and made many seminal contributions to several branches of [[theoretical computer science]]. He is the creator of the [[TeX|T&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;X]] typesetting system and of the [[Metafont|METAFONT]] font design system, and pioneered the concept of [[literate programming]]. 

He also has a [[Chinese name]] 高德纳 ([[pinyin]]: G&amp;#257;o Dénà), given in 1977 by Frances Yao.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot; /&gt;

==Education and academic work==
Born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], he received his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] (simultaneously, his B.S. work being regarded as deserving a masters degree) in [[1960]] at the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] (now the [[Case School of Engineering]], a part of [[Case Western Reserve University]]). In [[1963]], he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he became a professor and began work on ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', originally planned as a seven-volume  series. In [[1968]], he published the first volume. That same year, he joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]]. 

In [[1971]], Knuth was the recipient of the first [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]]. He has received various other awards including the [[Turing Award]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[John von Neumann Medal]] and the [[Kyoto Prize]].  After producing the third volume of his series in [[1976]], he expressed such frustration with the antiquated state of publishing tools that he took time out to work on phototypesetting and created the [[TeX|T&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;X]] and [[METAFONT]] tools. 

In recognition of Knuth's contributions to the field of [[computer science]], in [[1990]] he was awarded the singular academic title of ''Professor of the Art of Computer Programming'', which has since been revised to ''Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming''.
 
In [[1992]] he became an associate of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at [[Stanford University]] in order to finish ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. In [[2003]] he was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. As of [[2004]], the first three volumes of his series have been re-issued, and Knuth is currently working on volume four, excerpts of which are released periodically on his website. Meanwhile, Knuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at [[Stanford University]], which he calls Computer Musings.  He is also a visiting professor at the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Trivia==
Knuth is a [[famous programmer]] known for his [[geek]] humor:
[[Image:knuth-check2.png|thumb|right|One of Donald Knuth's reward checks]]
*He pays a [[knuth reward check|finder's fee of $2.56]] for any typos/mistakes discovered in his books, because ''&quot;256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar&quot;.'' (His bounty for errata in ''3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated,'' is, however, $3.16). According to an article in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s ''Technology Review'', these reward checks are &quot;among computerdom's most prized trophies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/99/09/ditlea0999.asp &quot;Rewriting the Bible in 0's and 1's&quot;] in the [[Technology Review]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Version numbers of his [[TeX|T&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;X]] software approach the [[transcendental number]] [[pi|&amp;pi;]], that is versions increment in the style 3, 3.1, 3.14 and so on. Version numbers of [[Metafont]] approach the number [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']] similarly.
*He once warned users of his software, ''&quot;Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot; /&gt;
*All appendixes in the [[Computers and Typesetting]] series have titles that begin with the letter identifying the appendix.
* TAOCP v3 (1973) has the index entry &quot;Royalties, use of, 405&quot;. Page 405 has no explicit mention of royalties, but does contain a diagram of an &quot;organ-pipe arrangement&quot; in Figure 2. Apparently the purchase of the pipe organ in his home (see '''Personal''' below) was financed by royalties from TAOCP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/organ.html &quot;Pipe Organ&quot; at Stanford site]&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the Preface of ''Concrete Mathematics'': When DEK taught [[Concrete Mathematics]] at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft. He announced that, contrary to the expectations of some of his colleagues, he was ''not'' going to teach the [[Theory of Aggregates]], nor [[Stone's Embedding Theorem]], nor even the [[Stone-Čech compactification]]. (Several students from the [[civil engineering]] department got up and quietly left the room.)

In addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth is also the author of ''3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated'' ([[1991]]), ISBN 0895792524, in which he attempts to examine the Bible by a process of [[stratified sampling|stratified random sampling]], namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book. Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of [[Hermann Zapf]].

Knuth published his first &quot;scientific&quot; article in a school magazine in [[1957]] under the title &quot;[[Potrzebie]] System of Weights and Measures.&quot; In it, he defined the [[fundamental unit]] of [[length]] as the thickness of [[MAD Magazine|''MAD'' magazine]] #26, and named the fundamental unit of [[force]] &quot;whatmeworry&quot;. ''MAD'' magazine bought the article and published it in the June 1957 issue.

Knuth's first &quot;mathematical&quot; article was a short paper submitted to a &quot;science
talent search&quot; contest for high-school seniors in [[1955]], and published in [[1960]],
in which he discussed number systems where the radix was negative.  He 
further generalized this to number systems where the radix was a complex number.
In particular, he defined the [[quater-imaginary base|quater-imaginary number system]], which uses the imaginary number 2i as the base, having the unusual feature that every complex number can be represented with the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3, without a sign. 

==Personal==
Knuth's hobbies include music, specifically playing the [[organ (music)|organ]]. He has a pipe organ installed in his home. Knuth disclaims any particular talent in the instrument, however. He does not use [[email]], saying that he used it from about 1975 until [[January 1]], [[1990]], and that was enough for one lifetime. He finds it more efficient to respond to correspondence in &quot;batch mode&quot;, such as one day every three months, to be sent by [[Mail|postal mail]].

He is married to [[Jill Knuth]] &lt;ref&gt;
[http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/Slissenko60/Knuth.gif Early picture]&lt;/ref&gt;, who published a book on [[liturgy]] titled ''Banner without Words'', published by Resource Publications in 1986. They have two children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dairy products''' are generally defined as [[food]]stuffs produced from [[milk]]. A production plant for such processing is called a [[dairy]]. Raw milk for processing generally comes from [[cattle|cow]]s, but occasionally from other [[mammal]]s such as [[domestic goat|goats]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[water buffalo]], [[yak]]s, or [[horse]]s.

[[Got Milk?]] is an international organization supporting dairy products, especially [[milk]].

== History ==
Most dairy products were developed in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]; the people of these continents have traditionally been the most active in terms of exploiting [[cattle]] as a primary food source. Some dairy products originate from other countries, like [[India]]n [[ghee]]. A small number of non-[[cow]] dairy products exist like [[Italy|Italian]] [[water buffalo]] [[mozzarella]] cheese, [[yak]] butter in [[Tibet]] or the fermented [[horse]] milk drink called [[airag]] in [[Mongolia]].

Dairy products were exported to the rest of the world during the 16th and 17th centuries.  They are now universally popular, despite the fact that some people cannot consume them in adulthood because of [[lactose intolerance]].

== Criticism ==

[[Vegan]]s and some [[vegetarian]]s avoid dairy products due to various reasons, such as [[ethic]]al, [[health]], [[environment]]al considerations, and others.

== Eggs as dairy? ==
[[Egg (food)|Egg]]s and milk products are in some circumstances grouped together under the heading of dairy, probably because fresh eggs were often sold by milkmen. For example, the [[Open Directory Project]] at one point listed cooking eggs as a subcategory of cooking dairy products. However, dictionary definitions of &quot;dairy&quot; are limited to milk products and, as a result, will always exclude eggs and egg products. 

== Beef as dairy? ==
Although milk comes from cows, [[beef]] is not considered a dairy product. Dairy products are considered by some to be [[vegetarian]] while beef, as meat, is not.

      <comment>rv - Mojave or Sonoran deserts are not &quot;prominently discussed&quot; here (see [[Wikipedia:Categorization]])</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Saudi-desert.gif|thumb|right|300px|Desert view in Saudi Arabia. The vast majority of the kingdom is sand desert, with distinct features and characteristics that clearly differ between one area and another.]]
In [[geography]], a '''desert''' is a landscape form or region that receives little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] - less than 250 [[millimeter|mm]] (10 [[inch|in]]) per year. Deserts have a reputation for supporting very little life. Compared to wetter regions this may be true, although upon closer examination, deserts often harbor a wealth of life that usually remains hidden (especially during the daylight) to preserve moisture. Approximately one-third of Earth's land surface is desert. 

Desert landscapes have certain common features. Desert soil is often composed mostly of rocky surfaces called [[reg]]s. [[Sand dunes]] called [[Erg (disambiguation)|erg]]s and stony or [[hamada]] surfaces compose the minority of desert surfaces. Exposures of [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] terrain are typical, and reflect minimal soil development and sparseness of vegetation. Bottom lands may be [[salt]]-covered flats. [[Eolian]] (wind-driven) processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes.

Deserts sometimes contain valuable mineral deposits that were formed in the arid environment or that were exposed by erosion. Because deserts are dry, they are ideal places for human artifacts and fossils to be preserved.

In the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, they are classed as (BW).  

==Types of desert==
[[Image:Désert-du-Thar.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Thar Desert]] near [[Jaisalmer]], [[India]]]]
Most classifications rely on some combination of the number of days of [[rain]]fall, the total amount of annual rainfall, temperature, [[humidity]], or other factors. In [[1953]], [[Peveril Meigs]] divided desert regions on Earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least 12 consecutive months without rainfall, arid lands have less than 250 millimeters of annual rainfall, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500 millimeters. Arid and extremely arid land are deserts, and semiarid grasslands generally are referred to as [[steppes]].

However, lack of rainfall alone can't provide an accurate description of what a desert is.  For example, [[Phoenix, Arizona]] receives less than 250 millimeters, (10 inches), of precipitation per year, and is immediately recognized as being located in a desert.  The [[North Slope]] of Alaska's [[Brooks Range]] also receives less than 250 millimeters of precipitation per year, but is not generally recognized as a desert region.

The difference lies in something termed &quot;potential [[evapotranspiration]].&quot; 
The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P-PE+/-S, whereby P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. 
Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric [[evaporation]], coupled with the evaporative loss of water through the life processes of plants.  Potential evapotranspiration, then, is the amount of water that ''could'' evaporate in any given region.  [[Tucson, Arizona]] receives about 300 millimeters, (12 inches), of rain per year, however about 2500 millimeters, (100 inches), of water could evaporate over the course of a year.  In other words, about 8 times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls.  Rates of evapotranspiration in other regions such as Alaska are much lower, so while these regions receive minimal precipitation, they should be designated as specifically different from the simple definition of a desert:  a place where evaporation exceeds precipitation.

That said, there are different forms of deserts. Cold deserts can be covered in [[snow]]; such locations don't receive much precipitation, and what does fall remains frozen as snow pack; these are more commonly referred to as [[tundra]] if a short season of above-freezing temperatures is experienced, or as an [[ice cap]] if the temperature remains below freezing year-round, rendering the land almost completely lifeless.

Most non-polar deserts are hot because they have little [[water]]. Water tends to have a cooling, or at least a moderating,  effect in environments where it is plentiful. In some parts of the world deserts are created by a [[rain shadow]] effect in which air masses lose much of their moisture as they move over a [[mountain range]]; other areas are arid by virtue of being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture (this is true in some middle-latitude landmass interior locations, particularly in [[Asia]]).

Deserts are also classified by their geographical location and dominant weather pattern as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or [[polar desert]]s. Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments are paleodeserts, and extraterrestrial deserts exist on other planets.

===Montane deserts===
[[Montane]]deserts are arid places with a very high [[altitude]]; the most prominent example is found north of the [[Himalaya]], in parts of the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Many locations within this category have elevations exceeding 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) and the thermal regime can be [[hemiboreal]]. These places owe their profound aridity (the average annual precipitation is often less than 40mm) to being very far from the nearest available sources of moisture.

==Desert features==

[[Sand]] covers only about 20 percent of Earth's deserts. Most of the sand is in [[sand sheet]]s and sand seas&amp;mdash;vast regions of undulating dunes resembling ocean waves &quot;frozen&quot; in an instant of time. In general, there are 6 forms of deserts:
* Mountain and basin deserts;
* Hamada deserts, which comprise of a plateaux landforms;
* Regs which consist of rock pavements;
* Ergs which are formed by sand seas;
* Intermontane Basins; and
* Badlands which are located at the margins of arid lands comprising of clay-rich soil.

Nearly 100 percent of desert surfaces are plains where [[eolian deflation]]&amp;mdash;removal of fine-grained material by the wind&amp;mdash;has exposed loose gravels consisting predominantly of [[pebble]]s but with occasional [[cobble]]s.

The remaining surfaces of arid lands are composed of exposed [[bedrock]] outcrops, desert soils, and [[fluvial deposit]]s including [[alluvial fan]]s, [[playa]]s, desert [[lake]]s, and oases/oasis. Bedrock outcrops commonly occur as small mountains surrounded by extensive erosional plains. 

There are several different types of dunes. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface and are crescent shaped. Longitudinal or seif dunes are dunes that are parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run are a right angle to the constant wind direction. Star dunes are star-shaped and have several ridges that spread out around a point.

[[Oasis|Oases]] are vegetated areas moistened by [[spring (water)|springs]], [[well]]s, or by [[irrigation]]. Many are artificial. Oases are often the only places in deserts that support crops and permanent habitation.

===Soils===
[[Image:Dessication.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ground in the desert tends to crack due to the dryness.]] [[Soil]]s that form in arid climates are predominantly mineral soils (classified as [[Aridisols]]) with low organic content such as salt. The repeated accumulation of water in some soils causes distinct salt layers to form. [[Calcium carbonate]] precipitated from solution may cement sand and gravel into hard layers called &quot;[[calcrete]]&quot; that form layers up to 50 meters thick.

[[Caliche]] is a reddish-brown to white layer found in many desert soils. Caliche commonly occurs as nodules or as coatings on mineral grains formed by the complicated interaction between water and [[carbon dioxide]] released by plant roots or by decaying organic material.

===Vegetation===
Most desert plants are drought- or salt-tolerant, such as [[xerophyte]]s. Some store water in their leaves, roots, and stems. Other desert plants have long [[tap root]]s that penetrate the water table, anchor the soil, and control erosion. The stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion.

Deserts typically have a plant cover that is sparse but enormously diverse. The [[Sonoran Desert]] of the American Southwest has the most complex desert vegetation on Earth. The giant [[saguaro cactus|saguaro cacti]] provide nests for desert birds and serve as &quot;trees&quot; of the desert. Saguaro grow slowly but may live 200 years. When 9 years old, they are about 15 centimeters high. After about 75 years, the cacti develop their first branches. When fully grown, saguaro are 15 meters tall and weigh as much as 10 tons. They dot the Sonoran and reinforce the general impression of deserts as cacti-rich land.

Although cacti are often thought of as characteristic desert plants, other types of plants have adapted well to the arid environment. They include the [[pea]] family and [[sunflower]] family. Cold deserts have grasses and shrubs as dominant vegetation.

===Water===
[[Image:Moving sand simulator questacon.jpg|thumb|left|The shifting sands simulator at [[Questacon]], Canberra]]
Rain does fall occasionally in deserts, and desert storms are often violent. A record 44 millimeters of rain once fell within 3 hours in the Sahara. Large Saharan storms may deliver up to 1 millimeter per minute. Normally dry stream channels, called [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] or [[wadi]]s, can quickly fill after heavy rains, and [[flash flood]]s make these channels dangerous.

Though little rain falls in deserts, deserts receive runoff from ephemeral, or short-lived, streams fed by rain and snow from adjacent highlands. These streams fill the channel with a slurry of mud and commonly transport considerable quantities of sediment for a day or two. Although most deserts are in basins with closed, or interior drainage, a few deserts are crossed by 'exotic' rivers that derive their water from outside the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and evaporate large amounts of water on their journeys through the deserts, but their volumes are such that they maintain their continuity. The [[Nile River]], the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], and the [[Yellow River]] are exotic rivers that flow through deserts to deliver their sediments to the sea.

Lakes form where rainfall or meltwater in interior drainage basins is sufficient. Desert lakes are generally shallow, temporary, and salty. Because these lakes are shallow and have a low bottom gradient, wind stress may cause the lake waters to move over many square kilometers. When small lakes dry up, they leave a salt crust or [[hardpan]]. The flat area of clay, silt, or sand encrusted with salt that forms is known as a playa. There are more than a hundred playas in North American deserts. Most are relics of large lakes that existed during the last [[ice age]] about 12,000 years ago. [[Lake Bonneville]] was a 52,000-square-kilometer lake almost 300 meters deep in Utah, Nevada, and Idaho during the Ice Age. Today the remnants of Lake Bonneville include Utah's [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Utah Lake]], and [[Sevier Lake]]. Because playas are arid land forms from a wetter past, they contain useful clues to climatic change.

When the occasional precipitation does occur, it erodes the desert rocks quickly and powerfully. Wind is the other factor that erodes deserts- they are constant yet slow.

The flat terrains of hardpans and playas make them excellent race tracks and natural runways for airplanes and spacecraft. Ground-vehicle speed records are commonly established on [[Bonneville Speedway]], a race track on the Great Salt Lake hardpan. Space shuttles land on [[Rogers Lake Playa]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California.

==Mineral resources==
Some [[mineral]] deposits are formed, improved, or preserved by geologic processes that occur in arid lands as a consequence of climate. [[Ground water]] [[leaching|leach]]es [[ore]] minerals and redeposits them in zones near the [[water table]]. This leaching process concentrates these minerals as ore that can be mined.

Evaporation in arid lands enriches mineral accumulation in their lakes. Playas may be sources of mineral deposits formed by evaporation. Water evaporating in closed basins precipitates minerals such as [[gypsum]], salts (including [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium chloride]]), and [[borate]]s. The minerals formed in these [[evaporite]] deposits depend on the composition and temperature of the saline waters at the time of deposition.

Significant evaporite resources occur in the [[Great Basin Desert]] of the United States, mineral deposits made forever famous by the &quot;20-mule teams&quot; that once hauled borax-laden wagons from [[Death Valley]] to the [[railroad]]. [[Boron]], from [[borax]] and borate evaporites, is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of glass, ceramics, enamel, agricultural chemicals, water softeners, and pharmaceuticals. Borates are mined from evaporite deposits at [[Searles Lake]], California, and other desert locations. The total value of chemicals that have been produced from Searles Lake substantially exceeds [[US dollar|US$]]1 [[billion]].

The [[Atacama Desert]] of [[South America]] is unique among the deserts of the world in its great abundance of saline minerals. Sodium nitrate has been mined for [[explosive]]s and [[fertilizer]] in the Atacama since the middle of the [[19th century]]. Nearly 3 million [[tonne]]s were mined during [[World War I]].

Valuable minerals located in arid lands include [[copper]] in the United States, Chile, [[Peru]], and [[Iran]]; [[iron]] and [[lead]]-[[zinc]] ore in Australia; [[chromite]] in [[Turkey]]; and [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[uranium]] deposits in Australia and the United States. Nonmetallic mineral resources and rocks such as [[beryllium]], [[mica]], [[lithium]], [[clay]]s, [[pumice]], and [[scoria]] also occur in arid regions. [[Sodium carbonate]], [[sulfate]], borate, [[nitrate]], lithium, [[bromine]], [[iodine]], [[calcium]], and [[strontium]] compounds come from sediments and near-surface brines formed by evaporation of inland bodies of water, often during geologically recent times.

The [[Green River Formation]] of [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] contains [[alluvial]] fan deposits and playa evaporites created in a huge lake whose level fluctuated for millions of years. Economically significant deposits of [[trona]], a major source of [[sodium]] compounds, and thick layers of [[oil shale]] were created in the arid environment.

Some of the more productive [[petroleum]] areas on Earth are found in arid and semiarid regions of Africa and the Mideast, although the [[oil field]]s were originally formed in shallow marine environments. Recent climate change has placed these reservoirs in an arid environment.

Other oil reservoirs, however, are presumed to be eolian in origin and are presently found in humid environments. The [[Rotliegendes]], a [[hydrocarbon]] reservoir in the [[North Sea]], is associated with extensive evaporite deposits. Many of the major U.S. hydrocarbon resources may come from eolian sands. Ancient alluvial fan sequences may also be hydrocarbon reservoirs.

}}'''David Eric Grohl''' (born [[January 14]], [[1969]], in [[Warren, Ohio]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock (music)|rock]] musician. He was the [[drummer]] of the [[grunge music|grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] from [[1990]] until the band dissolved in [[1994]] after frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death. He formed the [[Foo Fighters (band)|Foo Fighters]] in 1995.
Grohl began his music career in the [[1980s]] as the drummer for several [[Washington, DC]] area bands, most notably the [[punk rock]] band [[Scream (band)|Scream]].  

==Early life==
When Grohl was a young child, his family (father James, mother Virginia, and an older sister) relocated from Ohio to [[Alexandria, Virginia]], a suburb of Washington, DC.  Three years later, his parents divorced, and Grohl grew up living with his mother.

At the age of twelve, Grohl began tinkering with the guitar.  He started with lessons, but eventually grew tired of them, and began to play in bands with friends.  A year later, a summer stay at his cousin's house spawned Grohl's interest in [[punk rock]].  Grohl's cousin Tracy took him to numerous punk shows during that summer, and Grohl returned to Alexandria as a convert.

Over the next several years, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint on guitar in a band called Freak Baby.  At the same time, he had been teaching himself to play drums by banging on various items in his bedroom.  When Freak Baby kicked out its bass player, Grohl decided to switch to drums, and the new band coined itself Mission Impossible.{{ref|early}}  He later joined a hardcore/post-punk band called Dain Bramage.  During his developing years as a drummer, Grohl cited [[John Bonham]] as his greatest influence, and eventually had Bonham's three-circle logo [[tattoo]]ed on his wrist.

==Scream==
{{main|Scream (band)}}
At the age of sixteen, Grohl scored an audition with local DC favorites [[Scream (band)|Scream]] to fill the vacancy left by the departure of drummer Kent Stax. To Grohl's surprise, the band asked him to join.  After waffling for a brief period, Grohl accepted the offer.  Not long after, he dropped out of high school to play drums full-time.  Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple of live albums and one studio album, ''Fumble'', on which Grohl penned and sang vocals on the song &quot;Gods Look Down&quot;.

While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of [[The Melvins]] and eventually befriended the band.  During a [[1990]] tour stop on the west coast, The Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] took a couple of his friends, [[Kurt Cobain]] and &lt;!--Krist is listed here as &quot;Chris&quot; because he went by Chris at the time.--&gt; [[Krist Novoselic|Chris Novoselic]], to see the band.

==Nirvana==
{{main|Nirvana (band)}}
A few months later, Scream unexpectedly disbanded following the departure of its bass player, and Grohl placed a phone call to Osborne for advice.  Knowing how much Cobain and Novoselic liked Grohl's drumming, Osborne gave Novoselic's phone number to Grohl.  Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle, where Grohl attended Nirvana's infamous show at the Motor Sports Garage, the one Nirvana show that featured [[Dan Peters]] on drums.  (Grohl admitted to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2005 that he spent most of Nirvana's set outside talking to a friend.)  Grohl subsequently auditioned for the band, and soon joined the band full-time.

At the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for what would be the follow-up to their debut album ''[[Bleach (album)|Bleach]]'', having spent time recording with producer [[Butch Vig]] in [[Wisconsin]].  Initially, the plans were to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band found itself receiving a great deal of major label interest based on the demos.  Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana travelling to various major labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].  In the spring of 1991, the band entered the studio to record the album.

Upon its release, ''[[Nevermind]]'' exceeded all expectations and became a massive success, catapulting the band to worldwide stardom.  At the same time, Grohl found himself fighting with his status in the band.  While his drumming style was a significant element in the band's success, Grohl saw himself as just another in a long line of drummers.  In his mind, Nirvana was the band that recorded ''Bleach''; his arrival had altered that sound dramatically, and, as he saw it, not necessarily in a positive way.  Though Grohl had been writing songs for several years, he declined to introduce his songs to the band for fear of damaging the band's chemistry.  Instead, Grohl compiled his songs and recorded them himself, releasing a cassette demo called ''Pocketwatch'' in [[1992]] on indie label Simple Machines.  Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym &quot;Late!&quot;.

In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased.  In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot;, and the two ended up jamming on it.  During the sessions for ''[[In Utero]]'', the band decided to record the song, and released it as a b-side on the &quot;[[Heart-Shaped Box]]&quot; single, titled simply &quot;Marigold&quot;.  Earlier, as the band worked on new material for ''In Utero'', Grohl contributed the main guitar riff for what ended up becoming &quot;[[Scentless Apprentice]]&quot;.  Cobain conceded in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was &quot;kind of boneheaded&quot;, but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]'').  Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band decided to schedule session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos.  For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs.  The duo completed several of Grohl's, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs &quot;Exhausted&quot;, &quot;[[Big Me]]&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot;, and &quot;Butterflies&quot;.  On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named &quot;[[You Know You're Right]]&quot;.  It was the band's final studio recording.

Following Cobain's death in April of 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself.  Initially, Grohl believed his future might be in drumming for other bands, and took a brief turn with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], including a memorable performance on [[Saturday Night Live]].  The band asked him to join permanently, but Grohl realized that his future lay elsewhere.

Grohl decided to schedule studio time, again at Robert Lang's Studio, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo.  With the exception of a single guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot; played by Greg Dulli of the [[Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.  Grohl began passing the demo around, and soon found himself with considerable major label interest.  Nirvana's A&amp;R rep Gary Gersh had subsequently taken over as President of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label.  Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock and released in 1995 as the Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].  Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career so he recruited other band members: former Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and two members of the band [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass).

At the end of 1995, the Foo Fighters were asked to contribute a song to the soundtrack to the television show [[The X-Files]].  During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s &quot;[[Down in the Park]]&quot;.  In February of 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief cameo appearance on the X-Files episode &quot;The Pusher&quot;.  (The two can be spotted entering the FBI building, with Grohl pausing to look at his watch.)

[[Image:Touch.jpg|200px|thumb|''Touch'' soundtrack album cover]]After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the [[1997]] movie ''Touch''.  Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt]] singer Louise Post on the title track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (US band)|X]]'s [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on &quot;This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)&quot;.  Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined the Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.

In the midst of the initial sessions for the Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and Goldsmith.  Grohl felt that Goldsmith's efforts weren't as strong as they needed to be, and opted to re-record some of Goldsmith's drum parts himself.  Goldsmith, who found himself battling [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] from years of pounding the drums, was upset by Grohl's action, and quit the band. (In subsequent interviews, Grohl conceded that the band may have moved into the studio too quickly after the lengthy touring for the debut.)  Grohl and the rest of the band decided to scrap the Seattle sessions and start over in [[Los Angeles]] with Grohl behind the kit. 

The effort was released in May of 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented the Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio.  The album spawned several hits, including &quot;[[Everlong]]&quot;, &quot;[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]&quot;.  Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums.  The following September, Smear left the band, citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring.  Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl.  (Stahl departed the band prior to recording of the Foo's third album and was replaced by touring guitarist Chris Shiflett, who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One]]''.)

Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with the Foo Fighters' popularity.  During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] before returning to his native [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the [[1999]] album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.

In [[2000]], the band recruited [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] to add some guitar flourish to a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, a song which the Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side.  The friendship between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[2001]].  Grohl and Hawkins joined May and Queen drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] to perform &quot;[[Tie Your Mother Down]]&quot;, with Grohl standing in on vocals for the late [[Freddie Mercury]].  (May later contributed guitar work for the song &quot;Tired of You&quot; on the ensuing Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called &quot;Knucklehead&quot;.)

[[Image:DaveGrohlphoto.jpg|thumb|right|Grohl at the Roskilde Festival in 2005]]

Near the end of 2001, the Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album.  After four months in the studio, with the sessions &quot;finished&quot;, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''.  (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song &quot;[[No One Knows]]&quot;.)  After a brief US tour with the band and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other Foo Fighters to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia.  The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One]]''.  While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Dave Grohl admitted to not liking the record:  &quot;Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.&quot;

Grohl and the Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005.  Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed Studio 606, located in a warehouse near Los Angeles.  Featuring collaborations with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and [[Norah Jones]], the album was a departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.

==Other Projects==

Apart from his main bands, Grohl has been involved in other music projects.  In 1993, Grohl was recruited to help recreate the music of [[The Beatles]]' early years for the movie ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]''.  Grohl played drums in an &quot;all-star&quot; lineup that included [[Greg Dulli]] of the [[Afghan Whigs]], indie producer Don Fleming, [[Mike Mills]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]].  A music video was filmed for the song &quot;[[Money (That's What I Want)]]&quot; while Grohl was with Nirvana on their 1994 European tour, but footage of Grohl was filmed later and included.

During the early 2000s, Grohl spent time in his basement studio writing and recording a number of songs for a &quot;[[Metal music|metal]]&quot; project.  Over the span of several years, Grohl recruited his favorite metal vocalists from the 1980s, including [[Lemmy Kilmister]] of [[Motörhead]], Cronos from [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Max Cavalera]] of [[Sepultura]], to perform the vocals for the songs.  According to an interview published in the magazine ''[[Guitar World]]'', the project began as a self-induced backlash against the more radio-friendly material Grohl wrote for ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''.  The project was released in 2003 under the [[moniker]] [[PROBOT]].

Also in 2003, Grohl stepped behind the kit to perform on [[Killing Joke]]'s [[Killing_Joke_2003_(album)|self-titled album]].  The move surprised some Nirvana fans, given that Nirvana had been accused of stealing the opening riff of &quot;[[Come As You Are]]&quot; from Killing Joke's [[1984]] song &quot;Eighties&quot;.  However, the controversy failed to create a lasting rift between the bands.  The Foo Fighters made a habit of covering Killing Joke's &quot;Requiem&quot; during the late 1990s, and were even joined by Killing Joke singer [[Jaz Coleman]] for a performance of the song at a show in [[New Zealand]] in 2003.

Grohl lent his drumming skills to other artists during the early 2000s.  In 2002, Grohl performed on [[Tenacious D]]'s debut album, and appeared in the video for lead single &quot;[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]&quot; as the [[Devil|devil]].  A year later, Grohl helped [[Chan Marshall]] of [[Cat Power]] on the album ''[[You Are Free]]''.  In [[2004]], Grohl drummed on several tracks for [[Nine Inch Nails]]' 2005 album ''[[With Teeth]]''.  He also drummed on the song &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; on [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]'s 2005 album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]''.  Beyond drumming, Grohl contributed guitar to a cover of [[Neil Young]]'s &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; on [[David Bowie]]'s 2002 album ''[[Heathen (album)|Heathen]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This page is about the '''dollar currency'''. For information about the Scottish town of Dollar, see [[Dollar, Clackmannanshire]]''

The '''dollar''' (represented by the [[dollar sign]]: &quot;$&quot;) is the name of the official [[currency]] in several countries, dependencies and other regions. The [[United States dollar]] is the world's most widely circulated currency.

==History==
The name is related to the historic currencies Tolar in [[Bohemia]], [[Thaler]] or Taler in [[Germany]], [[Dutch gulden|daalder]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Riksdaler|daler]] in [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]]. The name ''Thaler'' (from ''Thal,'' or nowadays usually ''Tal,'' &quot;valley&quot;) originally came from the German ''Guldengroschen'' (&quot;great gulden&quot;, being of [[silver]] but equal in value to a [[gold]] gulden) coin, minted from the silver from a rich mine at [[Joachimsthal]] (St. Joachim's Valley) in [[Bohemia]] (then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). 

The name &quot;[[Spanish dollar]]&quot; was used for a Spanish silver coin, the [[peso]], worth eight reals (hence the nickname &quot;pieces of eight&quot;), which was widely circulated during the [[18th century]] in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the New World]]. The use of the Spanish dollar and the [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] thaler as legal tender for the early [[United States]] is the reason for the name of the nation's currency. However, the word ''dollar'' was in use in the [[English language]] for the thaler for about 200 years before the [[American Revolution]]. Spanish dollars were in circulation in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that became the United States, and were [[legal tender]] in [[Virginia]]. 

Coins known as dollars were also in use in [[Scotland]] during the [[17th century]], and there is a claim that the use of the English word, and perhaps even the use of the coin, began at the [[University of St Andrews]]. This explains why the sum of 'Ten thousand dollars' mentioned in [[Macbeth]] (Act I, Scene II) is not an anachronism.

In the early 19th century, a British five shilling piece, or [[Crown (British coin)|Crown]], was sometimes called a dollar, probably because its appearance was similar to the Spanish dollar. This expression appeared again in the 1940s, when U.S. troops came to the UK during [[World War II]]. At the time a U.S. dollar was worth exactly 5s., so some of the U.S. soldiers started calling it a dollar. Consequently, they called the [[half crown]] &quot;half a dollar&quot;, and the expression caught on among some locals and could be heard into the 1960s.

==Synonyms and slang==
* The word ''buck'', possibly an abbreviation from ''buckskin,'' an intrinsic 'currency' for trade with American Indians known since [[1746]], has been recorded since [[1856]] and is widely used as a synonym for the dollars of many countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The latter term, ''skin'', is also used as a synonym as is the possibly related term ''squaw money.''
* ''Greenback'', a nickname originally applied to a 19th-century United States [[Federal Reserve]] note, is now a common specific reference to the [[U.S. dollar]] (bills of which are now green on both sides); it is not used for coins or dollars of other countries.

==Symbol==
The [[dollar sign]] ($) is a stylization of the heraldic depiction of the [[Pillars of Hercules]] (representing the Straits of [[Gibraltar]]) on Spanish pieces of eight. The notion that it originated as a crossed &quot;U&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, for &quot;United States&quot;, and that the bottom of the &quot;U&quot; somehow ceased to appear, is entirely fanciful, as the symbol was in use before the term &quot;United States&quot; was coined.

==Related names in modern currencies==
*The name of the currency of [[Samoa]], the ''[[Samoan tala|tala]]'' is based on the [[Samoan language|Samoan]] pronunciation of the word &quot;dollar&quot;. Likewise, the name of the smaller unit, ''seneiti'', equates to &quot;cent&quot;.
*The word for the [[Slovenian tolar]] has the same origin as dollar, i.e. [[thaler]].

==National currencies called &quot;dollar&quot;==
*[[Australian dollar]]
*[[Barbados dollar]]
*[[Bahamian dollar]]
*[[Belize dollar]]
*[[Bermuda dollar]]
*[[Brunei dollar]]
*[[Canadian dollar]]
*[[Cayman Islands dollar]]
*[[East Caribbean dollar]]
*[[Fijian dollar]]
*[[Guyanese dollar]]
*[[Hong Kong dollar]]
*[[Jamaican dollar]]
*[[Liberian dollar]]
*[[Namibian dollar]]
*[[New Zealand dollar]]
*[[Singapore dollar]]
*[[Solomon Islands dollar]]
*[[Suriname dollar]]
*[[New Taiwan dollar]]
*[[Trinidad and Tobago dollar]]
*[[United States dollar]]
*[[Zimbabwean dollar]] (see also [[Rhodesian dollar]])

The name has also been applied to the [[international dollar]], a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power that the U.S. dollar has in the United States at a given point in time.

'''Dysprosium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Dy''' and [[atomic number]] 66.

== Notable characteristics ==
Dysprosium is a [[rare earth]] element that has a metallic, bright silver luster, relatively stable in air at room temperature, but dissolving readily in dilute or concentrated [[mineral acid]]s with the emission of [[hydrogen]]. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's characteristics can be greatly affected even by small amounts of impurities.

== Applications ==
Dysprosium is used, in conjunction with [[vanadium]] and other elements, for making [[laser]] materials; its high [[thermal neutron]] absorption cross-section and melting point also suggest using it for [[nuclear control rod]]s, dysprosium oxide (also known as ''dysprosia'') with [[nickel]] [[cement]] compounds which absorb neutrons readily without swelling or contracting under prolonged neutron bombardment, is being used for cooling rods in [[nuclear reactor]]s. Dysprosium-[[cadmium]] [[chalcogen|chalcogenide]]s are sources of [[infrared]] radiation for studying chemical reactions; furthermore, dysprosium is used for manufacturing [[compact disc]]s.

== History ==
Dysprosium was first identified in [[Paris]] in [[1886]] by [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]]; however, the element itself was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of [[ion exchange]] and [[metallographic reduction]] techniques in the [[1950s]]. The name dysprosium is derived from [[Greece|Greek]] ''dysprositos'', &quot;hard to get at&quot;.

== Occurrence ==
Dysprosium is never encountered as the free element, but is found in many [[mineral]]s, including [[xenotime]], [[fergusonite]], [[gadolinite]], [[euxenite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[monazite]] and [[bastnasite]], often with [[erbium]] and [[holmium]] or other rare earth elements.

== Compounds ==
Nearly all dysprosium compounds are in the +3 oxidation state, and are highly [[paramagnetic]].  Dysprosium compounds include:

* [[Fluoride]]s
** [[dysprosium(III) fluoride|DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Chloride]]s
** [[dysprosium(II) chloride|DyCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
** [[dysprosium(III) chloride|DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Bromide]]s
** [[dysprosium(II) bromide|DyBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
** [[dysprosium(III) bromide|DyBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Iodide]]s
** [[dysprosium(II) iodide|DyI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
** [[dysprosium(III) iodide|DyI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Oxide]]s

== Isotopes ==
Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of 7 stable [[isotope]]s, 156-Dy, 158-Dy, 160-Dy, 161-Dy, 162-Dy, 163-Dy and 164-Dy, with 164-Dy being the most abundant (28.18% [[natural abundance]]). 28 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being 154-Dy with a [[half-life]] of 3.0E+6 years, 159-Dy with a half-life of 144.4 days, and 166-Dy with a half-life of 81.6 hours.  All of the remaining [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 10 hours, and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 30 seconds. This element also has 5 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being 165m-Dy (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; 1.257 minutes), 147m-Dy (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; 55.7 seconds) and 145m-Dy (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; 13.6 seconds).

The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, 164-Dy, is [[electron capture]], and the primary mode after is [[beta minus decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before 164-Dy are [[terbium]] isotopes, and the primary products after are [[holmium]] isotopes.

== Precautions ==
As with the other lanthanides, dysprosium compounds are of low to moderate [[toxicity]], although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Dysprosium does not have any known biological properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deforestation''' is the conversion of [[forest]]ed areas to non-forested. Historically, this meant conversion to grassland or to its artificial counterpart, grainfields; however, the [[Industrial Revolution]] added [[urbanization]] and technological uses. Generally this removal or destruction of significant areas of forest cover has resulted in a degraded environment with reduced [[biodiversity]]. In developing countries, massive deforestation is a leading cause of environmental degradation. The forest is an enormously valuable resource and the loss, or degradation of the forest can cause severe and irreparable damage to wildlife habitat, and to other economic and ecological services the forest provides. Historically deforestation has accompanied mankind's progress since the [[Neolithic]], and has shaped [[climate]] and [[geography]].

Deforestation (whether deliberate or unintended) is the result of the removal of trees without sufficient [[Secondary forest|reforestation]].  There are many causes, ranging from extremely slow forest [[land degradation|degradation]] to sudden and catastrophic [[wildfire]]s. Deforestation can be the result of the deliberate removal of forest cover for agriculture or [[Urbanization|urban]] development, or it can be an unintentional consequence of uncontrolled [[grazing]] (which can prevent the natural regeneration of young [[tree]]s).  The combined effect of grazing and fires can be a major cause of deforestation in dry areas.  In addition to the direct effects brought about by forest removal, indirect effects caused by [[edge effect]]s and [[habitat fragmentation]] can greatly magnify the effects of deforestation.

While [[tropical rainforest]] deforestation has attracted most attention, [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forests]] are being lost at a substantially higher rate.

==Effects of deforestation==
Deforestation alters the hydrologic cycle, potentially increasing or decreasing the amount of water in the soil and groundwater and the moisture in the atmosphere. Forests support considerable [[biodiversity]].  Forests are valuable habitat for wild [[mushrooms]] and [[medicinal plants|medicinal conservation]] and the recharge of [[aquifer]]s; on the other hand recent studies that show that planting of new trees can sometimes lower water tables and drain rivers [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7749], and a long term study (for one subcontinent) suggest the net water managament effect of deforestation in the 20th century would be nearly neutral, so more study is required. With forest bioptopes a major, irreplacable source of new drugs (like [[Paclitaxel|taxol]]) and genetic variations (such as crop resistance) is lost irretrievably.

Shrinking forest cover lessens the landscape's  capacity to intercept, retain and transport precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. That quicker transport of surface water can translate into [[flash flood]]ing and more extreme floods than would occur with the forest cover. Deforestation also contributes to decreased [[evapotranspiration]], which lessens atmospheric moisture and precipitation levels, and affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans; in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/pcs/state/chinaeco/forest.htm].  

Although short-sighted, market-driven [[forestry]] practices are often targeted as the primary cause of deforestation, the principal human-related causes are actually agriculture and livestock grazing, urban sprawl, and mining and petroleum extraction. Long-term gains can be obtained by managing forest lands sustainably to maintain both forest cover and provide a biodegrable renewable resource.  Forests are also important stores of organic [[carbon]], and forests can extract carbon dioxide and [[pollutant]]s from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability and probably relevant to the greenhouse effect.  Forests are also valued for their aesthetic beauty and as a cultural resource and tourist attraction.  Deforestation results in the loss of these benefits.

==Definition of deforestation==
Deforestation is the loss or continual degradation of forest habit due to either natural or human related causes. Agriculture, urban sprawl, unsustainable forestry practices, mining, and petroleum exploration all contribute to human caused deforestation. Natural deforestation can be linked to tsunamis, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, glaciation and desertification. The effects of human related deforestation can be mitigated through environmentally sustainable practices that reduce permanent destruction of forests or even act to preserve and rehabilitate disrupted forestland. (See [[Reforestation]], and [[Treeplanting]] )  

The term deforestation is often the source of disagreement between various interest groups. 

Deforestation can be defined broadly to include not only conversion to non-forest, but also degradation that reduces forest quality - the density and structure of the trees, the [[ecosystem services|ecological services]] supplied, the [[biomass]] of plants and animals, the [[species diversity]] and the [[genetic diversity]].  Narrow definitions of deforestation define deforestation as the removal of forest cover to an extent that allows for alternative land use.  The [[United Nations]] Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) uses a broad definition of deforestation, while the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN]] (FAO) uses a narrow definition.

Definitions can also be grouped as those which refer to changes in land cover and those which refer to changes in land use. 

''[[Land cover]]'' measurements often use a percent of cover to determine deforestation. This type of definition has the advantage in that large areas can be easily measured, for example from [[satellite]] photos. A forest cover removal of 90% may still be considered forest in some cases. Under this definition areas that may have few values of a natural forest such as [[plantation]]s and even urban or suburban areas may be considered forest.

''[[Land use]]'' definitions measure deforestation by a change in land use. This definition may consider areas to be forest that are not commonly considered as such. An area can be lacking trees but still considered a forest. It may be a land designated for afforestation or an area designated administratively as forest. 

===Use of the term deforestation===
The term deforestation has been used to refer to [[fuel]] wood cutting, commercial [[logging]] and [[slash and burn]] cultivation. It is also used to describe forest clearing for annual crops, for grazing, and establishment of industrial forest plantations. The meaning of the term is ambiguous enough and so charged with emotion that the use of a more precise term might be better suited in specific cases. Related terms are forest decline, forest fragmentation and forest degradation, loss of forest cover and land use conversion.

==Causes of deforestation==
===Agents===
Agents of deforestation can be individuals or groups of individuals that are clearing the forest. Commercial farmers, slash and burn farmers, cattle ranches and loggers are all agents of deforestation. Agents are usually acting in their own self interest.

===Present Causes===
Causes include demand for farm land and fuel wood. Underlining causes include poverty, lack of reform. The causes of deforestation are complex and change over time. Deforestation can be most easily understood by studying the causes for each forest and country separately.

===Theories of deforestation===
Three schools of thought exist with regards to the causes of deforestation - the ''Impoverishment'' school, which believes that the major cause of deforestation is &quot;''the growing number of poor''&quot;, the ''Neoclassical'' school which believes that the major cause is &quot;''open-access property rights''&quot; and the ''Political-ecology'' school which believes that the major cause of deforestation is that the &quot;''capitalist investors crowd out peasants''&quot;.  The ''Impoverishment'' school sees smallholders as the principal agents of deforestation, the ''Neoclassical'' school sees various agents, and the ''Political-ecology'' school sees capitalist entrepreneurs as the major agents of deforestation.

== History and Historical causes ==
* ''See, [[Timeline of environmental events]]''
===Prehistory===
Deforestation has been practiced by humans for thousands of years.  [[Fire]] was probably the first tool that allowed humans to modify the landscape.  The first evidence of deforestation shows up in the [[Mesolithic]].  Fire was probably used to drive game into more accessible areas.  With the advent of [[agriculture]] fire became the prime tool to clear land for crops.  In [[Europe]] there is little solid evidence before [[7000 BC|5000]] [[Before Present|BP]].  Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer|foragers]] used fire to create openings for [[red deer]] and [[wild boar]].  In [[Britain]] shade tolerant species like [[oak]] and [[Ash tree|ash]] are replaced in the [[palynology|pollen]] record by [[hazel]]s, brambles, grasses and nettles.  Removal of the forests led to decreased [[transpiration]] resulting in the formation of upland [[peat bog]]s.  Widespread decreased in [[elm]] pollen across Europe between 6400-6300 BP and 5200-5000 BP, starting in southern Europe and gradually moving north to Britain, may represent land clearing by fire at the onset of [[Neolithic]] agriculture.

===Pre-industrial history===
The historic [[silting]] of ports along the southern coasts of [[Asia Minor]] (''e.g.'' [[Clarus]], and the examples of [[Ephesus]], [[Priene]] and [[Miletus]], where harbors had to be abandoned because of the silt deposited by the Meander) and in coastal [[Syria]] during the last centuries BC, and the famous silting up of the harbor for [[Bruges]], which moved port commerce to [[Antwerp]], all follow periods of increased settlement growth (and apparently of deforestation) in the river basins of their [[hinterland]]s. In early medieval [[Riez]] in upper Provence, alluvial silt from two small rivers raised the riverbeds and widened the floodplain, which slowly buried the Roman settlement in alluvium and gradually moved new construction to higher ground; concurrently the headwater valleys above Riez were being opened to pasturage. 

A typical [[progress trap]] is that cities are built in a woody area providing the wood for some industry (e.g. shipbuilding, pottery) which starts consuming it so fast &amp;ndash; and without proper replanting &amp;ndash; that it becomes impossible to obtain it close enough to remain competitive, leading to the city's abandonment, as happened repeatedly in Ancient Asia Minor. Especially the combination of mining and metallurgy went along this self-destructive path.

Meanwhile most of the population remaining active in (or indirectly dependend on) the agricultural sector, the main pressure in most areas remained land clearing for crop and cattle farming; fortunately enough wild green was usually left standing (and partially used, e.g. to collect firewood, timber and fruits, or to graze pigs) for wildlife to remain viable, and the hunting privileges of the elite (nobility and higher clergy) often protected significant woodlands.

Major parts in the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the population were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the benedictine and cistercian orders) and some feudal lords actively attracting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and fiscal conditions &amp;ndash; even when they did so to launch or encourage cities, there always was an agricultural belt around and even quite some within the walls. 
When on the other hand demography took a real blow by such causes as the [[Black Death]] or devastating warfare (e.g. [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol]] hords in eastern and central Europe, [[Thirty Years War]] in Germany) this could lead to settlements being abandoned, leaving land to be reclaimed by nature.

The large-scale building of wooden sail ships by European (coastal) naval owers since the 15th century for exploration, colonization, slave &amp;ndash; and other trade on the high seas and (often related) naval warfare (the failed invasion of England by the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1559 and the [[battle of Lepanto]] 1577 are early cases of huge waste of prime timber; each of Nelson's Royal navy war ships at Trafalgar had required 6000 mature oaks) and piracy meant that whole woody regions were over-harvested, as in Spain, were this contributed to the paradoxical weakening of the domestic economy since Columbus' discovery of America made the colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade ...) predominant.

In ''Changes in the Land'' (1983), [[William Cronon]] collected 17th century [[New England]] Englishmen's reports of increased seasonal flooding during the time that the forests were initially cleared, though no connection was made at the time.

=== Industrial pressure===
The massive use of [[charcoal]] on an industrial scale was a new acceleration of the onslaught on western forests; even in Stuart England, the relatively primitive production of charcoal has already reached an impressive level.
One of the best documented and successful attempts at [[reforestation]] was effected by the [[Prussia]]n government in the mid-19th century to save the [[Curonian Spit]] from being engulfed by dunes.

=== Recent changes ===
The rate of clearance increased during the second half of the [[19th century]] due to [[agriculture|agricultural]] expansion in [[Europe]]. Deforestation rates peaked in New England  about 1900 and in the [[Great Lakes]] region of the [[United States]] in the late 19th century. Rates of tropical deforestation have increased substantially into the [[post-war]] period as logging operations became mechanised.

Growing worldwide demand for [[wood]] to be used for fire wood or in construction, paper and furniture - as well as clearing land for commercial and industrial development (including [[road construction]]) have combined with growing local populations and their demands for agricultural expansion and wood fuel to endanger ever larger forest areas.  

Agricultural development schemes in [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and [[Indonesia]] moved large populations into the [[rainforest]] zone, further increasing deforestation rates.  One fifth of the world's tropical rainforest was destroyed between 1960 and 1990. Estimates of deforestation of tropical forest for the 1990s range from ca. 55,630 [[square kilometre|km²]] to ca. 120,000 km² each year. At this rate, all tropical forests may be gone by the year 2090.

== Environmental effects ==
=== Atmospheric pollution ===
Deforestation is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. Trees and other plants remove [[carbon]] (in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]) from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] during the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Both the decay and burning of wood releases much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. A.J.Yeomans asserts in [http://www.yeomansplow.com.au/priority-one.htm Priority One] that overnight a stable forest releases exactly the same quantity of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Others state
that mature forests are net sinks of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[Carbon dioxide sink]] and [[Carbon cycle]]).

=== Wildlife ===
Some forests are rich in [[biological diversity]]. Deforestation can cause the destruction of the habitats that support this biological diversity - thus causing population shifts and [[extinction]]s.

=== Hydrologic cycle and water resources ===
Trees, and plants in general, affect the [[hydrological cycle]] in a number of significant ways:
* their canopies intercept [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], some of which evaporates back to the atmosphere;
* their litter, stems and trunks slow down runoff;
* their roots create macropores - large conduits - in the soil that increase infiltration;
* they transport water from the soil to the atmosphere via [[transpiration]];
* their litter and organic residue change soil properties that affect the capacity of soil to store water.
As a result, the presence or absence of trees can change the quantity of water on the surface, in the soil or groundwater, or in the atmosphere. This in turn changes erosion rates and the availability of water for either ecosystem function or human services.

=== Soil erosion ===
Deforestation generally increases rates of soil [[erosion]], by increasing the amount of [[runoff]] and reducing the protection of the soil from tree litter. This can be an advantage in excessively leached tropical rain forest soils. Forestry operations themselves also increase erosion through the development of roads and the use of mechanized equipment. 

China's Loess Plateau was cleared of forest millennia ago. Since then it has been eroding, creating dramatic incised valleys, and providing the sediment that gives the Yellow River its yellow color and that causes the flooding of the river in the lower reaches (hence the river's nick-name 'China's sorrow').

Removal of trees does not always increase erosion rates. In certain regions of southwest US, shrubs and trees have been encroaching on grassland. The trees themselves enhance the loss of grass between tree canopies. The bare intercanopy areas  become highly erodible. The US Forest Service, in Bandelier National Monument for example, is studying how to restore the former ecosystem, and reduce erosion, by removing the trees.

=== Landslides ===
Tree roots bind soil together, and if the soil is sufficiently shallow they act to keep the soil in place by also binding with underlying [[bedrock]]. Tree removal on steep slopes with shallow soil thus increases the risk of [[landslide]]s.

== Alternatives ==
=== Produce substitution ===
A proposed solution to deforestation is to reduce consumption of forest based products. Switching to brick, stone, [[concrete]], [[fiberglass]] and plastic for construction, or the use of [[hemp]] for paper products are amongst options often considered. However, these options do present their own downsides. Construction materials require fossil fuel derived materials to produce and tend to degrade much more slowly. Conversion of forestlands to agricultural lands to produce hemp can cause deforestation itself. Deforestation can also occur in mining and petroleum exploration.

=== Farming ===
Agriculture is one of the primary causes of deforestation. Once forestland is converted to agricultural land it is rarely allowed  to regenerate back into forestland. However many farmers are now reforesting their land into tree plantations. Although an intensively managed tree plantation does not fully recreate the [[biodiversity]] found in less intensively managed forestlands, it still will provide more biodiversity than a monoculture hemp or potato plantation.  

New methods are being developed to farm more food crops on less farm land, such as high-yield [[hybrid]] crops, [[greenhouse]], [[autonomous building]] gardens, and [[hydroponic]]s. The reduced farm land is then dependent on massive chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields. In cyclic [[agriculture]], cattle are grazed on farm land that is resting and rejuvenating. Cyclic agriculture actually increases the fertility of the soil. Selective over farming can also increase the nutrients by releasing such nutrients from the previously inert subsoil. The constant release of nutrients from the constant exposure of subsoil by slow and gentle erosion is a process that has been ongoing for billions of years. Slash-and-burn agriculture has recently needed re-evalution as it appears to be more sustainable than originally believed.

[[Poaceae|Grass]] is encouraged to grow on the resting farm land. The cows eat the grass and leave behind their dung, which is also a source of fertilizer. This process can reduce deforestation by using farmland to graze instead of using forest land if this is considered advantagious.

== Social change ==
Some societies are making efforts to stop or slow deforestation.  In [[China]], where large scale destruction of forests has occurred, the government has required that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in  other forest services. The government claims that at least 1000 million trees have been planted in China every year since 1982.  In western countries, increasing consumer demand for wood products that have been produced and harvested in a sustainable manner are causing forest landowners and forest industries to become increasingly accountable for their forest management and timber harvesting practices.

The [[Arbor Day Foundation]]'s Rain Forest Rescue program is a charity that helps to prevent deforestation. The charity uses donated money to buy up and preserve rainforest land before the lumber companies can buy it. The Arbor Day Foundation then protects the land from deforestation. This also locks in the way of life of the primitive tribes living on the forest land..

'''Desertification''' is the [[Land degradation|degradation]] of land in [[arid]], [[semi arid]] and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors including [[Climate|climatic]] variations and human activities. Modern desertification often arises from the demands of increased populations that settle on the land in order to grow [[agriculture|crops]] and graze [[animal]]s.

However, there has been major controversy over the definition of the term, as well as its causes. Attempts to define or map areas that are or have turned into desert have been sharply criticized. What is usually less controversial is the fact of biodiversity loss, and loss of productive capacity, such as the transition from grassland dominated by perennial grasses to one dominated by perennial shrubs. In the southwestern deserts of the United States, semiarid ecosystems dominated by perennial bunchgrasses, including [[blue grama]] and [[black grama]], have been replaced by shrublands dominated by creosotebush since the early 1900's. The change in vegetation is thought to have induced desertification in this region.

==Causes==

In some regions around the world, deserts are separated sharply from surrounding, less arid areas by mountains and other contrasting landforms that reflect basic structural differences in the regional geology. In other areas, desert fringes form a gradual transition from a dry to a more humid environment, making it more difficult to define the desert border. These transition zones have very fragile, delicately balanced ecosystems. Desert fringes often are a mosaic of [[microclimate]]s. Small hollows support vegetation that picks up heat from the hot winds and protects the land from the [[prevailing wind]]s. After rainfall the vegetated areas are distinctly cooler than the surroundings.

In these marginal areas human activity may stress the [[ecosystem]] beyond its tolerance limit, resulting in degradation of the land. By pounding the soil with their hooves, [[livestock]] compact the substrate, increase the proportion of fine material, and reduce the [[percolation]] rate of the soil, thus encouraging [[erosion]] by wind and water. Grazing and the collection of firewood reduce or eliminate plants that help to bind the soil.

It is a misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands has accelerated desertification. In some areas, [[nomad]]s moving to less arid areas disrupt the local ecosystem and increase the rate of erosion of the land. Nomads are trying to escape the desert, but because of their land-use practices, they are bringing the desert with them.

Some arid and semi-arid lands can support crops, but additional pressure from greater populations or decreases in rainfall can lead to the few plants present disappearing. The [[soil]] becomes exposed to [[wind]], causing soil particles to be deposited elsewhere. The top layer becomes eroded. With the removal of shade, rates of [[evaporation]] increase and salts become drawn up to the surface. This is [[soil salination|salinisation]], and inhibits plant growth. The loss of plants causes less moisture to be retained in the area, which may change the [[climate]] pattern leading to lower rainfall.

This degradation of formerly productive land is a complex process. It involves multiple causes, and it proceeds at varying rates in different climates. Desertification may intensify a general climatic trend toward greater aridity, or it may initiate a change in local climate. Desertification does not occur in linear, easily mappable patterns. Deserts advance erratically, forming patches on their borders. Areas far from natural deserts can degrade quickly to barren soil, rock, or sand through poor land management. The presence of a nearby desert has no direct relationship to desertification. Unfortunately, an area undergoing desertification is brought to public attention only after the process is well underway. Often little or no data are available to indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the rate of degradation. Scientists still question whether desertification, as a process of global change, is permanent or how and when it can be halted or reversed.

==Prehistoric patterns==

Desertification is a historic phenomenon; the world's great deserts were formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts, large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, extend well beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]]. Many deserts have come about around western asia because of an overpopulation of prehistoric species and subspecies during the late [[Cretaceous]] era.

Through [[Palynology|dated fossil]] [[pollen]], it has been found that today's [[Sahara]] [[desert]] has been changing between desert and fertile [[savanna]]. Studies also show that advance and retreat depend on yearly rainfall.

==Historical and current desertification==
* ''See, [[Timeline of environmental events]]''
Desertification became well known in the 1930s, when parts of the [[Great Plains]] in the United States turned into the &quot;[[Dust Bowl]]&quot; as a result of drought and poor practices in farming, although the term itself was not used until almost 1950. During the dust bowl period, millions of people were forced to abandon their farms and livelihoods. Greatly improved methods of agriculture and land and water management in the Great Plains have prevented that disaster from recurring, but desertification presently affects millions of people in almost every continent.

Desertification is widespread in many areas of [[China]]. The populations of rural areas have increased since [[1949]] for political reasons as more people have settled there. While there has been an increase in livestock, the land available for grazing has decreased. Also the importing of [[European]] [[cattle]] such as [[Holstein Friesian|Friesian]] and Simmental, which have higher food intakes, has made things worse.

Overgrazing has made the [[Rio Puerco Basin]] of central [[New Mexico]] one of the most eroded river basins of the American West and has increased the high [[sediment]] content of the river.

==Countering desertification==

A number of schemes have been tried to reduce the rate of desertification and regain lost land. [[legume|Leguminous plants]], which use [[nitrogen]] they extract from the air, can be planted. Stones placed around the base of trees increase the shade available for plants and insects. Artificial grooves in the ground can be dug to retain moisture and trap wind-pollinated seeds. In [[Iran]] [[petroleum]] is being sprayed over semi-arid land with crops. This coats seedlings to prevent moisture loss and stop them being blown away. Windbreaks made from trees and bushes to reduce soil [[erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]] was widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the [[1980]]s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

With many of the local people using trees for firewood and cooking the problem has become acute. In order to gain further supplies of fuel the local population add more pressure to the depleted forests; thus adding to the desertification process. [[Solar ovens]] are being advocated as a means to relieving some of this pressure upon the environment.

While desertification has received tremendous publicity by the political and news media, there are still many things that we don't know about the degradation of productive lands and the expansion of deserts. In 1988 [[Ridley Nelson]] pointed out in an important scientific paper that the desertification problem and processes are not clearly defined. There is no consensus among researchers as to the specific causes, extent, or degree of desertification. Contrary to many popular reports, desertification is actually a subtle and complex process of deterioration that may often be reversible.

At the local level, individuals and governments can help to reclaim and protect their lands. In areas of sand [[dune]]s, covering the dunes with large boulders or [[petroleum]] will interrupt the wind regime near the face of the dunes and prevent the sand from moving. [[Sand fence]]s are used throughout the [[Middle East]] and the United States, in the same way [[snow fence]]s are used in the north. Placement of straw grids, each up to a square meter in area, will also decrease the surface wind velocity. Shrubs and trees planted within the grids are protected by the straw until they take root. However, some studies suggest that planting of trees actually depletes water supplies in the area. [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7749] In areas where some water is available for [[irrigation]], shrubs planted on the lower one-third of a dune's windward side will stabilize the dune. This vegetation decreases the wind velocity near the base of the dune and prevents much of the sand from moving. Higher velocity winds at the top of the dune level it off and trees can be planted atop these flattened surfaces.

Oases and farmlands in windy regions can be protected by planting tree fences or grass belts. Sand that manages to pass through the grass belts can be caught in strips of trees planted as wind breaks 50 to 100 meters apart adjacent to the belts. Small plots of trees may also be scattered inside oases to stabilize the area. On a much larger scale, a &quot;[[Green Wall]],&quot; which will eventually stretch more than 5,700 kilometers in length, nearly as long as the [[Great Wall of China]], is being planted in northeastern China to protect &quot;sandy lands&quot;--deserts believed to have been created by human activity.

More efficient use of existing water resources and control of salinization are other effective tools for improving arid lands. New ways are being sought to use surface-water resources such as rain water harvesting or irrigating with seasonal runoff from adjacent highlands. New ways also being sought to find and tap groundwater resources and to develop more effective ways of irrigating arid and semiarid lands. Research on the reclamation of deserts also is focusing on discovering proper crop rotation to protect the fragile soil, on understanding how sand-fixing plants can be adapted to local environments, and on how grazing lands and water resources can be developed effectively without being overused.

[[Off-road vehicle]]s significantly increase soil loss in the delicate desert environment of the western United States, which can be controlled by restrictions on such vehicles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multimedia compression''' is a general term referring to the [[data compression|compression]] of data for any type of [[multimedia]], most notably graphics, [[sound reproduction|audio]], and [[video]].

== Explanation ==

Because multimedia typically derives from data sampled by a device such as a [[camera]] or a [[microphone]], and because such data contains large amounts of random noise, traditional lossless compression algorithms tend to do a poor job compressing multimedia.
Multimedia compression algorithms, traditionally known as [[codec|codecs]], work in a [[lossy data compression|lossy]] fashion:
#Transform the data according to a model designed to reduce sample-to-sample correlation, concentrating the important signal in a few data values.
#Quantize the data, most of which has become noise.  Some codecs use a scalar quantizer followed by [[run-length encoding]]; others use [[vector quantization]].
#Use [[entropy coding]] such as [[Huffman coding]] to reduce the number of bits that the most common values use.
This method is called [[transform coding]].

Multimedia compression has become the primary focus of compression research, primarily in a search for more efficient models.
It is the most important part in [[video coding]] formats.

Almost all [[data compression]] systems can be viewed as comprising
'''four successive stages of data processing''' arranged as a processing [[pipeline]] (though some stages
will often be combined with a neighboring stage,
performed &quot;off-line,&quot; or otherwise made rudimentary).

The four stages are
:(A) Preliminary pre-processing steps.
:(B) Organization by context.
:(C) Probability estimation.
:(D) Length-reducing code.

The ubiquitous compression pipeline (A-B-C-D) is what is of interest.

* With (A) we mean various pre-processing steps that may be appropriate before the final compression engine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lossy compression often follows the same pattern as lossless, but with one or more quantization steps somewhere in (A).  Sometimes clever designers may defer the loss until suggested by statistics detected in (C); an example of this would be modern zerotree image coding.

* (B) Organization by context often means data reordering, for which a simple but good example is JPEG's &quot;Zigzag&quot; ordering.  The purpose of this step is to improve the estimates found by the next step.

* (C) A probability estimate (or its heuristic equivalent) is formed for each token to be encoded.  Often the estimation formula will depend on context found by (B) with separate 'bins' of state variables maintained for each conditioned class.

* (D) Finally, based on its estimated probability, each compressed file token is represented as bits in the compressed file.  Ideally, a 12.5%-probable token should be encoded with three bits, but details become complicated.

== Further discussion ==

=== Preliminary pre-processing steps ===

Preliminary compression steps is a catch-all including such ideas as compaction transforms (e.g. subband image coding), hierarchal decompositions, template matching, string searching, and miscellaneous tricks like the [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]]. We aren't concerned with this stage here, except to note that many such preprocessing steps fall nicely within the scope of &quot;Organization by Context.&quot; In lossy systems, any loss is usually introduced in (A), so remaining steps are the same for both lossy and lossless.

=== Organization by context ===

Organization by context often means data reordering, for which a simple example is JPEG's `Zigzag' ordering -- a simple device to sequence a vector's elements into approximate order of expected energy (or bit rate requirement).  (One important but little-remarked reason why more modern zerotree-type image compressors outperform JPEG is that they bunch similar statistics across very large image areas, while JPEG just does a 64-pel block.) 

More generally, context organization includes ''separation'' and ''concatenation'' to move data with similar context, such as adjacent pixel values, to adjacent locations in an encoding stream, or to provide a similar context character to a context-conditioned probability estimation machine.

=== Probability estimation ===
A probability estimate (or its heuristic equivalent) is formed for each token to be encoded; the estimates depend on data reordering or bin assignment in step (B). The probability estimate takes the form of a vector of k probabilities, summing to one, for k possible decision outcomes labelled 0, 1, .... k-1. Often k=2 and the outcome tokens are simply bits. 

These probabilities can be reconstructed by the decoder, so what is encoded into the compressed file is just the outcome token. Instead of using {0, 1} as the outcome token set when k=2, it is often convenient to use {MPS, LPS} -- the More and Less Probable Symbol.

Eventually this section should discuss some topics in probability estimation:

* Statistical Coding: Conditional probabilities
* Statistical Coding: The `Overtraining' problem
* Statistical Coding: Distributed estimation
* Axioms for Probability estimation: efficacy, ergodicity, insensitivity
* Static Probability estimation: offline, semi-adaptive
* Stationary Probability estimation: Bayesian
* Window-based Probability estimation: e.g. Lempel-Ziv
* Decaying-average Probability estimation: e.g. QM-coder

=== Entropy coding ===

The encoded events are converted into the bits of the compressed
data file.  Let us first separate these systems into two types. K is relatively large.  [[Huffman coding]] is popular and useful, especially when symbol probabilities were already estimated in an earlier &quot;offline&quot; effort. Adaptive Huffman coding is also in use.

K = 2.  [[Golomb coding]] and its variants like [[Langdon coding]] are simple, effective and popular; these produce output bits only when LPS is encountered. [[Arithmetic coding]] is also effective, as are their close cousins, quasi-arithmetic codes and FSM codes. An advantage of arithmetic and related codes over Golomb coding is the automatic interleaving of compressed data from multiple contexts, though chips implementing interleaved Golomb-type codes have recently been introduced by Ricoh Co., Ltd.

Intermediate values like K=3 might seem to pose a problem.  In fact, practical systems may be slightly more complicated than indicated here. Also, in some systems, e.g. LZ text coding, stages (A)-(B) of the compression system may be designed to get good compression even
with trivial (C)-(D).

== Further examples ==

Instead of a Huffman code, a simple often applicable coding device is MTF (Move To Front) followed by a simple length-reducing code such as the so-called [[Fibonacci code]].  That might be viewed as MTF is stage (B), the simple &quot;Fibo code&quot; as stage (D), with stage (C) disappearing entirely, if the Fibo code fits the model statistics well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dumbarton-Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Dumbarton Bridge seen from the western terminus.]]
The '''Dumbarton Bridge''' is the southernmost of the highway [[bridge]]s that span the [[San Francisco Bay]] in [[California]]. Carrying over 61,000 vehicles daily, it is also the shortest bridge across San Francisco Bay at 1.63 miles (8600 feet / 2622 m / 2.62 Km). Its eastern terminus is in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], near [[Newark, California|Newark]] in the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]] and its western terminus is in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]].  The bridge has three lanes in each direction, and features a separated bike/pedestrian lane on its eastbound side. Currently there is a toll charge of [[US dollar|$]]3 for cars travelling east to west. The toll plaza also allows [[carpool]]s across for free during certain hours as well as sporting two [[FasTrak]] lanes.

==Environmental factors==

When the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[aquatic]] and [[terrestrial]] environment.  Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, partiularly in some residential areas of [[Menlo Park]] and [[East Palo Alto]].  The firm of [[ESL Inc.]] was retained to conduct these studies and produce contour maps of projected [[sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme{{ref|Hogan}}.

The local area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals.  The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.

Near the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and Palo Alto's [[Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs{{ref|San}}.

On both sides of the eastern terminus of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the eastern bridge terminus is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]], running from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods

==History and engineering features==

The bridge never was officially named, but the common use name comes from Dumbarton Point, which dates to [[1876]] when it was named for [[Dumbarton]] in [[Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge, opened in on January 17, [[1927]], was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. Portions of this old drawbridge remain as fishing piers.  The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the State for $2.5 million in 1951.

Its age and the limitations of a two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span made it necessary for a replacement bridge to be constructed 90 feet to the north. This current bridge, a six-lane, high-level structure, was opened to traffic in October 1982. The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million.  The current bridge has a shoulder in each direction for emergency use and a two-way [[bicycle]] and pedestrian path on the eastbound side. A 340 foot center span provides 85 feet of vertical clearance for [[ship]]ping.  The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of prestressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.  The rail bridge is currently unused, but a successful March [[2004]] regional transportation ballot measure included funding to rehabilitate the rail bridge for commuter rail service.

==Connections to the western circulation system==

The bridge is part of [[California State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880]] by a freeway segment north of the Fremont end. However, it is not directly connected to [[U.S. Highway 101 in California|US 101]] at its southern end in Menlo Park. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge.

Although this has led to severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]], [[Caltrans]] has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to Interstate standards, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].  The freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area, thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south of the bridge.

Bus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]],[[AC Transit]], [[VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue (Mayfield).

==Film credits==

An extended sequence in the movie ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' takes place on the [[1927]] span and its eastern approach.  The Dumbarton Bridge is also mentioned in the dialog of the [[1992]] film ''[[Sneakers (film)|Sneakers]]''.

The '''Dallas Cowboys''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Dallas, Texas]] [[metropolitan area]], and play their home games in the suburb of [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. They currently belong to the [[NFC East|Eastern Division]] of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Cowboys joined the NFL as a 1960 [[expansion team]]. The team is sometimes referred to colloquially as ''[[America's Team]]'' due to its having a large fanbase that lives outside its immediate local area (the term itself is derived from the title of the team's 1979 [[NFL Films]] [[highlight film]]).

The Cowboys are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NFL, holding the league records for most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985) and most seasons with at least 10 wins (24). The team has earned the most postseason appearances (27, as of 2004, which includes another league record of 54 postseason games, winning 32 of them) and the most [[Super Bowl]] appearances (8). The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls in just 4 years (a feat that has been matched only once since, by the [[New England Patriots]]), and are tied with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for having the most number of Super Bowl wins (5).

:'''Uniform colors:'''  White jerseys have royal blue numbers and lettering; colored jerseys feature a darker shade of blue as background (similar to that of the star logo shown to the upper right) with white numbers and lettering.  By tradition, and unlike most NFL teams, the Cowboys normally wear their white jerseys at home (although they may wear their colored jerseys during special occasions). In the 2003 season, the Cowboys revived their 1962 [[throwback]] uniform (blue jersey with white sleeves) for special occasions such as Thanksgiving and a September 19, 2005 game against the [[Washington Redskins]].  That particular game was the Cowboys' first ever home game against the Redskins in which they opted to dress in their colored jerseys.

==Franchise history==
===1960s===
Originally, the formation of an NFL expansion team in Texas was met with strong opposition by [[Washington Redskins]] owner, [[George Preston Marshall]]. Despite being located in the nation's capital, Marshall's Redskins had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the Southern States of the US for several decades, so a new team in Texas was unwanted competition.  This came as little surprise to would-be team owners, [[Clint Murchison, Jr.]] and [[Bedford Wynne]], so to ensure the birth of their expansion team, the men bought the rights to the Redskins fight song, &quot;[[Hail to the Redskins]]&quot; and threatened to refuse to allow Marshall to play the song at games.  Needing the song, which had become a staple for his &quot;professional football team of Dixie&quot;, Marshall changed his tune, and the city of [[Dallas, Texas]], was granted an NFL franchise on [[January 28]], [[1960]]. This early confrontation between the two franchises no doubt triggered what would become one of the more [[significant rivalries in the NFL]], which continues even to this day.

The new Dallas owners, Murchison and Wynne, immediately hired [[Tex Schramm]] to be the general manager and [[Tom Landry]] to be the head coach.  In the Cowboys' first season, they finished winless with a 0-11-1 record.  The following year, the Cowboys made their first NFL draft selection, selecting [[Bob Lilly]] with the 13th pick in the draft.  The year 1961 also saw the Cowboys' first victory, a 27-24 win over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on [[September 17]].

During the 1960s, the Cowboys continued to improve their team.  [[Quarterback]] [[Don Meredith]] and [[running back]] [[Don Perkins]] joined the team and by 1966, the Cowboys had their first winning season (10-3-1; which began a record-setting streak of 20 straight winning seasons, unmatched by any other NFL team) and their first playoff appearance. Although the playoff game was a 34-27 loss to the [[Green Bay Packers]], it marked the start of a record-setting eight consecutive playoff appearances. (The Cowboys would later match and extend that record, raising the bar to an NFL record 9 straight playoff appearances in 1983.) By the mid-60s, the Cowboys had become a powerful force in the NFL, sending eight players to the [[Pro Bowl]] including Cowboy legends: [[Bob Hayes]], [[Chuck Howley]], &quot;Dandy&quot; Don Meredith, Don Perkins, and future Pro Football Hall of Famers, Bob Lilly and [[Mel Renfro]].

Similarly, the Cowboys were becoming an important part of the people of Dallas.  For their first years, the Cowboys were always playing second fiddle to [[Lamar Hunt]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]] because the Texans were the more established team and had the better record.  But in 1963 when the Texans moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and became the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], the Cowboys became the only professional football draw in town.  By 1969, ground was being broken on a new stadium for the Cowboys to replace the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]].  [[Texas Stadium]] in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], a [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] suburb, would be completed for the 1971 season.  Since they didn't leave Dallas County, there were no moves to change the name of the team.

In 1967, the Cowboys finished with a 9-5 record and had their first playoff victory: a 52-14 affair over the [[Cleveland Browns]].  They went on to face the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the NFL Championship game.  The game, which happened on [[December 31]], 1967 at [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], turned out to be one of the coldest NFL games on record (about -13&amp;deg; [[Fahrenheit|F]] with a -40&amp;deg; [[wind chill]]).  The Cowboys lost 21-17 on a one-yard [[quarterback sneak]] by Packers quarterback [[Bart Starr]].  The game would later come to be known as the &quot;[[Ice Bowl (NFL)|Ice Bowl]].&quot;

===1970s===
In the 1970s, the NFL underwent many changes as it absorbed the AFL and became a unified league, but the Cowboys also underwent many changes.  Meredith and Perkins retired in 1969 and many new players were joining the organization, like [[Cliff Harris]], [[Lee Roy Jordan]], [[Rayfield Wright]], [[Dan Reeves]], plus Pro Football Hall of Famers [[Mike Ditka]] and [[Roger Staubach]].  Led by quarterback [[Craig Morton]], the Cowboys made it to their first [[Super Bowl]], a mistake-filled [[Super Bowl V]], where they lost 16-13 to the [[Baltimore Colts]] courtesy of a [[field goal]] by Colts' kicker [[Jim O'Brien]] as time expired.    However, the disappointing Super Bowl loss was made up for the next year when the Cowboys, led by Staubach, won their first NFL Championship in 1971, [[Super Bowl VI]], a 24-3 victory over the [[Miami Dolphins]].

The Cowboys were now beginning to grow in popularity not just in Dallas, but nationwide.  Their televised appearances on [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] games beginning in 1966 helped bring the Cowboys to a nationwide audience.  Under Tom Landry, the so-called &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot; became a powerful and dominating force in the NFL and their offense was also exciting to watch.

The Cowboys faltered slightly in 1974, missing the playoffs for the first time in eight years.  However, the Cowboys drafted well following the season, adding new legends like [[Randy White (football player)|Randy White]] and [[Hollywood Henderson|Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson]].  The fresh influx of talent helped the Cowboys to [[Super Bowl X]], where they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 21-17.  But the Cowboys would again taste Super Bowl victory, defeating the [[Denver Broncos]] 27-10 in [[Super Bowl XII]].  Bob Ryan, an NFL films editor, would dub the Cowboys &quot;America's Team&quot; following this season, a nickname that has earned derision from non-Cowboys fans but has stuck through both good times and bad.

The glory days of the Cowboys in the 1970s were coming to an end.  They would reach one final Super Bowl, [[Super Bowl XIII]], losing once again at the hands of the Pittsburgh Steelers, 35-31, despite a last-minute effort by Staubach which failed.  Roger Staubach retired following the 1979 season (replaced by punter [[Danny White]], who did double-duty as quarterback and punter for a few years) and the Cowboys' stardom seemed to fade in the NFL.

===1980s===
While the Cowboys would return to the playoffs 5 times and win 2 Division Championships, the team failed to claim a single Conference Championship in the 80's and would not return to the Super Bowl during that decade.

In the 1981 [[NFC Championship|NFC Championship game]], the Cowboys lost to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] on a [[touchdown]] pass from [[Joe Montana]] to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute of play.  Clark's famous leap in the end zone would come to be known as &quot;The Catch&quot; and represented a changing of the guard in the NFC from the dominant Cowboys teams of the 1970s to the dominant 49ers teams of the 1980s. 

In 1984, [[Bum Bright|H.R. &quot;Bum&quot; Bright]] purchased the Dallas Cowboys from Murchison, but following seasons that were getting progressively worse (1985: 10-6; 1986: 7-9; 1987: 7-8; 1988: 3-13), Bright sold the Cowboys to [[Jerry Jones]] on [[February 25]], [[1989]].  Jones promptly fired Tom Landry, the only coach the Cowboys had ever known, and replaced him with [[University of Miami]] head coach, [[Jimmy Johnson (football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]].  This also led to the retirement of quarterback-punter [[Danny White]], who (like Roger Staubach) worked closely with Landry. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected quarterback [[Troy Aikman]] and traded away veteran running back [[Herschel Walker]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for five veteran players and eight draft choices.  The Cowboys finished the 1989 season with a 1-15 record, the worst record since the team's inception, but the foundations for the Cowboys' return to glory had been set.

===1990s===
In 1990, the Cowboys drafted running back [[Emmitt Smith]] and the trifecta of Aikman, Smith and [[wide receiver]] [[Michael Irvin]] was now set.  The Cowboys finished 7-9, but Smith was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year and [[Jimmy Johnson]] was selected as Coach of the Year.  By 1991, the Cowboys finished with an 11-5 record, making the playoffs for the first time in six years.

In 1992, the Cowboys finished 13-3 (second best in the league) and exacted their revenge on the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 30-20.  The Cowboys went on to defeat the [[Buffalo Bills]] in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], 52-17. Jimmy Johnson became the first coach to claim a National Championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football. The following season, the Cowboys went 12-4, again defeating the 49ers in the NFC Championship and again defeating the Buffalo Bills in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]], this time by a margin of 30-13.  The Cowboys sent an NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl: Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, [[Thomas Everett]], [[Daryl Johnston]], [[Russell Maryland]], [[Nate Newton]], [[Ken Norton Jr]], [[Jay Novacek]], [[Mark Stepnoski]] and [[Erik Williams]].

However, Jimmy Johnson and [[Jerry Jones]] had a falling out, so Johnson left the organization prior to the 1994 season.  Jones hired former [[University of Oklahoma]] head coach [[Barry Switzer]] to be the team's new head coach.  The Cowboys would finish 12-4, but lost in the NFC Championship game to the 49ers, 38-28.  However, another 12-4 season in 1995 would earn the Cowboys a fourth straight Division Championship (17th total) and send the Cowboys to the playoffs once more where they claimed their 8th NFC Championship title by defeating the Green Bay Packers, 38-27. The Cowboys eventually defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 in [[Super Bowl XXX]], getting revenge against the Steelers for the two four-point losses in [[Super Bowl X]] and [[Super Bowl XIII]].

However, the glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as [[free agency]] and injuries began taking their toll.  The Cowboys went 6-10 in 1997, with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions, and in January of 1998, Switzer resigned.  Former Steelers offensive coordinator [[Chan Gailey]] was hired to take over head coaching duties.  Gailey led the team to a 10-6 record in 1998, but was let go after an 8-8 season in 1999.

===2000s to present===
Defensive coordinator [[Dave Campo]] was promoted to head coach, but he could only post three consecutive 5-11 seasons, with his fate likely being sealed by an opening day loss in 2002 to the expansion [[Houston Texans]].  Many fans and media were beginning to blame [[Jerry Jones]] for the team's ills, noting that he refused to hire a strong coach, preferring to hire coaches who didn't want to be involved with personnel duties so that Jones himself could manage them.

However, Jones proved them wrong in 2003 by luring [[Bill Parcells]] out of retirement to coach the Cowboys.  The Cowboys became the surprise team of the 2003 season, posting a 10-6 record with the best overall defense in the NFL.  However, the 2004 season was one of turmoil.  Injuries and persistent penalty problems hobbled the Cowboys, but a preseason quarterback controversy also caused trouble when [[Quincy Carter]] was suddenly terminated for drug use in favor of 40-year-old veteran [[Vinny Testaverde]], brought to the Cowboys from the New York Jets by his former coach in the off-season.  The Cowboys started strong, with victories against the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Washington Redskins]], but quickly fell off to a 3-5 record by midseason, finishing the season 6-10.

In November of 2004, a vote was passed by the City of [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] in [[Tarrant County]] to build a new stadium adjacent to the existing [[Ameriquest Field in Arlington]]. The deadline for either the City of Arlington or the Dallas Cowboys to back out of the deal for the new stadium has passed.  The team will begin playing at the new site in 2009 after thirty-eight years playing in the City of Irving, and forty-nine years in the entire Dallas County.

The Cowboys improved their defense before the 2005-2006 season with the additions of first round draft picks [[Demarcus Ware]] and [[Marcus Spears (defensive end)|Marcus Spears]].  Parcells drafted these two in the hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional 4-3 defense to a 3-4 defense, which he believes favors the talents (speed and athleticism over power) of the current lineup.  Jerry Jones also added a number of savvy veteran players, acquiring [[nose tackle]] [[Jason Ferguson]] and [[cornerback]] [[Anthony Henry]] via free agency, and [[linebacker]] [[Scott Fujita]] via the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back [[Julius Jones]], acquiring both [[quarterback]] [[Drew Bledsoe]] and [[wide receiver]] [[Peerless Price]] via free agency. (Price's contribution to the team was meager, and he was released at the end of the 2005 season.) During his tenure, Parcells has made a point of signing players that have played for him in the past, including Bledsoe and [[wide receiver]] [[Terry Glenn]] (both with the Patriots); [[cornerback]] [[Aaron Glenn]], [[wide receiver]] [[Keyshawn Johnson]] and [[fullback]] [[Richie Anderson]] (all with the Jets; Anderson is no longer with the Cowboys).

The Cowboys began their 2005 campaign on the road, winning a close road game against the [[San Diego Chargers]] 28-24.  In Week 2 (a.k.a. NFL Hurricane Relief Week), the Cowboys wore their 1962 throwback jerseys for the first time that year, as they hoped to pound the [[Washington Redskins]] (one of their division rivals) into the ground.  For most of the game, the Cowboys dominated the game, leading 13-0 for three quarters.  Unfortunately, the defense couldn't hold off a late-game comeback and fell 14-13 to two [[Mark Brunell]] TD passes to [[Santana Moss]].  In Week 3 &amp; 4, the Cowboys traveled to the Bay Area to face the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Oakland Raiders]].  The Cowboys won a close game against the Niners (34-31), but lost a tight game against the Raiders (19-13).  Afterwards, the Cowboys went home and took on their NFC East rivals.  First, they won against the defending NFC Champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 33-10 and then beat the eventual NFC East champion [[New York Giants]] in overtime 16-13, with [[Jose Cortez]]'s 51-yard field goal.  Then, on their road trip to Seattle, the Cowboys took on the Seahawks and played a close game with them. Unfortunately, Drew Bledsoe's late-game pass was intercepted by DB [[Jordan Babineaux]] and the Cowboys fell 13-10.  However, they dominantly prevailed at home over the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 34-13.  They then used their Week 9 Bye to prepare themselves for a Week 10 Monday Night Showdown in Philadelphia.  The Cowboys trailed for most of the game, but then, late in the fourth quarter, the Cowboys came within striking distance (20-14).  When [[Donovan McNabb]] tried to pass to [[Reggie Brown]], [[Roy Williams (DB)|Roy Williams]] intercepted the pass and ran 46 yards for the game-winning touchdown (21-20).  Afterwards, they went home and defeated the [[Detroit Lions]] 20-7.  On Thanksgiving Day, the Cowboys donned their '62 throwback jerseys again, as the [[Denver Broncos]] came to town.  Both sides played hard and fierce football.  Yet, the Cowboys fell to the Broncos in overtime 24-21, on a 24-yard field goal by [[Jason Elam]].  They then traveled to Giants Stadium and lost a close game to the Giants 17-10.  The Cowboys would get redemption at home as the narrowly beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] 31-28.  Unfortunately, when the Cowboys traveled to [[FedEx Field]] for a rematch with the Redskins, Drew Bledsoe wasn't safe.  He was sacked seven times and they turned the ball over four times as the Redskins pummeled the Cowboys from start to finish.  Basically, the Cowboys trailed from the start and failed to catch up, as they were swept by the Redskins for the first time since 1995 by a final score of 35-7.  However, the Cowboys wouldn't let that loss shake them up.  In their last road game of the season, they took on the [[Carolina Panthers]].  Trailing 20-17 late in the game, [[Billy Cundiff]] tried to tie the game with a field goal.  The Bad News: CB [[Ken Lucas]] got his middle finger on the ball and it sailed wide right.  The Good News: DE [[Julius Peppers]] was called for roughing the kicker.  That penalty would set the stage for Drew Bledsoe's 2-yard Touchdown pass to [[Terry Glenn]].  The Cowboys would win 24-20.  Unfortunately, their playoff hopes were dashed when the Redskins defeated the Philadephia Eagles. Even if Dallas and Washington had ended their regular seasons at 10-6, the Redskins would have advanced to the playoffs because of their two victories against Dallas. The Cowboys, knowing that they could not make the playoffs, went into Sunday night playing the [[St. Louis Rams]] on ESPN's last Sunday Night Football game. The Cowboys lost the game 20-10, and finished the season with a 9-7 record, and in 3rd place in the NFC East.

Due to the rich history of the Cowboys from the 1960's, 1970's and 1990's, one would assume that the Cowboys would have a large number of inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Unfortunately, however, they do not.  Many have raised strong arguments asking why many Cowboys legends have been snubbed by the Hall's induction committee, especially those who played during the decade of the 1970's.  On the Pro Football Hall of Fame's 1970's all-decade team (selected by the same group as the one charged with picking the inductees), there are six Dallas Cowboys ([[Drew Pearson (football player)|Drew Pearson]], Rayfield Wright, Roger Staubach, [[Harvey Martin]], Bob Lilly, and [[Cliff Harris]]) and eight Pittsburgh Steelers ([[Lynn Swann]], [[Mike Webster]], [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Franco Harris]], [[LC Greenwood]], Mean [[Joe Greene]], [[Jack Ham]] and [[Jack Lambert]])*.  Of those, only three Cowboys have been inducted (Wright, Staubach and Lilly) versus seven Steelers (all but Greenwood).  Not including the two kickers and one punter on the team, the three Cowboys are among only eleven players on the forty-five man roster not in the Hall.  

The most notable among the three is Pearson, who has campaigned to raise awareness in NFL circles about the supposed Anti-Cowboys prejudice.  Perhaps the biggest case to be made for Pearson's induction is the 2001 induction of Pittsburgh's Swann, who played in the same era as Pearson at the same position (wide receiver).  He caught only 336 passes for 5,462 yards in his career to Pearson's 489 and 7,822, respectively.  Overall, the Cowboys have nine inducteed to the Hall**, which ties them for twelfth.  

However, those that would argue with the conspiracy theorists point out that many of the teams ahead of Dallas in number of inductees have been around much longer.  The top five teams (the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Green Bay Packers]], [[New York Giants]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Washington Redskins]], respectively) were all founded in 1933 or before.  The Cowboys were founded in 1960.  Others argue that the defensive players for the Cowboys in the 1970's operated under an ingenious system devised by Head Coach Tom Landry (see above) which inflated the public's perception of their supposed skill.  The debate over an anti-Cowboys bias still rages today:

http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/columnists/bharvey/stories/MYSA020406.1C.COL.FBNharvey.cowboys.21f0406f.html

(*)The NFL does not officially identify players with the team with whom they played most of their career.  All teams for whom a player played are recognized equally.

(**)Numbers do not include players who played a minority of their career with the Cowboys or other teams.  For example, Lance Alworth played for the San Diego Chargers from 1962-1970, and with the Cowboys from 1971-1972.  He is not included in the nine for the Cowboys, nor is Mike Ditka, who played for 8 years with the Bears and Eagles before ending his career with a four-year stint with the Cowboys.

===Super Bowl MVPs===
With the Dallas Cowboys holding the NFL record for the most Super Bowl appearances (8) and tied at 5 (with the 49ers and Steelers) for the most Super Bowl victories, it stands to reason that the team would at least be tied for the most [[Super Bowl MVP|Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Awards]]. They aren't...tied, that is. The team actually holds the record for the most SB MVP honors (7). 

* [[Chuck Howley]]'s performance as Dallas' linebacker in [[Super Bowl V]] earned him the honor, despite his team's loss to the [[Baltimore Colts]] in the big game. (As a linebacker, he was the first defensive player to win the award, which had been given to quarterbacks previously and his honor marks the only time in NFL history where a player from the losing team was chosen as MVP.)
* [[Roger Staubach]] became the fourth QB to earn MVP honors in Dallas' win over the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]].
* [[Super Bowl XII]] saw the first and only (through Super Bowl XL) tie as two Cowboys were chosen for MVP honors: DT [[Randy White]] and DE [[Harvey Martin]].
* [[Troy Aikman]] became the second Dallas QB to earn the MVP honor as he led the Cowboys back to victory in 1993 in [[Super Bowl XXVII]].
* Dallas earned its first back-to-back victory thanks in part to running back, and [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] MVP, [[Emmitt Smith]].
* Cornerback [[Larry Brown (cornerback)|Larry Brown]] returned with the championship Cowboys team to his third Super Bowl in just four years. His two key interceptions helped Dallas win [[Super Bowl XXX]] and earned him the first MVP award ever given to a cornerback.

===Retired numbers/[[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|'''&quot;Ring of Honor&quot;''']]===
Unlike many NFL teams, the Cowboys do not retire jersey numbers of past standouts as a matter of policy. Instead, the team has a [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|'''&quot;Ring of Honor&quot;''']], which is on permanent display encircling the field at '''Texas Stadium''' in Irving.  The first inductee was [[Bob Lilly]] in 1975 and by 2005, the hallowed ring contained [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|'''17 names''']], all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president.

The most recent inductees were: Aikman, Smith and Irvin, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;. The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during half time at a [[Monday Night Football]] home game against the arch-rival [[Washington Redskins]] on [[September 19]], [[2005]] (Cowboys lost 14-13).

Although the team doesn't officially retire jersey numbers, in the 2005 season, the numbers of [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|'''&quot;Ring of Honor&quot;''']] inductees Aikman (8), Staubach (12), Meredith (17), Hayes and Smith (22), Perkins and Harris (43) and Lilly (74) were not being worn by any Cowboys player.

==Broadcasters==
The Cowboys franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years: the most famous of which is [[Verne Lundquist]], who served as voice of the Cowboys from 1972 until 1984.  [[Bill Mercer]] and [[Frank Glieber]] also were Cowboys announcers from the early days of the organization until Lundquist's arrival as a color analyst.  Verne's new analyst, [[Brad Sham]], joined him in 1977, became the new play-by-play announcer in 1984 and has been with the Cowboys ever since, except for a three-year hiatus between 1995 and 1998 (when [[Dave Garrett]] was the play-by-play announcer).  2005 will be Brad Sham's 26th year with the organization; 18 of those years as play-by-play announcer.  [[Babe Laufenberg]] is the color analyst, and [[Kristi Scales]] is the sideline reporter.

The Cowboys Radio Network for many years was on [[KRLD]]; today it is now on 98.7 KLUV.

Additionally, several former players and coaches for the Dallas Cowboys picked up the broadcast microphone:   
*[[Don Meredith]] - became a [[color commentator]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' beginning in 1970. For years, he was paired alongside [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Howard Cosell]]. Meredith retired from sportscasting after the 1984 season, one year after Cosell's retirement.   
*[[Drew Pearson (football player)|Drew Pearson]] - has worked exclusively as a [[sportscaster]] for such networks as [[CBS]] and [[HBO]] since his retirement in 1983. He currently hosts the KLUV Dallas Cowboys post-game show.
*[[Daryl Johnston]] - aka &quot;Moose&quot; is a color commentator for the [[NFL on Fox]] telecasts, teaming with [[Dick Stockton]] on the sidelines.
*[[Troy Aikman]] - joined Fox's [[National Football Conference|NFC]] telecasts as a color commentator for the 2001 season. A year later, he was named to the network's lead announcing crew, teaming with [[Joe Buck]] and [[Cris Collinsworth]]. Aikman received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for his television work in 2004, and worked Fox's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in January of 2005. Aikman also hosts a weekly sports radio show which airs on Thursday from 5 p.m.-6 p.m. ET on [[Sporting News Radio]].    
*[[Michael Irvin]] - co-hosted NBC Sports studio coverage of Arena Football League games in 2003. He now co-anchors the widely-viewed Sunday football pre-game show Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown on [[ESPN]].    
*[[Emmitt Smith]] - signed on to serve as a studio analyst on the [[NFL Network]] show, NFL Total Access in August 2005.   
*[[Deion Sanders]] - worked as a sports pre-game commentator for [[CBS Sports|CBS]]' ''[[The NFL Today]]'' after retiring from the NFL in 2001. He remained with CBS until 2004 when contract negotiations failed. Sanders frequently made guest appearances on [[ESPN]], especially on the [[ESPN Radio]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] affiliate, and briefly hosted a show called ''The New American Sportsman''. In 2004, he returned to professional football, playing for the [[Baltimore Ravens]].   
*[[Jimmy Johnson (football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] - became a TV analyst for [[Fox Sports]] after retiring from coaching in 1999, and (as of 2005) he is part of their pregame show.   
*[[Butch Davis]] - after a stint as head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]], the former Defensive Coordinator and coach of the Dallas Cowboys Defensive Line is seen on NFL Playbook, an [[NFL Network]] program.
*[[Darren Woodson]] - worked as a color analyst for two NFL Europe games in the summer of 2004, before signing on as an occasional studio analyst with [[ESPN]].

The '''Denver Broncos''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]]. They currently belong to the [[AFC West|Western Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Broncos began play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL-NFL Merger]].

The Denver Broncos were a small-market team that met with little success in their early years but have since become one of the elite franchises of the league after having advanced to the [[Super Bowl]] six times. In their first four appearances, they suffered successively lopsided defeats, achieving near-legendary status as frustrated losers before winning back-to-back [[Super Bowl]] championships in 1998 and 1999 under [[quarterback]] [[John Elway]], running back [[Terrell Davis]] and coach [[Mike Shanahan]].

For most of their history they played in [[Mile High Stadium]], which became one of the shrines of professional football for its record unbroken string of sell-outs and its legendary home-field advantage (often regarded as the best in the NFL) for the Broncos, especially during the post-season. [[Mile High Stadium]] was one of the NFL's loudest stadiums, with [[steel]] flooring instead of [[concrete]], which may have given the Broncos an advantage over opponents. Since 2001, they have played at [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]], built next to the former site of Mile High Stadium.

==Franchise history==
[[Image:DenverBroncosOld.png|left|framed|Broncos logo (1968-1996)]]
Although the [[Denver Broncos]]' 39-97-4 record was the worst of any of the original eight [[American Football League]] teams, the franchise had many proud moments and several AFL superstars, including [[Lionel Taylor]] and [[Floyd Little]]. The Broncos won the first-ever American Football League game over the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]], 13-10, on [[September 9]], [[1960]]. They were the first AFL team ever to defeat an [[NFL]] team, on [[August 5]], [[1967]] when they beat the [[Detroit Lions]] 13-7. Despite their relative lack of early success, the Broncos produced some memorable games, like the 38-38 tie against the [[Buffalo Bills]] in [[1960]].

Denver has reached the [[Super Bowl]] six times, winning it in the [[1997]] and [[1998]] seasons. It is odd to remember a time, then, when Denver was the lowliest of teams, managing its first winning season in [[1973]] after thirteen years of futility. Denver, in fact, came close to losing its franchise in [[1965]], but a local ownership group took control that year and began to build the team.

In [[1967]], under head coach [[Lou Saban]], Denver took the field with almost two dozen rookies on its roster; though Saban's tenure was unsuccessful, it set the stage for later successes. In [[1973]], [[John Ralston]] coached the now-mature Broncos to a 7-5-2 record, including a dramatic tie with [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]] in Denver's first-ever ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' appearance that is still remembered as a pivotal game in Broncos history.  Ralston coached the team until [[1976]], when well-publicized clashes between Ralston and his players led to Ralston's removal.

Rookie coach [[Red Miller]], along with the [[Orange Crush Defense]] and aging quarterback [[Craig Morton]], promptly took Denver to its first playoff appearance &amp;ndash; and, ultimately first [[Super Bowl]] &amp;ndash; in [[1977]], where they were defeated by the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 27-10. Prior to [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], Denver had received very little national attention and was rarely featured on nationally-televised games.

[[Quarterback]] [[John Elway]] arrived in [[1983]]. Originally drafted by the [[Baltimore Colts]] as the #1 pick of the draft, Elway proclaimed that he would shun football in favor of [[baseball]] (he was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] to play centerfield) unless he was traded to a selected list of other teams, which included Denver. Prior to Elway, Denver had had over 24 different starting quarterbacks in its 23 seasons to that point. Elway would remain the quarterback through five Super Bowls, three under head coach [[Dan Reeves]] and two under [[Mike Shanahan]], and would end his career as the MVP of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], his last NFL game. The Broncos would lose [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[New York Giants]] 39-20, [[Super Bowl XXII]] to the [[Washington Redskins]] 42-10 and [[Super Bowl XXIV]] to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] 55-10, the most lopsided Super Bowl in history.  

In 1995, the Broncos debuted rookie running back sensation [[Terrell Davis]], who, in 1997 would finally lead the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory, in [[Super Bowl XXXII]], over the [[Green Bay Packers]] 31-24.  Although Elway was unable to complete more than 11 of his 22 passing attempts, throwing one interception and no touchdowns, Terrell Davis was able to overcome a severe migraine headache that caused him blurred vision and rush for 157 yards and three touchdowns to earn MVP honors.

The Broncos repeated the following year, defeating the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 34-19 to win [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].  Since the Elway's retirement following the 1998 season, Denver has only had one losing season ([[1999]]) and has made the playoffs as a wild card three times (in [[2000]], [[2003]] and [[2004]]), and as a division champion once ([[2005]]). However, they have won only one playoff game since Elway's retirement.  Prior to the 2005 season, the Broncos were plagued by early season success followed by late season flops. In both [[2003]] and [[2004]] they started the season 5-1 and ended 10-6.  In [[2005]], the Broncos would finally win a playoff game without Elway, defeating the defending Super Bowl champion [[New England Patriots]], ending the Patriots 10 game playoff winning streak.  Unfortunately, the following weekend, the hosting Broncos' were defeated at home by the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship by a score of 34-17.

Since the Shanahan era began, the Broncos have been known for having high-yardage running backs. ''Tuesday Morning Quarterback'' writer [[Gregg Easterbrook]] once mused that Denver’s helmets should have a label that says &quot;Insert running back, gain 1,000 yards.&quot; To wit: [[Terrell Davis]], [[Olandis Gary]], [[Mike Anderson]], [[Clinton Portis]], and, [[Reuben Droughns]] have all posted 1000-yard rushing seasons in Denver, with Davis shattering the 2,000 yard barrier in [[1998]]. In [[2005]], [[Mike Anderson]] rushed for more than 1,000 yards for the first time in five seasons. Anderson's backfield mate, [[Tatum Bell]], fell 79 yards short of 1,000 with 921. That would have made them the first two running backs in over 20 years to break 1,000 yards in a single season on the same team.

So the debate rages on: is it Denver's system, or their running backs, that are responsible for the huge numbers year-in and year-out? [http://www.footballoutsiders.com/ Football Outsiders] did a study to determine just that, and found some evidence that Denver's system of [[zone-blocking]] did aid running backs, and that most rushers who succeed in Denver will have a drop-off elsewhere. The study can be found [http://www.footballoutsiders.com/ramblings.php?p=2484&amp;cat=1 here].  It must be noted that both Droughns and Portis have had great success with their new teams after leaving the Broncos.

The letter '''D''' is the fourth letter of the Latin [[Alphabet|alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] is ''dee''. 
== History ==

|[[Image:Proto-semiticD-01.png]][[Image:Proto-semiticD-02.png]]
|[[Image:PhoenicianD-01.png]]
|[[Image:EtruscanD-01.png]]
|[[Image:GreekD-01.png]]
|}


The Semitic letter [[Daleth|Dâlet]] probably developed from the [[logogram]] for a fish or a door. There are various [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s that this might have inspired this. In Semitic, Ancient Greek and Latin, the letter was pronounced /d/; in the [[Etruscan alphabet]] the letter was superfluous, but still maintained (see letter [[B]]). Greek letter: [[Delta (letter)|&amp;Delta;]] (capital) or &amp;delta; (small) (Delta).

The [[minuscule]] (lower-case) form of D, consisting of a loop and a tall vertical stroke, developed by gradual variations on the majuscule (capital) form. In handwriting it was common to start the arc to the left of the vertical stroke, resulting in a [[serif]] at the top of the arc. This serif was extended while the rest of the letter was reduced, resulting in an angled stroke and loop. The angled stroke then developed into a vertical stroke.

==Usage==

The letter D generally takes the [[voiced alveolar plosive]] value, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/d/}} in most languages that use the Roman alphabet, including [[English language|English]]. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] d when doubled (dd) has the value {{IPA|/ð/}}, like English ''th'' in ''this''.

Digraphs of D are rare in English, although other languages use DH or DD for a [[voiced dental fricative]] (some [[Celtic languages]]) or an aspirated [[voiced dental plosive]] (some [[Indo-Aryan languages]]), or use [[affricate|affricates]] DZ, DV, or DZH.

In [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], the sound {{IPA|/d/}} means ''a little bit'', from the ancient use of the character &amp;#30340; (in the phrase &quot;&amp;#20800;&amp;#30340;&quot;) in [[Chinese written language]]. Since &amp;#30340; is no longer used in this way, [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong residents]] invented a new character &amp;#21874; (which is not supported in many Chinese systems), or simply write '''D''' instead.

==Codes for computing==
{{Letter
|NATO=Delta
|Morse=–··
|B1=●
|B2=○
|B3=○
|B4=●
|B5=●
|B6=○
}}
In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] D is codepoint U+0044 and the [[minuscule|lowercase]] d is U+0064.

The [[ASCII]] code for capital D is 68 and for lowercase d is 100; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000100 and 01100100, correspondingly.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital D is 196 and for lowercase d is 132.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#68;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#100;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

      <comment>stigma already has its own article; clarify distinction between digamma as number and stigma</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Table_Greekletters|letter=digamma2}}

{{Otheruses4|the Greek letter|the mathematical function|digamma function}}

'''Digamma''' (upper case {{polytonic|&amp;#988;}}, lower case {{polytonic|&amp;#989;}}) is an archaic letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used primarily as a [[Greek numeral]].

The letter had the phonetic value [[Voiced labial-velar approximant|/w/]].  Its original name is unknown, but was probably {{polytonic|&amp;#988;αυ}} (wau).  It was later called 'digamma' (double [[gamma (letter)|gamma]]) because of its shape.  It is attested in archaic and dialectal [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] [[inscription]]s, and is occasionally used as a symbol in later Greek mathematical texts.

It is also used as the [[Greek numeral]] 6.  In ancient usage, the numeral had the same form as the letter digamma.  However, in medieval and modern usage, the numeral has normally been written in the graphic form of a [[stigma (letter)|stigma]] ({{polytonic|&amp;#986;}}, {{polytonic|&amp;#987;}}), which historically is completely distinct from digamma; it is a medieval [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] of [[sigma (letter)|sigma]] and [[tau (letter)|tau]].  To complete the confusion, in modern times, the sequence &amp;sigma;&amp;tau; or &amp;Sigma;&amp;Tau; is sometimes used instead of the stigma symbol.

Digamma, like [[Upsilon|Y]], derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Waw (letter)|Waw]], and in its turn gave rise to the [[Roman alphabet|Roman letter]] [[F (letter)|F]].

==The sound [w] in Greek==

The sound [w] existed in Mycenean Greek, as attested in [[Linear B]] and archaic Greek inscriptions using digamma.  It is also confirmed by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name of [[Troy]], Wilusa, corresponding to the Greek name *Wilion.  The sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period. 

In [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [w] had probably disappeared before [[Homer]]'s epics were written down ([[7th century BC]]), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] defective. An example is the word {{polytonic|ἄναξ}} (king) found in the [[Iliad]], which would originally have been [wanaks]. Also {{polytonic|&amp;omicron;&amp;#7990;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}} (wine) was used in the meter where a word starting with a consonant would be expected. Further evidence coupled with cognate-analysis shows that {{polytonic|&amp;omicron;&amp;#7990;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;}} was earlier [woinos] (cf. [[Latin language|Latin]] ''vinum'' and [[English language|English]] &quot;wine&quot;).

----

'''Digamma Club''' was the original name of the Fox Club, a [[Harvard University]] [[final club]].

'''''Dilbert''''' is a popular [[United States of America|American]] [[comic strip]]. Written and drawn by [[Scott Adams]], the comic is known for its heavily [[satire|satirical]] [[humor]] about a [[white-collar]], [[micromanage]]d [[office]], featuring the [[engineer]] [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] as the [[title role|title character]]. The strip has run in newspapers since [[April 16]], [[1989]], spawning several books, an [[Dilbert#Animated series|animated television series]], a [[computer game]], and hundreds of Dilbert-themed [[merchandising|merchandise]] items.  Adams has also received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] and Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 1997 for his work on the strip. Dilbert appears in 2500 newspapers worldwide in 65 countries and 19 languages with over 150 million fans.

==Themes==
The comic strip originally revolved around the engineer [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] and his &quot;pet&quot; dog [[Dogbert]], with most action taking place in their home.  Many plots revolved around Dilbert's engineer nature or his bizarre inventions. These alternated with plots based on Dogbert's [[megalomania]]cal ambitions.  Later on, the location of most of the action moved to Dilbert's workplace at a large technology company, and the strip started to satirize [[Information Technology|IT]] workplace and company issues.  The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which are familiar to a large and appreciative audience.

''Dilbert'' portrays corporate culture as a [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]esque world of [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake and office politics that stand in the way of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and [[busy work]] praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to [[management|mismanagement]].

Themes explored include:
* Engineers' personal traits
** Lack of style
** Hopelessness in [[dating]]
** Attraction to tools and technological products
* [[Esotericism]]

* [[incompetence|Incompetent]] and [[sadism|sadistic]] management
** Scheduling without reference to reality
** Failure to reward success or penalize laziness
** Penalising employees for failures caused by bad management
** [[Micromanagement]]
** Failure to improve others' morale, lowering it instead
** Failure to communicate objectives
** Handling of projects doomed to failure or cancellation
** Sadistic [[human resources|HR]] policies with flimsy (or purely [[evil]]) rationale
* [[Corporate]] bureaucracy
* Stupidity of the general public
** Susceptibility to [[advertising]]
** Susceptibility to [[peer pressure]]
** Gullibility in the face of obvious [[scam]]s
* [[Third world]] countries and [[outsourcing]] ([[Elbonia]])
** Dilapidation
** Bizarre [[culture|cultural]] habits
** Lack of understanding of [[capitalism]]

==Characters==
The main characters in Dilbert include:
; [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] : The main character in the strip, an electrical engineer. He understands engineering well and has good ideas, but has a poor social life.  

:Dilbert is a stereotypical technically-minded single male.  Neither attractive nor blessed with tremendous social graces, Dilbert is capable but ignored at work, and struggles with his romantic life.  While he is frequently seen having dates with eligible women, the dates almost invariably end in disaster, usually in surreal and bizarre ways.  Dilbert loves computers and technology and will spend much of his free time playing with such things.

:Dilbert is the strip's Everyman, albeit of a specific sort.  Despite his intelligence, Dilbert is usually doomed to having events control him; he is generally powerless at work and too inept to improve his social standing.

:Dilbert is usually pictured wearing a white dress shirt, red and black striped tie, and black pants.  Dilbert's tie, for reasons never really explained, curls upward, as if formed by a wire.  It is alluded to in the strip that the tie curving up indicates the fact he has not had sex lately.

:Dilbert's unusual name was suggested to Adams by a co-worker; Adams later found that the name likely came from a cartoon character used by the United States Navy during World War II.

; [[Dogbert]] : Dilbert's pet [[dog]]. He is a [[megalomaniac]] intellectual, planning to one day conquer the world and enslave all humans. Once he succeeded, but got bored and quit. Often seen in high ranking consultant jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company.  Dogbert also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting, and usually dull, customers to steal their money.  However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he has been known to pull his master out of some tight jams.

:Dogbert's canine nature was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common.  

; [[Ratbert]] : A rat formerly used as a laboratory test animal. He usually gets all the lowest and most menial jobs, i.e. temp.  Ratbert is tolerated, but never liked, by Dilbert.

; [[Catbert]] : The company's evil [[cat|feline]] Human Resources director. He derives sadistic pleasure from seeing employees worry about their jobs. Merely mentioning the term &quot;layoffs&quot; causes him to wag his tail in delight.  
; [[List of minor characters in Dilbert#Bob, Dawn, and Rex, the Dinosaurs|Bob the dinosaur]] : A dinosaur who is the wedgie enforcer at the office. He was found after Dilbert realized that dinosaurs weren't extinct, they were just really good at hiding.

; [[Pointy-Haired Boss]] : The manager of Dilbert and the other engineers. He is hopelessly incompetent at management and does not understand the technical issue but always tries to disguise this, usually by talking in [[buzzword]]s he does not understand.  The Pointy-Haired Boss's actual name is never used.  In earlier strips the Boss was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager.  Later he developed his signature &quot;pointy hair&quot;.  This transformation occurred between the strip of September 20 (or possibly September 26), 1991, and the strip of October 21, 1991.

:The Boss treats his employees alternately with disdain or neglect; he is almost wholly [[sociopathic]], using them to his own ends irrespective of the consequences to them.  The Boss's level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs; his utter lack of ethics, however, is perfectly consistent.  The Boss believes Sociopath means the employees think he majored in Sociology; in fact he has alternately been credited with majoring in Art History (to look at naked statues) and Anthropology.  The latter claim was made by the Boss himself.

:Although he is often characterized by his minions as an &quot;idiot&quot;, he alone among them has succeeded socially, by marrying and fathering children. Not unexpectedly, his son is much like him. 

; [[Wally (Dilbert character)|Wally]] : One of the oldest engineers. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He is often seen carrying a cup of [[coffee]].  Wally is even more socially inept than Dilbert, and reference to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon.  Like the Pointy Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work.  Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie.  Adams has stated that Wally was based on a man who, due to a legal screw-up at work, could never be fired but would never get promoted.  This man was able to then become very lazy as he would not be punished for doing a bad job and would get no benefit from working hard.

; [[Alice (Dilbert character)|Alice]] : The company's most competent, and highest paid, engineer.  Alice has a huge, triangular hairstyle.  She is often frustrated at her work not getting proper recognition, which she believes (with some justification) is due to her gender. She also has a short, often violent temper, sometimes putting her &quot;Fist of Death&quot; to use, even against the Pointy Haired Boss.  Alice originally depicted a series of female characters, like Ted the Generic guy, and appeared for a time as the current Alice with a somewhat more normal hair style before, like the Boss, she finally developed her signature triangular hair.  Alice is claimed to be based upon a woman that Scott Adams worked with named Anita, who is described as sharing Alice's 'pink suit, fluffy hair, and take-no-crap attitude.'

; [[Asok (Dilbert character)|Asok]] : Pronounced &quot;Ah-shook.&quot;  A young intern. He works very hard but does not always get proper recognition.  Asok is intensely intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his illusions are frequent comic fodder.  Asok is Indian, and graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT). He does not eat, at least, beef.  The others, especially the Boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs.  If Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored.   If Asok's reported test scores and college accomplishments are correct, he is the smartest member of the engineering team.

; [[Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light]] : A minor [[demon]] who punishes people for small crimes by &quot;darning them to heck&quot; with his &quot;pitchspoon&quot;, a parody of [[Satan]]. Ostensibly, Phil is eventually revealed to be the Pointy-Haired Boss's brother. Adams is inconsistent with his depictions of Phil; he sometimes has horns and sometimes does not, and sometimes carries a pitchfork rather than a spoon. Adams has stated that the inconsistency is because he sometimes forgets that Phil is not supposed to have a cape, or a pitchfork.

; [[Elbonia]]ns : People from a fictional [[Fourth World]] nation, used as a parody of outsourcing. Their culture is radically different from western culture, and their [[patriarchy]] often annoys Alice. Their country is covered in waist-deep mud which they keep wet using expensive bottled water as revealed in one strip.

==''Dilbert'' in popular culture==
The popularity of the comic strip within the corporate sector has led to the character of Dilbert being used in many business magazines and publications (he has made several appearances on the cover of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'').

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Montreal's ''[[La Presse]]'', the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'', the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the Brisbane [[Courier Mail]], the ''[[Windsor Star]]'', and ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', among other publications, run the comic in the business section, separate from other comics, which together have their own section.  This is done in much the same manner that [[Doonesbury]] is now often carried only in the editorial section due to its pointed commentary.

It is the basis of a popular (though unproven) theory suggesting that the morale at a given workplace is inversely proportional to the number of ''Dilbert'' comic strips taped and posted at various desks and cubicles. A larger number of ''Dilbert'' comic strips reflects general frustration with the bureaucratic administration at the company, whereas a generally satisfied workforce sees less identification with the character of Dilbert, and consequently fewer ''Dilbert'' comic strips are displayed as mementoes. An office with ''no'' Dilbert strips, however, does not necessarily have high morale; rather, it may indicate that a truly authoritarian administration has prohibited employees from displaying them.

===Criticism===
The adoption of Dilbert as an icon for [[corporate America]] has led to Scott Adams being criticized, in some circles, for allowing his creation to be adopted and embraced by the very same corporate world his strip satirizes.


''Dilbert''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s irony admits few serious alternatives to the corporate lifestyle, as if Adams anticipated criticism but planned through irony to disarm the critics. [[Norman Solomon]] believes the strip is insufficiently critical of CEOs and disrespectful of ordinary working people (''The Trouble with Dilbert: How Corporate Culture Gets the Last Laugh'', Common Courage Press, 1997). The idea that white collar people might be in need of more respect contrasts with a common belief that white collar career is a free choice, but [[downsizing]] and some of the pressures on Dilbert have been predicted in the 1970s by [[Harry Braverman]] (''Labor and Monopoly Capital'', Monthly Review Press, 1998 being the most recent re-issue). Dealing with those pressures would require Dilbert to be more blue-collar in terms of strife over his work process, but in Dilbert the boss can be lampooned but has to be obeyed.

[[David Noble]] (''Forces of Production'', Oxford 1986) narrated the 1950's cyberstruggle over control of the programming of then-new computerized machine tools with a clear beginning (management introduces tools programmed by back-office Dilberts ignorant of shop floor requirements), middle (union men stand and watch the improperly programmed tools create &quot;scrap at high speed&quot;) and end (management agrees that the union guys should do the programming). Solomon seems humor-challenged in his own book, but the irony in Dilbert, he feels, is a good way of avoiding serious confrontation over the best allocation of workplace control.

[[Peter Drucker]] and [[C. Wright Mills]] both pointed out the paradox on which the strip is based but does not address: Dilbert, Wally, Alice and the rest of the gang are at one and the same time supposed to compete with each other, and produce a collective product. The strip satirizes the victims of this double bind. Solomon's concern is that it reconciles people to their fate, and doesn't show them a way out.

The flaw in some of these criticisms might be the possible assumption on the part of their authors that people would use ''Dilbert'' as a role model, as opposed to merely finding it a one or two minute &quot;funny&quot; on a daily basis.

===Language===
Terms invented by Adams in relation to the strip, and sometimes used by fans in describing their own office environments, include &quot;'''Induhvidual'''&quot;. This term is based on an [[American English]] expression &quot;[[duh]]!&quot;. The conscious misspelling of ''individual'' as ''induhvidual'' is a pejorative term for people who are not in the '''DNRC''' ([[Dogbert's New Ruling Class]]). Its coining is explained in [http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/html/newsletter06.html Dilbert Newsletter #6].

The strip has also popularized the usage of the terms &quot;[[cow-orker]]&quot; and [[Pointy Haired Boss|PHB]]. The word &quot;frooglepoopillion&quot; is now occasionally used to describe an extremely large number, after a strip which revealed that the company for which Dilbert worked owed so much money that no name existed to describe the number, so the marketing department was promptly set to work on it, coining &quot;frooglepoopillion&quot;.

Some fans have used &quot;Dilbertian&quot; to analogize situations in real life to those in the comic strip.

===Management===
In 1997 Scott Adams masqueraded as a management consultant to [[Logitech]] executives (as Ray Mebert), with the cooperation of the company's vice-chairman. He acted in much the way he portrays management consultants in the comic strip, with an arrogant manner and bizarre suggestions, such as comparing [[Strategic planning#Mission statements and vision statements|mission statement]]s to [[broccoli]] [[soup]]. He convinced the executives to replace their existing mission statement for their New Ventures Group, &quot;to provide Logitech with profitable growth and related new business areas&quot;, with &quot;to scout profitable growth opportunities in relationships, both internally and externally, in emerging, mission inclusive markets, and explore new paradigms and then filter and communicate and evangelize the findings&quot;.

In order to demonstrate what can be achieved with the most mundane objects if planned correctly and imaginatively, Adams has worked with companies to develop &quot;dream&quot; products for Dilbert and company. In 2001 he collaborated with [[IDEO]], a design company, to come up with the &quot;perfect cubicle&quot;, a fitting creation since many of the Dilbert strips make fun of the standard [[cubicle desk]] and the environment it creates. The result was both whimsical and practical.

This project was followed in 2004 with designs for Dilbert's Ultimate House (abbreviated as DUH). An energy-efficient building resulted, designed to prevent many of the little niggles which seem to creep into a normal building. For instance, to spare time from having to buy and decorate a [[Christmas tree]] every year, the house has a large yet inapparent closet adjacent to the living room where the tree can be stored for later holiday seasons.
